It's still on Netflix Germany. Maybe you can get a VPN..
[https://wlext.is/series/betty-en-ny/](https://wlext.is/series/betty-en-ny/) all episodes, english subtitles. i may be too late to help OP but hopefully this helps some others as netflix removed it
You do not need to pay for peacock to watch Betty en ny. Simply create an account and it will be available to you. 

Telemundo is actually showing betty en ny now if you have the channel 9pm (not sure if it’s only Monday nights or every weeknight)
how can i watchh? it's not workingg. it only have a lot of pop up ads😭😅😭
i just click through the ads to close them off and use the 'romantica' server and it works just fine for me, you can try with an adblocker as well maybe?
I don’t want to give too much a way. But I will say it’s a decent part of the story line. So just stick with it.
It will get better for sure but the first episode were just so bad
I stared watching it like a year ago and paused on episode 17 because I couldn’t stand this kinda depressing vibe around it (everything was just so negative, the way people treated Betty, all the bad things happening to Demetrio…) but I stated watching it again few weeks ago (I remember the original version and wanted to see how Betty will grow and change) and I decided to skip all unnecessary fights between Jenny and Sofia and other repetitive schemes and only watched storylines that were interesting 😋 and I have to say towards the end (after episode 77/78) it gets much better, and after the transformation much much better. We do in fact see some kind of character development and I did enjoy quite a few scenes towards the end. But yeah, the beginning sucks.
I really hope so. Since Betty presented the business plan it already got better. It’s just so hilarious how all these people can just ignore how qualified she is. And what even is Marcella‘s job 😂
LITERALLY, I think she’s just part of the firm because she’s a Valencia and like it’s family blood keeping her in the firm. Besides there are about 120 horrifying episodes of Betty en ny still not watched. Good luck tho
I think you right. And it baffles me how insecure she is (tho it’s not totally uncalled for). I actually just found that out yesterday when I browsed the sub. Never seen a single season with over a hundred episodes in any show. Hilarious
I think Sofia is pretty annoying, but when it comes to her freak outs considering Jenny I'm kinda on her side. It's probably the emotional part of me. It would've been a different story if she was "just" her husband's lover, but they both (Jenny and Efrain) were doing everything to shove the betrayal in her face. In real life I would probably just cry in the bathroom if I was in Sofia's shoes, but watching that on screen I could totally feel her rage deep in my bones. I genuinely felt sorry that she had to see Jenny everyday. For me it would be emotionally exhausting. Also, it's not like it's been years and she didn't get over it. I believe the whole story plays out within few months. She went from having a normal (?) family life to finding out her husband is a cheating liar and having to work with a brainless girl he cheated with.      
 

Sorry it's so long :'D I guess I had to let it all out :'D
I know a lot of people dislike her. And her story line maybe got a little too much air time in my opinion. However, she’s my second favorite story line. I think it’s just about perspective. She isn’t a saint for sure and she makes poor choices all the time but I feel like the story line is very relatable. So I really feel for that character.
Yes, this whole storyline was annoying (Sofia’s over exaggerated reactions and the audacity of Efrain and Jenny, it was just too much). But I liked the way Marcela tried to help her.
I think thee whole squad is so annoying. Most characters are annoying, Jenny, Patricia sometimes, Ricardo and sometimes Armando, Hugo, Efrain, Giovas etc. Even Betty is sometimes annoying. Marcela is the only character I could say is close to realistic. Flawed but realistic. Bertha I hate the most because sje cant keep her mouth shut. Sofia because shes like what?? In her 50s i guess and still acts so immature. Hugo bullying Betty for no reason like is he dumb to think what he's doing doesnt affect Betty's mental health and self-esteem?
I totally agree with you.
I don’t know at what episode you currently are 

Spoiler

but in the end she’s just a little less insecure and changed her look a little bit. She’s shown so little character development
Episode 54

.

Efrain's double standards.

I really don't understand people like Efrain. What audasity does he have to make Sophia feel bad for having a life or a boyfriend when he's paraded Jenny around for the world to see. Why do people think women are "just moms" once they have kids. Ugh! It's infuriating. 

.

Betty 🖤 Armando.

Ugh.. all of that was super awkward to watch. I honestly looked away. 😅
Episode 64

.

Miss Marcela.

She is a PRIMO example of why you don't mix work and pleasure. She cares more about her personal life than the company. Her jealousy does not defend her actions. Further, her jealousy is making her more and more unlikable. She needs therapy (even tho Armando has def been neglecting her.) Desperation is just never a good look. 

.

Beatriz's Papa.

Ugh~ he's so controlling and overprotective. I truly don't know how long I could live in that house. I know NY is expensive but still. 

.

Efrain y los niños.

"your mother is a mother, and mothers are no longer women." 
I almost threw my laptop!!

.

Patricia's outfit.

(White long sleve lacy shirt with shoulder ruffes under a black low cut dress) Her outfit in this episode is to die for! I love it so much! I want it~!
Episode 55

.

Betty's dientes 🦷

Omg! Those high school, pre-braces teeth are so bad! It's hysterical! 🤣😂🤣 It was cracking me up when I should have been paying attention to a serious scene. 

But also, qué video??? Necesitoz saberrrrr!! 😲

.

Armando's Office.

Why does *anyone* talk about private things in his office? Betty is literally a closet door away and she can hear. Especially Riccardo~ why not just go to Ricky's office. I don't get it. 

.

Sophia.

Is she effing serious? She didn't immediately call the lawyer when Efrain and Jenny moved in? She waited however many days until Bertha told her too? Besides anger mgmt issues, what is wrong with her? The attorney is doing this pro bono!!
Episode 91

For some reason I can't find this episode anywhere below and I just wanted to say... that Betty's mom has no boundries! Going through her daughters stuff?! Really?? and it wasn't even a "open diary on a bed" situation... she deliberately took the pink box out and proceeded with guessing the password :o and it's not like Betty went missing and she has to do anything to find her, she just wanted to know what happened, even though her daughter didn't want to  share.
Episode 57

.

Betty ☹️

Whoa....... What Freddy did to Betty was hardcore. I'm so upset :/ what's Armando going to do now that he knows? She'll never trust him again. Hah!

But is Armie starting to have feelings for the girl formerly known as Betty La fea in his eyes. 🙈 I still don't see it. Their coupling is just so strange.

.

Ricky's love song for Marce.

Lolololol! I literally giggle every time that jingle plays.
Episode 61

.

Ines.

Ugh! I'm so glad that tired, played out view about women is dying off. No offense to Ines but ~ blah! Telling Sophia she can't move in with Charly, her very good friends and godfather to her children, because he is single. Did she offer up her place? smh "women must appear chaste" 😑

.

Armando.

Wow.. he's lying yet still somehow more honest with Betty than he's ever been with a Marcela. He always gaslights Marcela.... He's a terrible guy.

.

Nico.

Hah! I really do wonder how much money he has now since he invested his salary? And that makeover scene was hilarious when he looked at the price. I knew it was going to be a lot! 😅

.

Marcela.

Jealous women are ugly women. :/
She really needs to control herself. She was so unprofessional to that model. Overall, she's just so unprofessional. :/ She cost them a huge deal because she thought she could talk down to the model because she's so used to being allowed to talk down to anyone. Ugh
Episode 68

.

Divorce Court.

What a very confusing trail process....
First the Attorney was terrible. Literally no prep for Sophia. Efrain was stupid for going without an attorney if he expected to win. Efrain is stupid altogether though. 

Sophia is THE WORST kind of client. Honestly, if her case wasn't so good I wouldn't take her. I am happy with the outcome because under no circumstances was Efrain a good person. You can fall out of love, file for a divorce asap. But you cheated, then devastated your family's life by putting your lover over your children. Bad dude. He deserved that judgement. 

And now that the divorce is final, hopefully we can move past this storyline. 😅

.

Birth Control Pills.

omg! What's with the guilt trip. She's in her 20s, she's gonna have sex eventually. At least she's safe. Her relationship with her family makes me so uncomfortable. Then hey wonder why she's so naive and easily bamboozled.
Episode 77

.

Cindy laying down the law with Marcela.

Bout time someone told her off. Marcela is so entitled and so unprofessional. Like, this is a business deal and it's obvious Cindy greatly influences her dad. You can be cordial even if you don't like a business partner. I'm giggled when Cindy told her not to make enemies. (Even if it was just a threat that she knew about Marce and Ricky.)

.

Sandra y Wilson.

And OMG! (From the previous episode I think) if Sandra doesn't just blurt out she's not a lesbian and wants to date Wilson I swear! 😠 She needs to listen to some Rod Stewart: 🎵 if you want my body; and you think I'm sexy; come on honey let me know!🎵

.

Betty's leering eyes.

Oh man! The way Betty looks at Armando when he enters is like staring at death. She's so pissed. He's kind of dumb not to pick up on that. Every mannerisms is different now that she is in revenge mode.

.

State Farm.

SHAMELESS OF ALL PLUGS! 😂 my'gah!
Episode 78

.

Wilson 😍.

Omg! Wilson needs to take his clothes off more. And omg! Finally a couple that is normal, likes each other and is apporiate and fun to wafch. I love this pairing!

.

Nico.

Nico's confidence is infectious. I want him as my bestie! Hah

.

Partri's Purple plum dress.

Omg! That dress is to die for! That color is amazing. So vibrant! I love sleeved dresses so much. 

.

Armando y Marcela.

Armando keeps turning Marcela down for everything... I don't know why he assumes she's just going to follow along. Like, is he stupid? Does he not know how to play the game? 🤔 

.

Nico y Patri.

lol! Nico spraying Patricia with the cologne killed me! 😂 I laughed so hard. He's so hilarious. 

And oh wow! A cryptocurrency... wow! A reference to the actual timeframe of this show. Seriously, if Nico keeps this up he will definitely become the millionaire of his dreams. And the two of them and their appetite, is just hilarious. I think it would be so funny, but inappropriate, if they ended up together! Beware all restaurants!
Episode 80-87

 

THE REVEAL WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

Wow! That was an intense group of episodes. Super acting from everyone!

ARMANDO
It's incredibly frustrating how he is incapable of just saying how he feels or what he thinks and just allows others to talk him down. He's always on the defense. He needs to learn offense.


MARCELA
I don't like her but I'm glad she's finally seeing how much of a bad dude Armando is. She doesn't deserve someone treating her this way when even if she's a mean person. The scene where she tore up the wedding dress was so intense and stressful. I swear, if not stopped by Margarita, she would have stabbed Amando with the knife.


DANIEL
GAH! I cannot stand him. He's so holier than thou; acting like what he's been doing behind the scenes isn't much better than Armando because his pride was hurt. I was so freaking happy when Armando and Riccardo threatened to report him for corporate espionage. I need him to to face consequences like Armando and Riccardo are.


RICCARDO
O.M.G... is he dumb? How can he call himself Armando best friends, his best bro, his lifetime compadre? He's such a jerk. He can't see how he encouraged Armando to do something despicable, I am glad Marcela explained that to him. He cannot fathom Armando liking Betty because he's so bigited towards her, he can't see that Armando was able to be a normal person around her. Or maybe he can see it but he just doesn't care? Idk... All over, he's a terrible friend. I would never talk to him after this.

NICOLAS
omg! It's funny how Nico was not the mastermind Riccardo and Armando thought he was UNTIL the end when it was revealed they screwed over Betty! I thought that was so funny! 


BEATRIZ MFing RINCON
👏🏾 BRAVO Beatriz, bravo! I loved that she kept her cool yet put everything out there to clear her name as much as possible with the Board. It's hard to explain to everyone who has not seen the video that she was coerced. And with the letter Nico has and the video from Ricky it should be enough to prevent her from facing any serious criminal charges (even if the show never comes to that). But my girl played them all for the fools they thought she was. Never undermine smart people, no matter how nerdy  and "stupid" they appear.

I am so happy Catalina is in Betty's life. I hope it's a good change of pace. I hope with Catalina, Betty finds the confidence to be more than her parents shadow, more than Armando's puppet and fully embrace herself, and her womanhood. 


**Overall just a fantastic arc of episodes!**
Episode 110

.

El abogado

I love the attorney's actor's voice. It's so deep, calming and commanding. I want to sit there and listen to his stories. Haha

.

Daniel

Wow! He seriously has a chip on his shoulder. I bet he's been like this ever since his parents died and "The Mendozas" took over. He felt like he would never get the respect he feels he deserved. :/ He's so annoying tho. I can't wait for Marce and MaLu to find out he's been hurting their company and Betty was truly Saint Betty. Hah!

.

Hugo

Honestly, what Fabio and Romina did to this man is despicable! I don't like Hugo but no one deserves to be treated and disrespected like that. I feel so bad for him. He looked completely heartbroken. :(

.

Efrain

What a freaking tool. He's literally the epitome of why you don't give people with poor financial knowledge large sums of money. Quarter of a million means nothing honestly. Especially if he keeps spending it the way he is.
 
.

Sofia

Who brings home a cake without a box? So weird.
Just finished ep 62.

Sofia continually refusing to use her free lawyer js exasperating. Also, she has had clear proof multiple times of Jenny being more angry when Sofia DOESN'T react to her, and yet she is always trying to be wild with her. Have some satisfaction in your own calmness, lady. At least she seems to be growing.

That being said, Jenny is probably my favorite character. Just camp and ridiculous. She's hilarious and steals the scene every time.

Patricia feels a bit curbed from earlier episodes. Like, she's still awful, but she also feels like she has slightly more depth (not a lot) now that not even Marcela takes her seriously. Enjoy her a lot more now than before. That scene where she comes into Betty's room is hilarious (also, I expect she'll connect the dots about the bear doll later).

Marcela is being a MESS, but she has made ONE mistake with the company in this whole series so far and Armando is STILL acting pissy about it when she is pressured to forgive him every time he does stupid shit and almost runs the company into bankruptcy again and again. Their relationship is so awful and I really hope this Marce + Ricardo thing sticks.

About Nicolas and his Mogollon suits!!! I am a man and as someone who used to work a more corporate job than I do today, ONE GOOD SUIT is way better than a week's worth of cheap suits. Two+ are preferable but if you're career doesn't require you to wear them often then having the one to show off with is worth more than looking chealà. (even if people notice you only have 1 suit, looking nice & cheap is better than just looking cheap)
Episode 51

.

Karaoke.

Omg! Betty is brave but I guess anyone can be brave if their super drunk! 😅

.

Magical Realism.

I don't think the fantasy novel screen at the end of the episode truly counts as magical realism but the is the first time the show has shown a scene like this! It's funny nonetheless! 

Also, who reads out loud at work at in public like that (Aura María and Betty)? That's just so weird! 

.

(Señor) Armando.

OOOOOOOOH THE SLIP UP! Marcela is about to Unleash the Dragon on Featriz! 🐉😲⚰️
Episode 53

.

Feliz Cumpleaños Beatriz! 🥳🎈🎉🎂

But... How old is Betty? They never said?  Odd....
Episode 56

.

The Heart Box.

HAHAHAHAHAHA!! Armando acts like he's never cheated on Marcela before? Why is he doing everything at work, in a room with glass doors, with his door open?! When Marcela walked in I almost died laughing!!! He is literally the ONLY idiot on his show!
Episode 95

.

Betty's coming out of her turtle shell

Yes! Betty in a bathing suit, showing off skin and embracing how beautiful she is. I miss seeing Catalina~ where is she? Joaquín's character is a little weird of a pairing for Betty but... At least everyone around her has been nice so farm. Unlike the absolutely terrible people at V&M! 

.

Betty's padres...

Ugh! Her parents are insufferable! Maybe it's because my parents weren't very close to me? But they don't respect her as an adult at all. I truly can't stand parents who do this. They left the nest so why wouldn't they children? Omg! No wonder she wants to hide everything.
Episode 96

.

Joaquin

I don't know about this dude. I don't like how forward he is but I'm glad Betty made him realize consent is always necessary! Some very "woke" conversations without being too overzealous about it  I also think it's so funny they made fun of his Spaniard's lisp accent! I just about died there! lol

I'm so happy he told Betty to stop giving the bullies power and to take charge of her inner & outer beauty. Even tho her mom has said this for years, it's different hearing it from someone who does not have to say it. It's a beautiful thing.

.

Catalina

What a classy lady. Defending Betty while still respecting her enough to let her  make her own choice. Laying the smackdown on Marcela only a way a lady knows how. And telling Betty the hard truth at the end of the episode.

.

The Love Story

I've been through something like Betty... I'm not sure if the show is trying to get us to root for Armando or not but seriously what he did was so wrong. I love my ex-husband, always will too, but i don't know if I can ever forgive him enough to trust again. I have no idea how or even why Betty would get over what Armando did just to be with him again.
Episode 100

.

LA NUEVA BETTY

Love her look for the occasion! 
I've been in full face makeup only one time in my life. It was interesting. I definitely didn't feel like me. But I did look super glamarous! I'm so excited someone was decent to Betty and not because they thought she was hideous but because they accepted her into the fashion world and did what they thought would enhance what is naturally her. (Although, gotta be honest, hate the word "enhance" when used like this.)

This was in the previous episode bit I especially loved with Joaquin showed photos of Betty on the beach at his stoore - as looked so comfortable being. I thought those photos we absolutely beautiful!

.

Marcela

I do pity Marcela some. I've actually been in the exact situation as her, unfortunately. :/ I'm glad I don't drink tho. I could see myself drinking into a crazy stupor 3 years ago when that situation went down. Break-ups like that (I mean all breakups suck but some are just a tiny bit more difficult) can really take a toll on someone's psyche. 

However, she sure did go to revenge quickly. It's been 3 years and I haven't been able to do that. lol
 
.

The Squad

Seriously! Do they do anything but gossip LOUDLY in the most insecure places ever? Omg! I could never have any of them as my secretary... 

.

Daniel

What an ass..... Going to Berry's family's home and threatening then. He's weaker than Armando and that's saying a lot bc Armando is so weak. He has such an inferiority complex it's infuriating to watch. I bet the actor is super nice in person but he plays insufferable so well.
Episode 105

 .

"THERE ARE NO UGLY WOMEN, ONLY POOR WOMEN."

Lolol!! The theme of this entire show! Hah! I love it.
Episode 112 (and some from 111)

.

Daniel.

Yesssssss!! The glass walls are finally falling around him and it couldn't be more satisfying. He was always so insufferable! That scene at the hospital where he pretended to be hurt when the detective mentioned Mata was so hilarious.

.

Armando

I was honestly so upset when the police tried to pin things on him with their incredibly flimsy circumstantial evidence. :/

.

Efrain

What a tool of the highest order. I thought once they were divorced we were done with this story but they insist on throwing it in our face! Sophia didn't need to hear him our. The minute she saw him she should have sent him packing.

.

Wilson

He's just a terrible security guard, verdad? Like, who doesn't face the entrance when answering a phone? 

.

Hugo

Hugo's ego is hilarious. I don't think I could stomach being around someone like that. The person Catalina brought to speak to him was super delightful to look at and listen to tho. (Miguel Varoni)
Episode 114-115

.

Armando

Seriously? Is this guy real? I do not believe FOR A SECOND this guy was ever a Playboy. Women wanted him bc of his money, not bc he was suave. Hah!

Also, why? Why did he recite Betty's diary to her? Did he think that would be romantic? Is he daft? His parents raised a spoiled fool! I'm so tired of people reading other people's diary's without consent. If someone can't even trust that their personal writings can't stay personal then there is just no hope for humanity (I'm including Betty's mom as well!)

.

Classism

You know, I never noticed it when Betty was "ugly" bit the classism is so rampant. It was masked with people's general bigotry. But I'm so tired of them acting like poor or lower middle class people can't work hard to make a name for themselves. They accuse Betty of bottom feeding, brown nosings and stealing her way to the top but they (Armando, Riccardo, Marcela in some ways and definitely Patricia) do the same thing. They didn't get where they are because of actual hard work and to stay where they are just meant to "please" others. That's why Marcela has such a hard time being okay with Betty because not only did she work hard she "turned out" to be beautiful and is embracing her confidence. She can't stand it, bc Marcela is basically just a beautiful woman born into a wealthy family. What has Marcela done to help V&M? Armando has a vision but hasn't don't anything to help V&M. Riccardo seems to only screw V&M over... Without Betty and Hugo, that company would already be over. I loved when Betty told Marcela "We're already on the verge of bankruptcy" when Marcela tried to threaten her bc of Betty's Joaquin campaign. I'm fully loving this new Betty putting people in their place!

.

Patricia...

Is so freaking hilarious! Her monologue at the end to "Piñata Betty" has me cracking up! She's one of my favorite characters even tho she is so annyoing. Hah!
Episode 118-119

.

Armando

What a creepy dude. Following Betty to see what kind of woman she is. Ugh. I'm so tired of these double standards. it's 2019 (2021) and women are still getting shamed for the transgressions men do so callously. Ugh!!

.


Sophia, et all

Well I guess we are going to ride this storyline until the show ends. It's been a nightmare and they are the only group I won't miss when the show ends.

.

Riccardo

Is he stupid? You cannot be serious with a person like MaLu and do shady things. ALSO- who the heck leaves those photos of Marcela like that on their desktop for anyone to open? These people are dumb! 

.

MaLu

If you have to snoop you shouldn't be in a relationship. Just saying~!

.

Correcto, Frank?

Oh no! What shady business is he doing? I don't like it. My professional ethics is stirring.. but boy, is he cute! 

.

The Squad, modelo

That was so amazing, seeing the Squad dressed up, sporting the new line. Some of the pieces were pretty good. Congratulations Hugo! You truly are divino, genio, even! 

.

BESOS 💋 A&B

So freaking disappointed! There are some things you shouldn't be able to come back from. Conspiring to be with someone for months and using them is an unforgettable sin no matter how much love us there. 

.

Jenny

"Oh my gas!" ~~ haha! This is such a funny saying. I am going to add it to my lexicon. That and Patricia's "Holi" 

.

~ THE MUSHY ENDING ~

Was kind of a weird, tone shift. I don't know if I liked it. Hah! It was weird seeing everyone suddenly so nice to Betty (and yes I understand a month went by) but also A MONTH PASSED and I'm like: " Did MaLu confront Ricky? Why is Daniel so drunk, why was he let in the show? Did Hugo ever get his money back, how is he living? Can we get a board meeting showing how well the ready to wear line will do? Did Betty keep in touch with Joaquin or is this the first time the are seeing each other again? Why is Marce still so jealous of Betty; she's the freaking President he has to congratulate her on the runway! If it weren't for Betty V&M would be bankrupt and that runway would have never happened. Oh yeah, did Ricky open up markets in South America? ---- SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS!
Episode 120

.

The Squad

Omg. They really are terrible, aren't they. It's one thing to gossip about your own mishaps but to tell on others, that's not a good or healthy friendship at all. Bertha can just understand the President, Betty, their friend who's been nothing but nice to them and caring wants to keep what happened out of the spotlight? Sandra is sending a copy of Ricky's video to herself? Why? It's not your business, you should have just deleted it. What was she even doing on his computer? Snooping, not saving anything honestly! Uh, they are such terrible people. Am I supposed to root for them? 

Betty shouldn't be bullied into telling them anything about what happened between her and Armando! 

.

Riccardo

He's so annoying. Maybe before the show he was a good VP but during he show he's shown nothing but jealousy, immaturity and a real lack of business sense. Ugh! Be gone, demon! 

.

*ALSO! Peacock(dot)com just updated their website and they broke the substitute system. It's in a translucent gray font color with no border shadow so I can't read anything! 😭 It was a struggle getting through this episode. I'm going to have to take a break, and I only have a few episodes left. I'll check it in a few days and see if the subtitles situation has improved. smh, it's 2021 and we still have the incredibly dumb front-facing fails.*
Episode 121

.

Joaquin & Betty

Will not last.... He is too pushy; too much pressure. It's like he makes Betty feel bad for not being as open to spontaneity as him. I'm always curious why spontaneous people date people who are planners, and then get mad at the planners for wanting to plan! Makes no sense. Date someone similar to you OR understand and appreciate the other person's differences and find a way to incorporate that into your life.

Where is Nico to give his counsel to Betty. :)

.

Riccardo

What a creep.

.

Patricia

I mean...... That old dude knows why Patricia is dating him and if he decides to give her everything then congrats Patricia for finding the "man of your dreams"! lol

.

Betty's Padres

I really don't understand parent who get so upset when their kids move away; as if children are supposed to stick to them like glue; as if they, themselves, didn't move far away from their parents. This is a very common theme in Mexican culture (I've learned from several of my Mexican friends) and Asian culture (I've learned from several of my Asian friends). But why?

I don't feel like this theme translates in Black American culture as much? Maybe because we lived in the "ghettos" and are poor historically so the notion of leaving for a better life is way more enticing. 

.

Armando / Marcela

If they marry each other i hope they at least try to be happy. Or they really shouldn't go through with it. :/ I feel has for everyone all around. It's just sad.

.

Betty

Good on her for keeping BAR! I love this assertive Boss Lady Betty! I want to be her when I grow up, but I am not as lucky! :/
Episode 71

.

All that kissing!

Hah! I miss the show when it wasn't all kissy kiddy, lovey lovey all the time! Hah.

.

Sophia and Charly.

I love them together! Super cute! :)
Episode 122-123 ~ EL FIN!

.

BETTY & ARMANDO

Nothing you can say will ever want me to see them together. He's just a stupid desperate old man and she's just a slightly less naive girl.... She can't even be honest with Joaquin about her feelings and lets him pressure her into moving. This is not a very good moral to showcase. Catalina, at the end, is literally the only mature voice of reason In this show.

. 

DANIEL

YES!!! Took them too long to arrest him! It felt so good to see. 

.

MARCELA

That was very mature of Marcela to wish Betty happiness at the hospital. She handled this situation much better than I would have. I, personally, have a hard time wishing well to someone like Armando or his next love. Someone so significant to me that hurt me like that .. I just get indifferent. For everyone else tho, I wish them well!

At the airport: I was really hoping that the little girls dad was this ultra handsome man. But it was Joaquin. I remember them saying they had a thing once so I guess that's what the writers are suggesting. Meh. She deserves someone better still. Also-- her dress was to die for!! Loved it! I need one!

.

RICARDO

Hah! Now he's being harassed! Honestly, that's sad. No one should be harassed. Even low lifes like Ricky. This also isn't a good message.

.

MS JULI

Happy to see someone on this show not just straight up forgiving Armando bc he "loves" Betty. Ugh. 

.

THE BODA

So unsatisfying to watch bc of how I feel about the betrothed. Meh. The venue of the reception looked very nice tho.

.

LA NENA

That's so mean! Betty is not even ugly but they certainly are implying the baby is. lmao

.

Well, the show is over and I'm rather indifferent. It wasn't a terrible show but it wasn't that great either. It was a show of 123 hours that helped me improve my Spanish, so it was not a complete time suck.
That motel scene was truly awful for a lot of reasons. Looking away seems like the best option...
They REALLY wanted her to look crazy :'D 

&#x200B;

You're so right! all the glass and the door that are always open :'D

&#x200B;

My thoughts exactly! She doesn't have to pay for legal advice and she still chose not to call her lawyer?!
Welcome to Mexican culture. I'm not saying it's OK, but families don't have boundaries. Betty's parents are the typical Mexican parents.
Absolutely true! It's aggravating! Who does that to their adult daughter who is also paying their mortgage. A shame.
Hmm... I'm not sure if he's fully in at this point (pardon the innuendo), but he's definitely in a different mindset that he was in the "motel episode" (imo of course).
Oh my... and it's not like Betty is living in their home for free... she's paying bills and should be treated more as a roomate than a daughter at this point... what I'm trying to say is: why is her mother cleaning her room? while she's not at home? (at least that's how I remember it) she's a grown ass woman!
Finally is somehow an understatement here. Incredibly fulfilling even if I'm still super frustrated that everyone is blaming Betty before Armando and Ricardo. If you look at it from a macro perspective, Armando's V&M is a black hole of death while Betty's BAR is prosperous AF. What do they think Betty is getting out of all of this? She clearly isn't interested in being their overlord or she wouldn't have approached this meeting with a "fuck everything" attitude.

Armando's mom is absolutely terrible, Daniel is garbage (as we knew), Marcela has... problems (though I can't really blame her here because she has been gaslighted for months/years), and Ricardo is a moron.

Everything was *fine* (well, already illegal because of Armando, but it could have worked out) until Ricardo insisted on pushing this terrible seduction scheme for literally no reason. If you want someone on their side, try befriending them and giving them benefits -- don’t shove them into a high-pressure affair trap with an man engaged with the extremely jealous other owner of the company.

Thank god for Catalina and Nico. Also Ines but she's being so stupid with this Romi stuff (Romi who is terrible at being sneaky and great at implicating herself. Girl, set up your games but let someone ELSE discover the items you've hidden). 

-----

I also wanna add:

The show is happy to tell us that Patri is a bad friend to Marce, but it ignores the fact that Marce is also a bad friend to Patri. Being friends is not throwing money at someone, ignoring their serioys circumstances, and taking everything they say at face value when they are a known pathological liar. She should have put away her credit card and taken Patri around to find a cheaper apartment. She shouldn't be enabling Patri's unreasonable, embarrassing, and frankly unhealthy lifestyle.
Hola and bienvinedo!

Jenny cracks me up! She has self esteem up the stratosphere and the way she twists words or uses her sex appeal to get what she wants cracks me up! I love her mispronunciation of English words! In fact, I've added a phrase she uses to my reptiotire already. 

Patricia is like Jenny to me, JUST awful but highly entertaining. 

Armando is a child of the highest order. He's done literally everything wrong since episode one and we're supposed to root for *him* over Marcela? It's crazy, right? Personally, I'm not a fan of Riccardo and I think she can do better than both of them. 

Nico is my favorite! His suits were gawd awful tho! They were all loose and just lifeless. I'm with you. A few good peices of professional clothing is much better than several cheap ones. When I think of suits I think of Suits (the tv show) and how amazing thier suits were!
The undertone from the show not being explicitly addressed is The Squad, Betty, Wilson & Giovas are lower class, (some what) uneducated, not politically savvy, naive and/or immature. These traits lead them to make terrible decisions on a scale many of us watching probably would not make bc we're either more educated or have more money, life experience, etc...

For instance, Marcela's level of immaturity comes from insecurity and Armando's infidelity~ we can relate to that bc a lot of us are insecure, even when she goes too far (although, she needs therapy & some self esteem boost.) But most of us are not naive enough to 100% relate to Betty or uneducated enough to behave like Sophia (like many of her anger inducing ploys plus not talking to a lawyer). It helps push The Squad and their cohort further away and making them seem even more "raro" (weird). 

I don't know if the writers did this on purpose or if this is just a product of staying too close to the source material?
I still don't see it. I understand the fact that they spend a lot of time together but just like... Those two?
Yes! This I never understood but some parents are like that. If my adult child lived with me bc I couldn't afford to live by myself if they moved out OR if my adult child lived with my because they were trying to save money while working --- I'd give them the respect and privacy their adulthood affords them. 

She's was a good kid, I'm sure, she deserves more than they are treating her. No wonder she doesn't talk to them, in their eyes she still 14 or something? That's why she behaves the way she does too.

That's also why seeing her with Armando is so awkward. It's like seeing a teenager with a middle-aged man. :/
Additionally,

getting REALLY tired of people accusing Betty of being a thief and a con artist and being generally suspicious any time she has success. She has shown time and time again that she is LEAGUES better than these rich kids at doing their jobs (and for that matter, so are Nico and even her father). She literally does not NEED to con these idiots out of shit because she has every capability to get rich *legally* while they and their connections are only able to burn through money in an instant. They consistently believe genrally incompetent people speaking in half-truths (I don't have proof but doesn't it SEEM strange?!?!) over her consistent and visible success and it is very frustrating to watch.
Riccardo's basically pimped Armando out then acted like Armando needed to think for himself and "just say no." We only saw Armando when he was with Betty so I don't know but form how the show has protrayed him he's very impressionable and just overall dumb! 

Marce and Patricia are both toxic friends to each other and it's hilariously sad they cants see it.
Thanks! It's been killing me that there are no big English communities discussing this show because I have \*so many\* feelings.

Anyway,

Just the fact that Jenny goes by "Jenny Wendy" is all you need to know how outrageous she is. She gives me Ugly Betty levels of camp amidst the A-plot drama. Is the word you added from her the one she uses for "sorority"? I can't remember what it was she said, but when Patricia corrects her all "Sorority..." and she just goes "Eso." so confidently.

Nico's expensive suit in the fitting room was so good that I was really disappointed when he picked out this iridescent blue, frumpled thing with dollar-store ties, I could NOT -- and I'm not even a person who \*likes\* formal businesswear.

I really like Marcela as a character unique of Armando. She's got some harsh faults but she is likeable and competent (except the one mistake) and it balances out. Ricardo is also terrible, though, you're right -- I just want her away from Armando because he doesn't care about her at all. Come to think of it: Armando, Ricardo, Daniel, Patricia... she's surrounded by awful people who take advantage of her!

\---

Aside: I feel like Fabio is supposed to be an ass, but the actor is so gorgeous and he has a kind face. I can't tell if he's gonna be a pure villain or if he's gonna turn out bi (a boy can dream), but I do think Romi is toxic so I can't help but feel bad for him even though he's lying to Hugo. He does seem to have taste and gives Hugo actually decent advice when he's not covering up his/Romi's tracks, so I'm hopeful for a less depressing ending.
You're right. I often forget that I look at things from my perspective. The way I said it may sound stupid, but basically, I agree that I may be too harsh on Sofia because I have a different background/education. I forget that maybe she doesn't know things I see as obvious.

Betty on the other hand is highly educated ( I think), but I guess her household (as you said before) gave her a certain mindset.
Yes!! When all of this was happening it was so irksome to hear Betty constantly being blamed. But it was especially annoying when it came from Riccardo. Like, he was in on the entire financial downfall of Armando's doing but he's acting like "Nah, bro. Ugly people are masterminds so Nico and Betty must have made the company lose all the money your bad decisions surly made". It's implausible. I guess the writers needed something to make conflict but it comes off a bit disingenuous, it makes everyone look stupid. :/
Yes! That's why we started the episode comment on this subreddit! I had so many feelings!! I had to express them.

Jenny : I don't remember what episode she started saying it but she said "Oh my Gas" instead of "Oh my God" and I was laughing so hard. I had to rewind the scene. I love it so much! She's so masterly manipulative! 

Ugly Betty was a good show. I think the hatred towards Betty in that show was not as cruel as everyone is to Beatriz.

Marcela :  is not so bad but I think she is so unfair to Beatriz. Regardless of her issues with Armando, she should not take that out on her. All her anger should go to him. She needs therapy! 

Fabio : is something else. I feel bad for Hugo.
Awesome! And welcome. Feel free to come back and discuss your thoughts on the show as you continue watching. I love hearing what people think about it :)!
Hola 👋🏽 qué tal?
We have a discussion thread on another post and we'd love to keep the commentary rolling. I just got to episode 34!
Hello :D looking forward to reading your thoughts :D
I’ll go ahead and comment on the other thread to keep commentary rolling. I just found out last night that Peacock isn’t available on Samsung tvs, so I can only watch it on my tablet or PC.
EPISODE 21.

.


ARMANDO + MARCELA.

OMG! the amount/level of lying Armando does to Marcela is infuriating. Like, how TF are they even together? Couldn't be me..... Just te your future wife Hugo made you dress in drag. It's not like we all don't know he's uber dramatic. :/

.

SOPHIA.

omg! If I see another scene where Sophia assualts Efrain and that girl one more time. Like ugh.. it's not funny, it's just sad and needlessly violent.

.

DANIEL.

Is very gross. Like, he physically creeps me out. :/
EPISODE 46

.

Catalina.

Literally the only decent person on the show. (And dare I saw one of the most beautiful! I def have a girl crush.) I cannot believe it took 46 episodes and a person outside of V&M to tell Hugo that what he says to Betty is uncalled for and rude! And further, to go find Betty and apologize. 
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
"Betty, you're beautiful. You just have to realize it." 
😭🥰😭🥰.

.

Riccardo.

Ewe... Taking photos of Marce and oogling them at work. Just 🤮
EPISODE 23.

.

ARMANDO & RICARDO.
.

These two are literally the most unqualified business executives around. They obviously only got by on their families fortunes. They operate solely out of desperation and immaturity. :/ I'm so tired of Betty getting yelled at or blamed bc Armando is an idiot. Also, like, is there the contract? Why not put things in a trust until the fabrics were delivered. He should never have been allowed to be president.

And on another note, IM TIRED OF BETTY BEING VERBALLY ABUSED! Those fantasies where she tells people off need to become real bc the abuse isn't funny, never really was. It's just been super cruel. :/

.

PATRICIA.
.

they really are trying to make us feel sorry for Patricia but it's not happening. She's so nasty and vile that whenever bad things happen to her I'm like, E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T! haha!!
EPISODE 47

.

Betty's purple dress.


OMG! WHAT 😱😱😱 Where has this bombshell been and why hasn't she worn this beautiful dress to work before??

.

Betty's "makeover".


Y'all... Why they do our girl like that? She's in her freaking 20s... Why did they make her looks a million and a half and from the 70s? smh

.

Daniel.

Uhhh... Am I wrong but can't Betty sue for the way he talked to her? I guess not.. leaving would prob be her only option. But jesus that was cruel. "Go wash off your face" like.. de qué??? I'm fuming, y'all! 

.

Jenny & Efrain. (+ Sophia)

Uh... I don't think Efrain can authorize Jenny to do anything with the kids. Where is the freaking lawyer? Did Sophia even call and explain? Bc an injunction kick (at least Jenny) them out. I truly don't think a judge would see it in the best interest of children for their parent's lover to be living with them. Seriously... This is the stupidest b-storyline; can it be over? Can we get more of Sandra and Wilson!? 

Sophia... Fire her already.
I'm honestly so tired of seeing her take things to 11 bc stupid Jenny is taunting her. Also, the Squad is terrible at "stopping" Sophia. They just watch as she ruins her life. Like take a chill pill, eat an edible. Screw Charly again, do something bc acting childish gets no sympathy from me. When she got fired by Mr Smith, I said "Good." When she was begging Marcela, I said "No, you gots ta go!" :/ You can't act like that and be rewarded. No matter how terrible your ex husband is or how new wife. Breaking her phone and yelling in the office constantly, verbally and physically assualting Jenny. No ma'am. Look... Sophia made me so upset I'm having to psuedo defend Jenny 🤦🏾‍♀️.

"You allowed yourself to get provoked Sophia."
^^^^^ exactly!!
EPISODE 1


IamcoveredinGlitter!!!  👋🏾

From the first episode I could tell the show was going to be quirky but it seems a little too much. Betty's mannerisms seems so awkward.. but like more than weird. And also, if she would just brush her hair and wear better clothes she wouldn't be a "ugly". This is set in what, 2019? What era is she from?
(Btw, I'm only on ep 5)
Episode 12

.
.

Y'all..... I just finished episode 12.. when BAR was formed and Nico made an investment..  I am so.... ugh! 😩

Also, I feel like Armando is emotionally manipulating Betty... Is it just me?

Also WILSON ~~ es muy guapo even if he's a bit clueless!
Episode 13

.
.

FASHION SHOW.


Omg.. but why tho? Why did Armando think people wouldn't know the difference when it comes to fabric? Mumm.... He's not ready to be president. Literally does not make any sense to make the runway line with trash fabric. He should have loaned his own money or cut Hugo's designs. :/

.

EFRAIN.


Omg! How can he throw away photos of his children like that. smh I had a similar experience (no children tho) and it just breaks my heart. I feel bad for Sophia, but she seriously needs to stop attacking the new gf.

.

Betty v Marcela.


One thing I've noticed growing up (I'm 35 now) is the reaction to a nurturing personality. Marcela prob feels so betrayed by Armando bc he didn't confide in her about the collection or even his feelings but he did with Betty. He feels safe with Betty, power dynamics aside, Betty believes in him and he know this. It's because of this he confides in her. Marcela believes in him but only when it's for her benefits.

I used to be more of a Marcela and I've slowly turned more into a Betty and it's made my life and the people I love and support lives a lot better! :)
Episode 14

.

Omg! Marcela is the worst kind of person. Like, be mad at Armando for treating you terrible all these years. Don't take your frustration out on Betty. She's defenseless and can't fight back. That's a terrible power play and I feel so bad for Betty. (Bc I've been in her shoes before)
Episode 15
.

.

Nico.

What happened to Nico at the bar is the tell-tell sign that you dont give large sums of money to people without financial planning experience. It hurt my heart to see him get used like that. :(. But also, I still feel very weird about him constantly ogling Patricia on IG. 

.

Hugo.

Omg! Can we kick him off the show? His dramatics is so freaking annoying. Have him sign a contract so if he threatens to quit he owes money or something so he can stop. It's not even funny. He literally has no reason to act the way he is acting. Surely they can find a better, less hostile designer in New York. I mean, that's where they shoot project runway!! (Obvi this is fiction but still my gah, I'm tired of seeing his character.)

.

Marce.

Omg!!! Hope insecure can Marcela get. Ugh! I don't like her much either. Like, throwing his phone away then getting upset when things go wrong!? I really hope Armando find out, I need him to find out. He's not a good guy but Marcela is worse. Never work with your romantic partners... It's to hard to seperate work from pleasure as seen here. :/
Episode 33.

.
.

🤦🏾‍♀️
No me digas..... Betty just ripped up the paper Armando gave her incriminating him. "I trust Señor Armando completely." *Big, dumb Betty Grin*
Seriously.... How can someone so smart be so stupid?
(That was rhetorical... It dawned on me how sheltered and naive Betty and Nicolas are in the last episode when they hired that attorney.)
Episode 35.

.
.

Ines y Giovas and the clothes.

🤦🏾‍♀️ I don't know why but I cannot stand MacGuffins like the one about Ines and Giovas dropping the clothes in the lobby. It didn't even make sense. Why was Giovas even helping? Don't they have like a million workers working with Hugo? And this is the second time we've seen Ines mishandle the clothing on screen.. I don't think she's as good at her job as the show is making her out to be. 

.
 
TAKEOVER.

Seriously... I've said it before but I have to say it again.. Armando is not fit to run V&M or any company. Again, nepotism at work screwing everything over!

.

Armando + Betty.

Omg! FINALLY Armando defends Betty against her workplace abusers. 😬 It's getting so annoying seeing her blamed for Armando inabilities.
(Gotta be honest, I didn't know the show was so long. I thought it was going to be like American seasons! 😅)

EPISODE 36.

.

Hugo's Collection.

Gotta be honest.. I didn't like it. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Everything was kind of meh excpet for the final showstopper outfit. That dress was georgeous! 😍

.

Efrain & Jenny.

Just. Gross. I can't stand weak men like that and I can't stand manipulative women like her. (Or vice versa gender..). Sophia better lawyer up!

.

Betty.

Seriously.. did Betty think Armando was going to pull her up on stage fqor the fashion show? Seriously? smh. Poor Betty... She really needs a reality check.

.

Patricia.

GOT EVERYTHING SHE DESERVED! straight rejection from both doods! (But I don't think Daniel can fire her for that?)

.

Daniel.

As an executive I believe Daniel has an fiduciary duty of loyalty. It's so irksome he is actively trying to destroy the company. Where are V&Ms lawyers!! (I'm in law school and his continuous actions are particularly troublesome to me.)

.

Hugo.

WTF man! Are you serious? He found Betty just to insult her. She wasn't even doing anything. That's abuse needs to stop. It's so tiring. She just doesn't deserve it no matter how bad the dress actually was. 
He needs a firm talking to, then he needs to get fired. NY has plenty of designers.
Episode 37

.

The Squad.

Omg...... I cant stand the way they gossip. They can't help but speak loud enough for EVERYONE to hear. 🤦🏾‍♀️

 .

Patricia.

Her voice ... Owe sometimes. Def in this episode. 🙉

.

Armando and "the insurance company".

There is no way he can sell the company to another company without telling the shareholders or executive or board members. I am certain that's illegal.

.

Bertha.

Omg.. who the eff interrupts an important meeting for flowers and then goes on and on Infront of the boss and important company. That was so annoying :/
Also, the Squad is hilarious... They never work and always concentrate in the most awkward way. I can't imagine they've all kept their job for this long.
EPISODE 17.

.



AURA MARIA.

omg! I know she's a member of the Squad and they are supposed to be the "good ones" but she is terrible! The way she treats Giovas is not nice. Toying with him bc she knows he likes her. Ugh!!
EPISODE 40.

.

Betty's Tarot Reading.

So she asked for a private reading yet her and the entire squad did the reading in the break room? Being all loud and stuff, literally the entire floor heard. 🤦🏾‍♀️

.

Wilson and Sandra.

OMG! that boxing scene between those two was hilarious. I really like them, I hope something happens (only bc Sandra seems to want him too.)

.

Patricia's Accent.

Patty-cakes sounds like she has a different accent than everyone else. Especially in the way she say her vowels. I've always thought it but it didn't really dawn on me until after hearing Marce say "un lecho de amor" the Patri said "un lecho de horror". 

.

Betty + Armando.

I don't know... Betty and Armando have good chemistry but I just can't ship these two. (Especially bc the age difference, but also bc .. I don't see it 🤷🏾‍♀️) they work as co-workers. They don't have any mutual interest outside of V&M and BAR. I won't how the show is going to twist that then.
EPISODE 41

Papa Demi.

Omg! He's the reason I could never live with my parents. Pack me like a sardine with roommates. It's no wonder she is some of the way she is. I know parents like this and thier children have a had time growing up. :Sigh: poor Betty. 

.

Armando & Marcela.

I don't like Marcela but Armando is terrible to her. She should leave him, she can do better. What did he think Marcela would think with him not answering, or coming home late or being piss ass drunk. He's stupid, right? I just don't understand. How can he keep her in the dark so much. Besides being together, they should be friends, right? It just makes no sense...
off topic: 3 members - 3 online :'D I find it so funny :P also... wasn't there a 4th member?
Episode 18.

..

.
Me Smith, HR.
OMG! lol! Mr. Smith's acting is the absolute worst on the show! Especially when he speak English.
Episode 29.

.
.

Artificial Insemination.

Omg! $10k for artificial insemination! 😱 It only coast me a little under $4k to do and I most of that was the back to back plane tickets. I'm so glad I did what I did and didn't go through the US health system

.

Giovas.

I know I sort of defended him earlier but ewe~! He is so gross. :/.

.

Sandra y Wilson. 

I their date was in so 28 but I find this relationship so cute. I identify with Sandra in some ways. I hope Wilson isn't a jerk to her in the end. Literally their storyline is the only side storyline I care about.

.

Patty-cakes.

Is just the worst, verdad? Like... I can't believe she's survived this long. Seriously, what does Marce ser in her?
Episode 38

.

Betty's getting her Grove back

It's about time she asked someone to help her create her personal style! Omg! If I worked for a fashion place I would be like "hello, doll me up darling!" I paused the episode so I can't wait to see he reveal!

.

Jenny / Efrain / Sophia

I am so happy Marcela told her to call the lawyer. IDK how much money Efrain put into it, he doesn't have a right to sell her out of her family home. Idk NY State law but that seemed like it was her asset before him so he shouldn't be able to force her. Idk, it's bitchy. BUT WHAT'S WORST! ~ Jenny giving her papers. So freaking rude. She has no redeeming qualities. Again, I'm glad Marce and Ines put her in her place!

.

Sophia y Charly

YESSSSS!!!! 

But omg, please tell me the translation of:
"Bump Uglies" "Horizontal Mambo" and "Pound Town" were correct bc I need to know how to say this! 😆😂🤣
Episode 39

.

NICOLAS.
Omg! He's hilarious in this episode. I was literally cracking up at every joke he was making with Armando and Ricardo.  // "Would you like about drink?" -Armie "You're trying to take advantage of me?" Awkward laugh - Nico. Just gold. That actor has great comedic timing. I hope he gets more roles in the future.

.

BETTY.
Omg... It would honestly have been easier to just tell Armando that Nicolas is her bff and that she only told the Squad he was her bf bc they were grilling her. She is digging in this hole of a lie and it's just weird...? Also, Ricardo needs to get a grip.. he's one of the main reasons they are in this mess!
Episode 42

.

The Infamous Kiss.


Am I the only one who wished the kiss between Amando and Betty was a fantasy?

.

Riccardo's leering eyes.


Omg... Are we really going to ship Riccardo and Armando? Now it feels like Ricky is pushing Armando on Betty just so he can sleep with Marce (Who has a rocking body by the way!)

.

Betty.


I really hope Betty learned from this experience and shows some character growth. 

.

Armando.

.

He either likes Betty (which I'm still weirded out by) or he wants to be caught and this notion that he's "Manhattan's Playboy" is absolute lie. He has no chill.
EPISODE 44

.

Sophia.


OMG SOPHIA! have you not learned? Don't - Engage!!
Legit, I get it. But don't engage. She looks so immature trying to fight Efrain and Jenny. She needs counseling or anger management classes. As soon as he walked in the door with Jenny I would have said "Leave" and when they didn't I would walk into the other room and call my lawyer. Literally has a situation like this happen but my ex was decent enough not to bring his young gf in the house. :/ Efrain is major scum. CALL YOUR FREAKING ATTORNEY SOPHIA!! that's what you are (not) paying her for! Ugh~~~~~ (had to get this rant out. lol. It was boiling me all episode)

BERTHA: seriously? Depp down Efrain want stop be near Sophia? 😑 Even *if* that were true, Sophia shouldn't want Efrain to be near her or the kids. He's a bad person and he is not the kind of person her kids she look up to at all.

.

Patricia.

Omg! She makes what, $6-7k a month right? How is she "so broke"? I know NY is expensive but she is taking in $72-84k a year... There is no way she cannot easily live off that. Can I have her freaking job please? Where are my right friends hooking me up! 😭 Someone take pity on me, esta porbecita! 😭
EPISODE 49

.

The Squad.

OMG! They are so annoying. First Sophia blabbed that Betty's lunch was from her "bf" as if it was a secret she was allowed to tell. It wasn't. That's not friendship, that's rude. Then they went on and on despite Betty's protest to taunt Patricia... It's just rude. I wouldn't be friends with them after that lunch. Miss me "peloton" with you gossip BS!

.

Marcela's unprofessional jealousy.

Sue. Sue. Sue. Workplace harrasment. 
Sue and walk way. No one needs this. 
:/ And I'm tired of seeing it. Marcela is such a one dimensional character.
Episode 50

.

Armando's face.

Am I the only one who notices the faces Armando makes are "tan raro"?? 🤔 Like, It always takes me out the scene bc everyone else is a bit more normal. Even Betty in some ways. Haha which is hilarious to say when Betty is the awkward one. But the way how eyes enlarge or his mouth ovals when he's frustrated or when he fidgits his fingers... It's so weird, right?

.

Armando.

Also, why is Armando going out with Betty every evening? Like, does he even like Marcela anymore? he makes no sense. He has no business, romantic or strategy. No street smarts. So far no actual smarts.🤷🏾‍♀️ I don't get why "all the women want him."
EPISODE 4

Current thoughts:

So far, it seems they are sticking relatively close to the original script. With it being made in 2019, with the introduction of technology and social media, I would have hoped it would've been updated in some aspects. So far, they give a reason for Betty sticking out a horrible job (her dad needs money), which wasn't present in the original.

THEME SONG: I liked that they kept the original theme song. They have updated the sound to be more rap-like, which is ok. I do like Betty saying "Whatever" a lot at the end. That's cute.

FREDDY: Or the absence thereof. I really liked Freddy. He was witty, funny, and always singing and happy. Wilson was like his sidekick. So I'm hoping that as the show progresses, Wilson basically is himself and Freddy combined (in personality traits). I'm really missing that aspect right now.

BETTY: I like that she talks normal most of the time, and just squeaky awkward when she seems nervous. It makes more sense. The original Betty was screechy 24/7.

ARMANDO: I am not connecting to his character at all. He's supposed to be the man a lot of women throw themselves at, but I'm not buying it.

PATRICIA (PATSY-PAT, PATY): Am I the only one who thinks she looks like Anna Kendrick? lol
Is it normal that I don't get any notifications about new comments? I sometimes forget to check the sub and when I do- boom! 15 new comments in this thread... anyway...

If Ricardo wasn't Armando's "friend", who would've been fired. His only job was to check the broker. He should take personal responsibility for what happened. 

Saaaame... Patricia doesn't have a kind bone in her body! She's nice to Marcela cause she's her personal ATM.
I found it really relatable actually. It felt to me like she had traits of being on the spectrum, social awkwardness, almost an inability to talk in certain situations, sensory issues. I dunno I just really liked this interpretation of Betty. 

It also looks like she’s super sheltered and maybe her mother buys all her clothes for her lol
Hey Aangita :D

I totally agree. I almost stopped watching because of the mannerism! Some of them are also over the top but Betty is just another level awkward. For a sec there I thought that maybe it's a telenovela thing that I just don't get, cause I'm used to European/American acting... and honestly I still don't know :P but you kinda get used to it with every episode and they show you that Betty can also be subtle :) Don't know how many other versions of the show you've seen, but I think it's a common theme - taking someone who needs new hairdo and a wardrobe prepared by someone with better eye for colours and patterns and boom! pretty girl
Also, Glitter, when did you finish the series?
Wilson is one handsome man indeed :D

It's hard to answer your questions without spoiling the show :'D
Efrain is a piece of shit... IMO of course... and that whole plot is hard to watch...

Yes! Exactly! He feels safe with Betty and he knows she won't judge him. She will tell him her opinion but won't judge. I feel like he knows he can't get that from Marcela.
Hugo is definitely more annoying than entertaining. The way he speaks to Betty makes me sick. I'm honestly shocked that he doesn't get in any HR trouble for that... like come on! If she was calling him a 'bald gnome' she would be fired. 

P.S. I love the episode thing you're doing :) it gives the convo a structre and lets us comment on a particular behaviour :)
Honestly... being in love doesn't justify ripping the paper. She can trust him completely and hide the document and never use it, but why rip it? It doesn't make sense.
I know that this is a year old, but I am on this episode. And I can't take this fake pregnancy storyline. Hugo is completely awful. Betty has interesting taste in formal wear, but he was so rude. (I deleted my comment on episode 35 because I didn't realize it was actually epsidoe 36.)
What I liked about the squad was that they immediately invited Betty to sit with them at lunch, and just immediately accepted her. In the original series, it took a few days for them to extend an invite to her because they didn't want her looks to make them look bad, but they eventually came around.
I guess they do the job when we aren't watching :'D hahaha :'D but I get what you mean
As people watch it they'll come here and see all the chatter! Haha
The only reason he hasn't been fire is him being the head of HR. He's a sleazy guy...
Regarding his faces:

I at a point realized that too and was wondering if he did those things from the beginning or if he adapted those 'cringy' things from Betty because I had the feeling those faces and gestures were getting more and more. :'D
Patty Cakes -- Hah! She does look a little like Anna Kendrick! I'm not a fan of her character. They seem too have made her mean for the sake of being mean. Is she like that in the original.

Betty -- omg I cannot imagine Betty speaking as "Awkward Betty" the entire time. Some episodes when she has more nervous moments are so difficult for me to watch. I'm really interested in watching the Colombian one now... But I'll wait again until I understand Spanish more. 

Armando -- agree with you 100%. Honestly, he seems more awkward than Betty sometimes haha!

Theme Song -- it's very catchy for sure! 😆

2019 -- my main issue with the fact that they don't utilize tech is Betty's wardrobe and hair..there are so many people sharing how to deal with curly hair or be "authentically you" in fashion without trying to conform to the fashion of V&M. (But that's just me)
But no one in her family dresses like that. They are all out together. I think it would make sense if they all looked a mess. lol

And yeah, I think some of her awkwardness could be potentially bc of the spectrum but like, who hops around like a mouse say "Sorry~ oh, sorry" so awkward. 

I'm anxious, have always been told I'm ugly (well not attractive) and (only up until recently) was extremely socially awkward.. but she is next level! 

😅 "But this is a telenovela, after all~~" #JanetheVirgin
I've seen a few other versions. Also, I'm used to telenovelas, I've seen several but her acting is on another level of awkwardness. 😅 "Ugly Betty" (the early 2000s), Betty wasn't ugly as much as she wasn't glamarous. Especially in the fashion world. Beatriz~ she's just unkempt. It makes no sense. Her neighbor friend, he could be considered "ugly" but at least he doesn't look unkempt. I need them to work on that.

And OMG! Can we talk about the father? Like what's his deal? 🤔 Who acts like that~? For me, even for a telenovelas~ he seems over the top.
I finished my "BettyxArmando" watch about three weeks ago and now I'm on episode 83 I think :)
I cannot wait for Efrain to be put in his place. Why he thinks his young gf will be with him forever is so funny to me. Why he can't tell she is using him idk! When she finally dumps him and he realizes what he's lost (on top of the respect of his young children who won't forget this!) It will just be the cherry on top!
Omg yesssss! Like in no job can you speak to anyone like that. Seriously. He is literally insulting Betty on the daily. It's hard to watch. No one but the squad is nice to Betty but the ones that are mean to her are so shallow about it. I need people to at least give her credit for the work she has done. Hell, idk why Marcela can't see that without Betty, Armando would be lost

Edit:typos lol
Yeah! That storyline was bonkers but somehow, towards the end, Pati became a very fun character to watch. :)
I haven't seen "Yo soy Betty, La Fea" (is that the original one you're talking about? The Colombian one?) I've only seen the American "Ugly Betty". I am learning Spanish at the moment and I'm going to save the Méxican version for when I understand more.

But yes, I real liked how the Squad accepted her. Also, most of them are not even ugly.. desperate maybe, but not ugly!
They are also do loud in the office! There are no such thing as secrets with them. lol
:D it would be fun if someone joined the convo, but I'm not complaining :)

can I say that I also loved Rogelio :D and I think I'm the only one who didn't like Alba, cause she preached whilst doing the exact opposite herself... maybe it really is just me, but I would prefer her talking to her Xiomara and Jane about her mistakes... especially because it didn't safe Xiomara from making them anyway :/ I know it's not Jane the virgin sub but I had to get it off my chest :)
He is so sleazy. Who knows how many other employees he's "taken out" with threat of their job. :/
I haven't rewatched it to find out... And even tho it was a great boost for my Spanish, it was so hard to get through the first time. 

*If* Armando adopted those mannerisms or exaggerated them more after becoming more involved with Betty then that makes even less sense because he's pushed as this ladies man. A real "ladies man" wouldn't just become a sponge of the person he's dating.

I really liked the Selma Hayek/America Ferrera version of Ugly Betty. That Daniel was aloof business wise but in all other aspects he made sense. And he became sensitive but not a complete "nerd" after meeting Betty. I haven't watched the Mexico version (with the very yummy Jaime Camil!) But it's next on my list when I have time. I'm curious how much machismo that character displays and how it changes with that version of a Betty. 

I hope your enjoying the show! It was fun leaving my comments even tho it seemed like it was only me watching. :)
Patty is definitely mean in the original. Very "better than thou" attitude.

Betty: Here is a short clip of her talking to her best friend Nicolas, with whom she feels comfortable with. This is about how she talks throughout the show. [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UELO9_SbOc)

Armando does seem awkward. In the original he's a tyrant of the boss, always yelling and screaming at people (and is very believable). The Armando in this new version isn't very convincing.

And that's true. They should've shown her looking at magazines or blogs online, and maybe her dad doesn't approve of her doing any kind of makeup or cool clothes or something. And the fact that they're poor doesn't help (so she can't buy her own clothes). Or something.
When I first started watching the show, and I saw her attire, instantly I thought her clothes were hand-me-downs. Like they were her grandmas clothes or something haha. But yeah I guess her family members don’t really dress that way. It just overall looked like the clothes that overly protective parents would get for their daughter lol 

Yeah her awkwardness is next level for sure 

Oh man Jane the Virgin. I just want to say, Janes dad in the show played by Jaime Camil, also played Fernando in La fea más Bella which is another take on the Ugly Betty universe. And it’s currently my latest obsession. Jaime is the best.
I feel like with Beatriz the appearance thing that bothers me the most is her moustache. To be honest I see it as my problem, cause she should be able to have if it's not a problem for her, and I think it just shows my insecurity considering body hair :'D but that's another story :P

Well... my grandpa is a lot like Betty's father, so I guess that answers your last question :'D I want to say more but I don't want to spoil anything :)
I'm sure he's not depicting every middle-aged man... but I can imagine there are many who would do literally everything just to bang a young chick  ... I'm rolling my eyes every time he's on the screen
Omg :'D the believe that every skill required to run a company is genetic (?) is beyond me :P cause I really think Marcela is convinced Armando can do it because his father was good at it.
lol! Definitely desperate, but not ugly, I agree. Yes, the original Betty is the Colombia one. What I didn't like about Ugly Betty is that they couldn't incorporate the Spanglish talk. The original Mr. Smith loved to speak English (and everyone would get mad at him and tell him to stop talking in English). But they always had a word here and there in English, and those little "jajas" (hahas, 'laughs') just didn't translate and make it into the English version.

I'm Mexican and grew up watching telenovelas with my mom. I watched the original Betty when it first came out on tv. I never got to see the ending, so I'm actually rewatching it right now. I'm almost done, but I realized that what I used to think was funny, is now cringy, as a lot of it leans more on harassment and abuse. But that's the adult in me talking, lol.
Thank you for your answer! I strangely didn't get a notification haha
Yeah, you're right. That wouldn't suit a womanizer but it made him imo more likable. 
I haven't watched any other versions. That was the first one but I think I am also gonna watch the America Ferrera version when I have the time. So I'll be looking forward to your comments and thoughts. I enjoyed reading them alooot tbh.
I have also already finished Betty en NY. I really loved it and still am sad that it ended. :D
I know this is old, but I was watching the series recently and i think that it makes sense for him to become more quirky. First because he was trying to do whatever he felt Betty would like. And second because he becomes more relaxed around her. Also it is common for partners in a relationship to take on mannerisms and phrases from the other half of the relationship. Since you like this other person, you are more inclined to imitate them some. This is like a real life thing, not sure if they incorporated it on purpose or if just happened. But as he loves her, it makes sense that he adopts certain things she does.

This Armando I don't think is that much of a ladies man to begin with, I think it is more like he is considered attractive and he is obviously open to women approaching him, so they do. He barely does any work. Beyond obvious lies, like he would marry the women he is trying to get with. I say this, because I think on other versions of the series he is more of a ladies man.

Betty is the first woman he had to work to get. And also he felt like he didn't have to play the cool character or anything with her. He many times tells her that he feels he can be himself with her. To be honest he is quite the manchild, which also makes sense considering the age difference. If he wasn't that childish, I think it would feel very creepy for him to be with her, when she is obviously also very childish and specially young. This is the first time he fell in love, so the first time he changes because of the person he loves.

It is a bit annoying, because i dont like the trope of a woman saving a guy or making him better, but the truth is that his relationship with Betty makes him grow. Up until then he doesn't really care at all about what his girlfriends felt. Everything was more about fulfilling his own desires. And when he grew he stopped caring so much about what other people thought of him and was more free. And deep inside he was quirky after all xD so he left his cool persona a bit.

Anyways that is my reading on why he changed the way he behaves.
Omg! That clip looks so inviting, I want to watch it. Haha! And that Betty looks much better than Betty en NY.. like she's not wearing fashionable clothing bit she's doesn't look homeless. Her hair is brushed and nice, just not fancy. And this is from over a decade ago, right? There is just NO WAY in this age Betty en NY can't do better. I need to see the reveal so I can laugh at them taking off her glasses and her magically being beautiful! (I wished that happened to me when I take off my glasses. 🤭)

And you're right. Her dad is so controlling, I could totally see him telling her to cover up from head to toe. She wears dark tights under a long dress with a sweater almost everyday. Her skin has probably never seen an ounce of sun. lol
🤔 maybe she wears clothes like that as a way to sheild herself bc she's so uncomfortable in her body. In middle school I went from no boobs to B/C and wore a jacket all year. I just figured, she's what, around 24, she would wear more flattering clothing that don't look like they were rolled in mud. Idk! I guess it will make the transformation more remarkable! 

Jaime Camil is my main man-crush! I love Rogelio! I haven't watched La fea más Bella.. i want to get to the point where I don't need subtitles to watch that one. 😙
Really? He just seems like such a far fetched character..  I honestly just want them to wrap up his c-storyline 😅

And that lawyer... Omg 🤦🏾‍♀️ ... Classic shady attorney.. I'm in law school and it just makes me giggle
She's obviously under the guise of rose colored glasses-love for Armando... And that's because she wants to be supportive but at the same time she's not because she doesn't ever seen to support his plans. 🤷🏾‍♀️ She makes it seem like she only cares if he loves her, who cares about the well-being of the company! I'm still mad she threw his phone away AND didn't answer when Betty texted BUT screamed at Betty when she returned to V&M!!

And Daniel's "twists and turns" to destroy the company... It's all too coincidental~ Macela is literally the MOST BLIND VP that company has.
Brah! Betty en NY has so many cringe moments and it was made in 2019. Sometimes it's hard to watch. Especially when Betty is getting verbally abused. 

Mr. Smith's English in this version is hilarious to me! I honestly wished he would only speak Spanish. 

I didn't grow up watching telenovelas but I understand the genre. (my (ex) in-laws are Mexican.) I used to watch Camila when I was in HS with my ex-boyfriend. He use to translate for me over the phone.😅
Oh! Well if you want to chat about it when you watch America Ferrera's version, 
I'm down! :) 

Have you seen Jane the Virgin? It's a very fun American Telenovela too
I guess in my experience, it never bodes well for someone to change their entire personality once they are with someone. This is a tv show, however, and the trope you described of "I wasn't able to be myself until I met you" is quite common (especially women for men).

We won't even discuss the age difference, bc, barf- but if going by your assessment then I suppose his character arc into slightly zany, immaturity makes sense.

Thanks for coming in and chatting tho! I wish more people watched and commented on Reddit bc I had so many feelings watching it! lol

Enjoy the rest of the show! :)
I think that is a really good point. And it will make more sense later on (don’t want to spoil anything) But I will say as a chick on the spectrum, I have absolutely no fashion sense. I think Betty dresses better than me lmao. Some of her outfits are kinda cute. And I love her boots. But yeah Some people just never really figure it out. I’m always in jeans and teeshirt haha

Omg another Jaime fan. He is just amazing. I have a huge crush on this dude. 
I struggle with Spanish as well. Sadly I couldn’t find anything with subs for la fea más bella. So I sort of just jumped into it. I can sort of understand what’s going on. And I’m catching on a little more as I go.
I know! If somone told me that people like my grandad exist I wouldn't believe them :'D 

The lawyer may be THE WORST character in the show. I know he's not even a secondary character, so we know very little about him, but he's not evil-smart he's just stupid and hungry for money. I hate him so much.
I was about to post some more thoughts, but realized we're on the thread about the squad...let me create one about Episode 4, because I just finished that episode and have no where to post about it, lol.
Thank you, I will do that for sure! :)

No, but I heard it's reallyyyy good and therefore also on my long to-watch-list :'D
I agree with you. You have to give in a bit with the suspension of disbelief. But I think he was quirky from the beginning, he just little by little let loose more and more.

In the original series the age difference was like 6 years,   Armando being younger so his irresponsibility makes a bit more sense. And also she looked more mature, so it wasn't really creepy. With this version Betty looks so young and acts so childish that is really creepy to me.

What I like of this show and it's variations, specially the original one, is that it really doesn't have a fairy tale ending. Like you can't be 100% sure things will work out. In soap operas in general they like to overdo the endings. I think in bettt in NY they are leaning towards the fairy tale ending more, closing all loose ends.

To be honest, even if he changed, it is not healthy for her to chose him. There was a major breach of trust, and he says he changed, but he also said soo many things. I see Betty accepting him more like a regression. She still wants to believe, she doesn't want to feel it was all for naught. Which is an all too common human behavior.

I like this series, is very well done, specially the original. It is sometimes over the top, but at the same time characters behave in ways that may seem illogical but that actually make sense considering their lives and shortcomings. I think in that sense the original is better though.
Lmao yes the lawyers. Both of them... so dumb. They crack me up. Don’t want to spoil anything either but I was constantly trying to shoo them off the screen.
I'm not halfway yet but would love to chat if you want. Honestly... 😬 Betty and her dad are pissing me off lol
IACGlitter~ omg! I'm finally on EPISODE 40 (I am assuming halfway through?) And I think I'm at the episode where your real dislike for Bertha stems from. :/ She's just unbearable~!
Love to hear your thoughts :) Do you want to do it here? In case someone wants to read it :'D or privately?
whole series has 123 episodes... or something around that number :) 

basically if you're not good with hiding that you don't want to share something (I think Sandra is good at it), she'll get you :'D
We can do it here, it's all good. I just finished episode 4

You want to start a new thread to discuss? Or park it there since there's no one in this sub 😭

I read your other post as based on what I've seen I can see myself cringing bc of the direction it looks like they are taking the show. But I'm also watching it porque aprendiendo español sooooooo i'll watch all of it, even if it angers me.
Yes!! I feel like Sandra never shared anything but she's really bad at spreading. I honestly love her storyline and wouldn't mind a spin off of her.
As you said... there's literally no one here :P except the moderator (Hello to you! :)), so we can do it however you want to do it :) 

I wasn't planning on learning Spanish but I picked up a few words anyway and I think they show what Betty is about :'D trabajo, perdoname and  tranquila :'D this show in a nutshell :'D
lol! Ok, I'm going to start an official show discussion thread with a spoiler alert in the title for future ppl who watch and want to rant. 🙃
I’m always down to discuss this show!
I'm just rewatching Betty en NY 🥳
It's kinda sad that the show is hardly discussed online and that this sub is so empty...
I'm watching episode 3 and honestly I'm quite furious~!
Should I make a new post with something I want to discuss, so others can join if they want to? :) P.S. Is there another Betty sub that I'm not aware of or people just don't want to talk about it on Reddit? :P
True. But! I'm still here if you want to share some thoughts :) hope I remember enough to discuss.
I started rewatching it a few weeks ago and I'm halfway through on EP 75 right now. I didn't care much for it the first time I watched it a few years ago, and so far my feelings haven't changed. There's not a single character I care for and this Betty is just insufferable with the constant crying and quivering and acting dumb. Also, she is very hard to look at but in a bad way lol. If anything, Sandra and Wilson's story has been the most enjoyable part IMO 

Prior to starting watching I rewatched the original Yo Soy Betty La Fea, which I've binged watched more times that I'd like to admit in the past 20+ years lol, and I enjoyed it just like the very first time. The original version is just brilliant in every sense, the comedy, the acting, the cleverly written dialogues, the story arches, definitely one of the best shows ever.
To be honest, after 3 episodes I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue at all... and then I did something some may consider awful - I watched ONLY Betty and Armando scenes by skipping through the rest. When I was sure I like their chemistry, I decided to start again to get a better look at all the other characters.
Feel free to post a new topic. Maybe it will some how attract new people. 

I looked all over and couldn’t find anything for Betty en ny. But maybe there is another sub for the entire Betty multiverse lol all the different versions of ugly Betty. If there is let me know!
I couldn't find any multiverse subs and the one for Ugly Betty (US) has like 600 memebers o.0 what is going on?! o.0
I was just discussing this one someone yesterday. How is this fandom so small. All the different versions spawned from ysblf are amazing. Where are the fans lmao
On facebook? :P I have no idea :'D I'm shocked by the US sub though. After all Reddit is mainly inhabited by Americans.
