Binged the show tonight and here are my thoughts.  

1.  Lots of pretty explicit sex scenes.  Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs pretty freaking hot.  

2.  The full frontal in episode 3(?) was SHOCKING!  Like wow! üò≥üçÜüëÄ. I had to rewind and rewatch it because it blew my mind. 

3.  Both Cooper and Brad are complete assholes.  The emotional abuse and gaslighting that Billie suffered at the hands of both of those shitheads was the hardest part to watch.  It was painful.  Neither of them deserve her.  

4. My favorite character is definitely Sasha.  Love her feminist-y badass character. Although she did majorly break friend code by sleeping with Billie‚Äôs ex and lying about it.  That was super cringe. 

5. There was a lot of crying.  Billie needs to stand up for herself more and put those two shitheads in their place.  

6. Why are the next steps after realizing your wife isn‚Äôt satisfied sexually by you to get pissed, hate fuck her, take zero responsibility and blame her, consider cheating on her, and then actually cheat on her?  Like Cooper is just awful.  I hope she divorces that guy fr.

7.  Looks like Season 2 is heading towards an open marriage and I‚Äôm ok with it.  It‚Äôs probably the best for everyone. 

8.  Why are the other wives such stepford caricatures?  Is that a Connecticut thing?  Is it real?  That‚Äôs a lot of entitled white lady energy there. 

9.  I was not a fan of the casting of the little kid.  A little towhead boy just didn‚Äôt seem to fit with two dark-haired parents for me.  I think they could have done better there.  

10.  Objectively, the story is kind of bad.  This is basically the stuff of trashy romance novels.  It was an entertaining binge on a Saturday night but it‚Äôs not winning any awards.  


My two cents and that isn‚Äôt worth much. üò¨

While it‚Äôs no excuse for Billie, postpartum depression affects people in so many ways. That‚Äôs the main thing I took away from the whole show. She‚Äôs not mentally okay. Depression can really make you do crazy things. It‚Äôs pretty normal for moms to be selfish, emotional, euphoric, and unstable during the first year after a baby.
I am fuming. Billie is one of the most frustrating characters I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of watching (definitely up there with Ginny). She is sooooo nauseatingly self-centered. Episode 6 for example, how can you disappear into the city and not tell anyone where you are or when you‚Äôll be back? You leave your kids and gallivant with your ex boyfriend to find out ‚Äúwhat changed him‚Äù? Why does it even matter. Once you found out what changed him what difference was it supposed to make to your life? I get that Billie is a person and she needs to have her own thing going besides being a mother and a wife but I can‚Äôt excuse her behaviour because she doesn‚Äôt think of anyone but herself. She chose this for herself and instead of accepting that and trying to get professional help she has decided to gaslight her husband and carry on a boarderline affair with her extremely toxic ex. 

To be honest she acts how I did when I was 19, constantly running back to a guy who would treat me like shit then tell me he loved me so I would run back. The difference between me and billie though is that I didn‚Äôt have no damn kids or a husband so, if I decided to run back to my aint shit ex, I was the only person getting hurt. It‚Äôs genuinely pathetic what she has going on  

I hope Cooper leaves her and takes her kids so she can be with Brad and get the karma she deserves.

And don‚Äôt get me started on the fucking tears.
This show was pretty bad, and I‚Äôm not invested enough to have arguments on here, but the hate for Cooper is kinda dumb in my opinion.

He has faults, sure. Everyone keeps pointing to him being ‚Äúbad at sex‚Äù, but I think the bigger take away was he wasn‚Äôt giving his wife the attention she was in need of, and this can be really normal for a long term relationship. Life can get monotonous, routines develop and sometimes partners can forget to be outwardly romantic when you‚Äôre balancing work, kids, home life, etc. That was Cooper‚Äôs biggest drawback to enter the show, and it leads her to fantasize about her ex boyfriend rather than talk to him about it? That was my first issue.

The biggest issue I have on the hate to him is all of the weird and fucked shit he did was in direct response to actions Billie took. Beating off to her journal and getting the blowjob at the swingers party was fucked on his part, but this was all direct results from the situations Billie put him into (more so the swingers party than the journal). He tried to change himself into some kind of sex god so that he could live up to this fantasy that Billie created out of Brad, and you could tell that Cooper was going through emotional torture being the byproduct of Billie‚Äôs indecisiveness.

I honestly would have felt more sympathy for Billie if she would have made her intentions, feelings and struggles clear sooner. It‚Äôs like she couldn‚Äôt come to terms with the fact that she just wanted a slice of a big Aussie hog, and kept dragging Cooper along for the ride.

I think all of these characters were pretty fucking poorly written, but for Cooper to get more hate than Brad is kinda trash. Brad fucking with Cooper during the dinner scene and actively meddling in a married woman‚Äôs life is fucked beyond belief. Billie sucks, Brad sucks, Cooper sucks and this show sucks honestly. But for trash TV, it was worth it I guess.

Also fuck Sasha, what a best friend, fucking around with your BFF‚Äôs ex who shared a miscarriage and tough, tough breakup. Even if Billie said it was okay (to try to keep him off of the market for her), that was super fucked up in retrospect once you know how far Billie and Brad‚Äôs relationship really went.
I legitimately cannot understand how her marriage is disintegrating because she had sexual fantasies about an ex and wrote them down. Cooper shouldn‚Äôt have been reading her journal in the first place, but then again she was stupid to KEEP writing about it at all.

It really frustrated me that she asked him to simply talk to her multiple times and he refused. I completely understand that his ego was severely damaged by this point, but if he sincerely wanted to save their marriage I think he should have at least considered a conversation. 

She never cheated on him, and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt even consider the fantasies an emotional affair. Everyone has fantasies and it‚Äôs completely unfair that he held that against her.
Couple things that bothered me and made me think:
1. In conversation with his male friend/colleague, Cooper implies he can‚Äôt do particular sexual things to the mother of his children. Can anyone share their opinion or personal experiences?

2. There are couple times when B asks Cooper to slow down, change direction etc, he gets frustrated and doesn‚Äôt care if she is satisfied or not. I believe there are men like that - even if their partner tells them what the issue is or how they like it, they wouldn‚Äôt take their time and patience to satisfy them.

3. B. may represent a privileged SAHM who is going thru PPD but don‚Äôt you almost have a PhD in psychology? And Sasha, her friend, wouldn‚Äôt she assess her professionally and prevent the crisis from worsening?
I see a lot of comments from other wives saying that they feel the same way as Billy. I do too. I'm 41 and I've been married for 18 years and my husband doesn't put in any effort at all. He doesn't do anything romantic and if I complain about it he'll buy some flowers and be like "There are you happy?" He's SO freakin' boring and having sex with him is monotonous and dull. Sometimes I think about my ex and what it might've been like if I had stayed with him. It's very common to wonder about the path not taken. My husband completely takes me for granted and if he really loves me he sure doesn't put out any effort to show it. For those that are condemning Billy they don't understand what it's like to be trapped in an unhappy marriage with no passion.
My two cents on Billie she is selfish putting her needs first before her to kids and husband. She keeps going back to the ex boyfriend Brad. That broke your heart on numerous occasions. He throws you out of his apartment. you tell Brad that you may be pregnant he looks at you with a Stone cold face what are you gonna do with it you don‚Äôt want it I don‚Äôt it. Your husband tries to do everything to please you by going to swingers party to spice up you sex Life. what do you you stop it and say this is not us. Billie your willing to have sex with your ex-boyfriend Brad in a public bathroom public train station. Public back alley. and fantasize about him playing with you on a couch in a public restaurant.  If there is a season two. I hope they do not turn her husband Cooper in to a crybabies I love you I want you back I forgive you. Hope to God he send her packing. and be with Francesca.

I just got to say...for someone with a degree in PSYCHOLOGY, she dumb as HELL. I‚Äôm so glad ppl agree that she‚Äôs just so extremely, poorly written and it‚Äôs not just me SCREAMING. There was no one to root but Hudson. Hoping he makes it out of this shit show without emotional scarring.
Episode 7 is the worst episode of a show I‚Äôve ever seen. There‚Äôs a whole ass swingers party. He cheats on his wife in front of her with his coworkers wife and then punches out the coworker??? What am I watching? Then Brad throws her out of his apartment after cheating on her ????
Who the hell this Brad guy thinks he is? Face timing Billie showing her his dong and expecting she'll do what? Why is this world so effed up. Yuck.
I‚Äôm team Brad. Cooper is a freaking psycho CURRENTLY. And Brad maybe used to be, but he‚Äôs changed!
Cooper did make a lot of mistakes and was a asshole for most of the season honestly shouldn‚Äôt be with either of them but to act like everything was fine after the up and down and to cheat anyway was a complete waste of time. She should‚Äôve just left Cooper to begin with dude is not the best but neither is she trying to keep both guys.
Why is Hudson a lil creepy. Why does Toronto always have to b New York. If you can‚Äôt afford to film in New York just make the setting be Toronto. Why is he FaceTiming without consent. Why is the acting and script so hammy and bad?! Why did she ruin a good Mac. Why can‚Äôt she hand write a normal journal. Why can‚Äôt they communicate like adults. Why did Paige from degrassi make her stay the whole day. I have many questions ü•≤
I now in late to the party but I just finished the series and‚Ä¶ holy crap. They all suck. Brad sucks. Billie sucks so bad. I was on coopers side until that party and boy, he sucks too. This show is trash. And yet I watched the whole thing and will probably watch a season 2 if they make one
[deleted]
The most unrealistic part of this cringy (and yet I can‚Äôt stop watching it) show? 

How often the men voluntarily go down on women. Especially since they‚Äôre supposed to be what, mid to late 20‚Äôs in the flashbacks? Give me a break! Lol! The episode where Billie‚Äôs friend is giving the band guy a blowjob, and he stops in the middle and says something like, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a goddess, let me worship you‚Äù and stops his bj to go down on her‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.sure, Jan.
Does anyone else think it‚Äôs incredibly selfish and presumptuous that Billie goes to a man that just professed his undying love and proposed to her and saying, ok let‚Äôs fuck but we still won‚Äôt have any kind of relationship and thinking he‚Äôd be ok with it? I could easily see the opening of season two being Brad throwing her out.
Boy‚Ä¶ Billie really pissed me off
She belongs to the streets.
Did anyone get frustrated by the general plotline surrounding her journal?  

1. Her journal is a Microsoft Word unencrypted doc on a shared laptop with her husband. She does not even bother to exit the document before closing the lid of her laptop. If it's a personal document you don't want read by your husband, why not encrypt it with a password?! Or at least save and close before putting your computer away? If he asks why she password protected it, I feel like it's fine to say "It's my journal and my personal thoughts, and I would like to keep it private." 
2. Instead of the obvious password encryption she could have done, she renames her document to "Thanksgiving Recipes". This is very dumb. You can just search files based on when they were saved. If that's the only file you've saved recently, chances are that's your journal!
3. Her writing style is very immature and childish. How did she manage to write a cover story in Psychology Today?
The ending SUCKS üò≠ Moreover, this show just proves ‚Äúnice guys finish last‚Äù. Everything got fixed and Billie just had to f things up again ü§¨ I feel SO bad for Coop. He deserves so much better. I don‚Äôt care if Cooper divorces Billie. She‚Äôs horrible
Why does Billie also look like she‚Äôs about to start crying in every scene. Every.scene.
He read his wife‚Äôs journal and that never came up as an issue. Drive me nuts.
Did anyone else feel like Billie needed to just move on from both of them? She would never be happy with either of them. She should just be alone, go back to work and focus on her kids. Therapy to help her move on and potentially meet someone else in the future when she is stronger and ready.
[deleted]
I don't get the part where she is at Hudson's play, decides during it that her marriage isn't enough then runs across Manhattan to start an affair with Brad but Cooper is back at home and tracking her whereabouts ü§îü§î like what was her excuse for leaving her family at that point of time lol. Why would Cooper let her.. So strange. 

But then I wonder, is this all but a dream? Not sure I believe the fuck me now, but I'm not leaving my husband scenario.
She's a psychologist with a gorgeous husband who is great with her kids, has money, and loves her deeply...and she risks fucking it all up because she's horny for a cliche in a leather jacket? Her thought wasn't to just get sex therapy and/or be open about what she wanted?

The reason this show exists is to glorify the idea of cheating, or wanting to cheat. That's literally all this is.
Sex scenes are hot but I‚Äôm really annoyed by everyone‚Äôs behavior. Cooper- Don‚Äôt read your wife‚Äôs journal. Don‚Äôt recreate hot ex sex you‚Äôll be second place every time, and she‚Äôll just think yep Brad definitely did it better. Talk to your wife and have real moments of intimacy that lead to passion. AND if your wife is riding you you better focus and turn off the damn TV. Billie- you need to buy a second vibrator or 2. Talk to your husband about your needs. Either password protect your journal or don‚Äôt write that crap down ( evidence is never good). You are already being emotionally slutty you may as well have had sex with Brad. Protect your children at all costs, you are being thoughtless and selfish. Brad- leave that girl alone she‚Äôs a hot mess. You‚Äôve said your piece.
I'm not into the style of the erotic scenes, I fast-forward through most of them, and the show isn't exactly a prestige drama, I only keep watching because I like to entertain the fantasy that the lost love of my life will come back a changed man in about 6 and half years, which is not gonna happened and admittedly quite pathetic.   
If those two don't end-up together, I'm at high risk to starting listening to Ed Sheran again. 

But mostly, why does Billie own just one night gown? That's not sanitary.
That could have been the worst show I have ever seen they built the whole story of cooper being the good guy, and proving that the good guy wins in the end. But she chooses the guy with the bigger cock? The whole show showed what a cunt brad was and how all copper wanted to do was have a happy family. Billie could be the worst character ever made in television history. She genuinely chose better sex over her husband and kids, what the actual fuck. And the ending oh my fucking god they built the entire last episode to Billie finally waking the fuck up and realising that cooper is the person she should stay with not only because he is the better guy, but also because of her kids. And omg brad could be the biggest cunt ever put in television. It took him one day after his girlfriend had a miscarriage to make out with some other chick and then kick her out of his house. And he gets the fucking girl. This show is a stain to Netflix.
It's not the greatest of shows, and I did find myself hating it at times, but overall it's okay. For me, the ending kind of helped redeem it in my opinion. >!This definitely seemed like it was going to be one of the shows pushing the normal narrative of monogamy is hard but it's worth it and everyone ends up happy. So I love they are actually going to dive into maybe an open marriage.!<
It‚Äôs annoying me so much that Billie‚Äôs bff is totally fine that brad filmed them having sex, and that Billie watched?? Yea you filmed me having sex without my consent and watched me whilst jerking off, but omg diD mY AsS loOk GoOd?
You mean to tell me that all Brad gotta do is finger the pussy and it‚Äôs on?

ALSO, why is no body talking about how Cooper can‚Äôt stay hard?
There is some awful acting going on in this show. Like, real bad. And some of the dialogue isn't doing the actors any favors.
[removed]
I am facing a scarily similar situation in my relationship (minus the kids) so I thought the show was very relatable and shows how the decision to be with either Cooper or Brad is so difficult and confusing, to a point where her decision changes by the minute. I know it's a scripted show but I was hoping to get a sense of clarity on my own life and the decision I should make watching the show and seeing what the main character did.

The most interesting thing the show talks about in my opinion is whether you can have it all with 1 person? Being with Cooper gives her the 85% which is safety, security and stability etc. Being with Brad gives her the amazing sex, the rush, adventure also the fact that she is the most herself with Brad. But does she only get this rush and feeling of adventure with him because she can't have him? Because of how toxic their relationship was and how she could never get him to settle down? If she was married to Brad, would she be fantasizing about a simple life with no drama (that Brad seems to bring) and the white picket fence?

As humans are we ever completely satisfied with what we have or the feeling of missing out on something is normal? Is the secret to a happy marriage just accepting your situation and making the best of it?
I thought I was going to hate it but found the characters relatable. They make mistakes, are obsessive, etc. They're human. I think both Cooper and Billie are going through their own personal issues. Communication would be key but I think they  both feel shame for what they are going through that they can't talk about it, even with each other.
In all, I think the story is about a polyamorous woman who tries monogamy and realizes that it's not working for her as well as she thought it would.
I think the show is trying to show what some women go through when they get married and have children, they feel like the loose themselves (in Billie's case, her fun/adventurous side) she sees her friend Sasha, still doing all that and she hears about it, but in her own marriage she feels unwanted and unseen by Cooper. So she starts fantasizing about her ex, how wanted she felt by him, their intense connection emotionally and physically, the spontaneousness of their sex life.
Cooper is stressed out at work, and the need to provide/do the "manly" things around the house i.e. cutting the grass and doesn't take the time to talk with Billie about how she's feeling, instead reads the journals and thinks that she's just a sex crazy slut. When in reality, all she wants is to feel wanted by her husband. She gave birth to 2 children, is home with them all day and just wants her husband to notice her and in the first episode it's very clear that she doesn't feel wanted or noticed.
Cooper doesn't try and talk things out with Billie, he just fucks her out of anger and still has trouble staying hard long enough to pleasure Billie, instead she just feels even more unwanted by the change in how he is with her during sex. The swingers episode had me fucked up and I saw just how much anger Cooper really had built up towards Billie; it never should've gotten to that point, they should have talked through their issues, yes he felt bad afterwards but again, he just shut down with anger. 

Honestly, if Cooper was willing to just have a conversation with Billie and try to understand how she was feeling and if Billie never actually saw Brad I feel like Cooper and Billie could've worked through everything and been even stronger than they were before.(yes, there would be no show if that happened lol but that's my opinion)
But since she actually saw Brad and he was pursuing her, she felt wanted the way she wanted Cooper to want her and that's where the problem was.
I think this show did a tremendous job at seeing how everything would play out if a women who felt unwanted and was fantasizing about someone actually pursued it. Which IMO is the premise of the show and how broken families start and that the grass ain't always greener on the side, but where you water it
I understand recessive genes tyvm, but one of my petty annoyances in television and film is casting of children who don‚Äôt resemble their parents.  Sarah (Billie) is obviously a Persian woman popping out these pasty blonde blue eyed children no doubt to fit this Connecticut Stepford vision üòÇ
did you guys notice that she was drinking wine in episode 6 in that flashback when she was supposed to be pregnant? helloooo
Ah so *that‚Äôs* why he walks so strangely.
I feel bad talking about kids but her son Hudson really gets on my nerves.  Did she just start using the nanny more while she‚Äôs been trying to figure out if she wants to screw Brad again?   The amount of attention a newborn needs is a lot and I‚Äôm having a hard time believing all this.  Plus Cooper is a douche.  He‚Äôs a great provider but he‚Äôs emotionally unavailable and doesn‚Äôt want to screw his hot wife?
This is the perfect show that proves that women need to be protected from themselves. The man gave her EVERYTHING and that ONE thing she can‚Äôt have is going to destroy their family smh.
My boss once told me that like 85-90% of life's problems can be solved just by effective communication. Having that security of being on the same page is SOOOO relieving mentally. Billie and Cooper were NEVER on the same page, starting off with sex desires and continuing with them sneaking off with Brad and Francesca respectively. 

Granted, there is no show if Billie and Cooper talk about the journal and their sexual expectations, but I'm pretty sure the male ego is probably HEAVILY bruised knowing that you'll NEVER satisfy your wife the way her ex did AND reading all about the experiences PLUS seeing the dudes dong. Like that would immediately make any man insecure about their relationship IF not discussed. 

Overall, this show felt like textbook narcissism. Brad basically is a POS to Billie but they have bomb sex.  Brad always promised to change/do better but how many times do you hear that before it's actually nonsense and he hasn't changed. Dude left Billie after a miscarriage and had an overall toxic relationship... nah words without action ain't shit.

Cooper is one of those people pleasers who'll do anything for approval, he's probably been praised his whole life, so seeing him being told that his sex game is weak/passion ain't there, he reads the journal (specifically about what makes his wife have an orgasm) and fails, and has a midlife crisis over it bc now he doesn't have that mental security of being on the same page. Gets to the point  where Brad's in his head in EVERY sex act (car and swingers party), tryna be someone he's not to appease his wife. Overall tho, he has some issues to sort out, especially his insecurity. 

Grass ain't greener on the other side, it's only greener where you water it.
This show is why you have to communicate in marriage lol. Bruh these characters are ridiculous. I‚Äôm on episode 8 and I don‚Äôt know who I hate the most.

Billie and Brads relationship seemed to be all sex, good sex, but just sex nonetheless. I was completely over this show when we saw just exactly how they broke up. Literally throwing her things that he packed into the elevator! Like what! She completely romanticized their entire relationship, and to ruin her life and her kids life for that was just extremely selfish.
My god this is triggering if you‚Äôve been on the wrong end of infidelity.

I can‚Äôt believe a TV show wasted my time and triggered in such a way. Literally every character minus the kids was trash.

Billie for obvious reasons. Get a hobby ffs. You don‚Äôt work and have a nanny to keep the house. For someone use supposed to be a psychologist, you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd get therapy for her mid-life crisis but I guess risking your family is worth the trouble. How about having a real discussion with your husband about your needs instead of expecting him to read your mind. 

Brad is white Future with an accent. Daddy issues is another one that needs to work his trauma out in therapy instead of raw dogging anything that moves.

Sasha is a trash best friend. Laying with your best friends ex is op behavior. You mean to tell me an Ivy League graduate can‚Äôt figure out that she‚Äôs a prop to get closer to your best friend? She‚Äôs a whole snake for that.

Those Stepford wife friends are trash too and personify everything I hate about suburban living. A bunch of ladies who are bored at home with nothing to do but call the police on me for playing basketball in their neighborhood. A bunch of suburbanites who‚Äôs entire personality is built around keeping up with the Jones. All of them grew up with marriage as their endgame. No ambition, no hobbies. Just toxic suburban culture I want to avoid at all costs.
Okay soooo here‚Äôs a hot take‚Ä¶

Billy AND cooper talked and agreed they want to hook up with other people on the side. Which is why a) Billie went to brads so sure of not leaving him and wanting to fuck and b) brad called Francesca. Also, he wasn‚Äôt tracking her to find her but more so just to see her there and know what she‚Äôs doing. I feel like after all Billie went through (and how hard she stood by Coopers side) there‚Äôs gotta be a reason for the madness. Brad even said ‚Äúshe wouldn‚Äôt cheat, THATS the women you married‚Äù when cooper came to se whim (foreshadowing ???)

Thoughts?
This show has a lot of flaws, so much shit that was just down right messed up. To start off I was not a fan of Cooper at all, and the more they pushed the good guy premise just made me dislike him even more. Yea maybe he does the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing, but his motives behind them were shit. I felt like he never truly listened to Billie and what she wanted. I don‚Äôt know, I just feel like his shit actions were trying to be covered by the premise of ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù BS. Honestly his actions felt more like abuse to me then Brads did, it was just dished out in a different less obvious form. Now Brad is a lot of things and many of them make him a shit person, no one can deny that. I just felt like the whole time he had overall good intentions. Like yea he treated her like shit in the past and them splitting up was the right move then. But clearly they just have this connection that is so much more then her and Cooper. Plus 10 years later and he has worked on his shit, from what I saw he did the work. Does that make him prefect now? No of course not, but are we really going to push the premise that people can‚Äôt change and evolve when they work through past trauma, child hood trauma at that? Past actions done due to deep rooted trauma can make the best people do awful, horrible shit. That doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt change and work on the unhealthy habits. 

I just felt like she settled with Cooper because he was the easy, simple, comfortable guy. Maybe my romantic ass needs to take a step back here but for me Cooper was just not it, and with that I was not a fan of the ending it just felt like another settle that no one in the show will be happy with.

But besides all that the plot of the show just completely hit me right in the gut. As a single mom I completely understood every emotion Billie was feeling. Not even having my ‚ÄúCooper‚Äù but I feel all that she is feeling. Being a mother can really make you loose yourself. You get lost in it all, its not just you anymore it‚Äôs this whole other human being that is now your sole responsibility. And that shit is HARD, and then on top of that to have a partner like Copper. I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt blame her for everything she did. Sometimes ‚Äúperfect‚Äù just fucking sucks.

I am just word vomiting at this point. Also sorry for any and all grammar and spelling errors, its not my strong suit. But I would love to hear other prospective on this and if anyone has a similar prospective to me.

Edit: I don‚Äôt deny that Brad did a lot of awful shit. Just wanted to clarify my point, that I think we are suppose to like Cooper the best and I just didn‚Äôt. He rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning, plus I felt like even if we removed Brad from the situation Billie and Cooper were doomed to crash and burn already. I saw so many red flags between them from the start and then when Brad got thrown in the mix it just amplified them. To be honest the only good/innocent people is the show were the kids in my opinion. I think Brad and Billie are meant for each other, they both can be toxic together. (Slightly less toxic then their first relationship but toxic none the less) And Cooper can go off and be with someone like Francesca who I think is a better fit for him. Overall I think everyone in the show just made awful decisions and blamed everyone else for them. This whole show was a slow awful train wreck.
I have no one else to discuss this show with so here I am.  I hate watched it most of it.  Then actually was interested in the last couple of episodes.  So many things I hated.  So many things at th end that I actually maybe understood or liked.  

The characters they were not redeemable.  Not really even at the end.  And it really pissed me off the lack of talking between cooper and Billie.  

1) obviously talk about the damn journal and your sex life and what needs to change or be adjusted then 

2) when you wind up at a sex party maybe talk about your limits of what is and isn't okay before you know doing anything.

  3) proving you can have sex with your wife just because you need to while not listening to what she needs during that session god that was hard.  You could see her eyes just start glaze over so honestly well done acting on that part.  But yeh not okay.  Especially when sex is part of the problem this won't help things 

4) wtf are none of her friends or husband going maybe something more is going on here.  She just had a secobd kid.  She has lost herself in her identity of being mom and why the hell is no one like yeh having a kid is hard.  Having the mom identity and if it is your only one if fucking hard.  Let's talk about how to make it easier for you? Do you need to go back to work? What other ondentity can we carve out for you

5) maybe this will normalize all the normal things that happen within relationships.  And how people try to fix them.  

6) but really people just be open with your spouse.  It can hurt.  It is hard.  But it is the best way for each of you to get what you need from each other.

This show is annoying.  So many things about it to hate.  But also very real.  What works for one couple may not work for another (i.e. the sex party).
Hubby and I tried watching this. We lasted all of 20 minutes. Nothing a 20min conversation about expectations couldn‚Äôt fix.
Was anyone else just extremely distracted by how long Billie's nipples were?? Forgive me if that's a common thing after childbirth but it was all I could see whenever she was naked lmao
What an unsatisfying show with bastard characters. I hate all of them and their terrible decision making skills. Was the end supposed to be some sort of #girlboss thing where we‚Äôre supposed to be happy for her? Because all it did was annoy me. 

Billie is a spineless cheater
Brad is a douchebag sociopath
Cooper is deeply angered and resentful
Billie and Cooper definitely should have gone to counseling.  Once he confided that he read her journal, the first thing they should of done was counseling.  What happened in the last episode, two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.  They are both toxic and a marriage like that will not work.
Cooper is a good looking guy with money. If he was single he would have 0 problem meeting women. If I were him I'd divorce Billie so fast she wouldn't be able to finish saying "Brad" before the divorce papers were served.
I don‚Äôt think Cooper is nice as he claims or seen to be. Some scenes about him, bother me. Happy to get downvoted, but anyway back to the point.

Billie definitely has some form of PPD.

There‚Äôs one scene that bothered me about Cooper, it was after he found out about the journal and he tried to be like Brad.

In the car he was trying to seduce and have sex with Billie. She was enjoying it at first and he seemed to struggle. She kept saying no, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen. And continued. No means no. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you say it, no means to stop.

Also, when she was trying to seduce and have sex with him in the initial episode.. He was more concerned about watching football?

That‚Äôs literally when she started fantasising about Brad.

I think Cooper is ‚Äòsomewhat nice‚Äô at a push, but he has his flaws.

But, overall Billie is worse of course. And Brad is just well, Brad. That dinner scene alone was like wtf lol. 

In season 2: from what I can see on Instagram (the hyping) is definitely happening. Brad will be with Billie and Cooper with Francesca.
So my thing is, it is an awfully toxic situation & screams therapy. But logically thinking about it, do you members believe that marriage can only be A. A stable & consistent OR B. A thrill. Ie it can‚Äôt be both in one.

Do you believe it can ever be both options? I truly believe it can based on the person you‚Äôre married to.. but I have no experience on the matter whatsoever.
Realistically on that ideology, pornstars/swingers must have the best marriages then?

ALSO: THOUGHTS ON THE LAST EPISODE?
LASTLY: I don‚Äôt see Cooper as the bad guy (apart from reading the journal) - anyone else or am I missing something crucial? It‚Äôs almost an Anna Karenina situation.
This is the best bad show I have ever seen oh my God I hope Netflix renews it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever watched a show with such laughably horrible dialogue, and that includes Riverdale.
Oh thank God I am not the only one who found this terrible.¬† Others that have watched it, loved it but besides the repetitive sex scenes and that gym shower scene¬† can't tell me why. So many things annoyed me besides the crappy dialogue and overall bad acting. Like after 8yrs why does she still have Brad's number in her phone? 
Sasha being fine and almost happy that Billie watched her having sex with Brad. Which him doing that is a completely different issue
From ep4 honestly just wanted to see Billie fuck Brad and realise it doesn't live up to potential because she's in a different place in life, destroy her marriage and then sort out her own issues.
Billie is so selfish & brad is borderline abusive. Also wtf when brad wanted to see her children? Crossing the line. Especially after their past and experience with Billie pregnant
Maybe I missed something but how did Brad and Devon go from hating each other to friends again towards the end? Same with Billie and the preppy happy all the time mom. I didn't catch an apology?
Man I must be hella lucky cuz I have my one person that I have everything with. Y‚Äôall might be looking in the wrong places or have bad taste in men. In addition Billie is fucking psycho and toxic as fuck. This show is trash too. Smh. You can‚Äôt drag Cooper through the mud because you want ‚Äúa good fuck‚Äù like gtfo üòÇ so many chances and so many things you could have done differently before getting knocked up with 2 kids and creating a life far into it and now you wanna leave and go with brad but not leave cooper? Lmao this chick needs therapy
I feel like this show tried to make women seem sexually empowered and liberated but it just made us look bad üòÇ
Billie is a lost cause. If you werent ready for monogamy then don‚Äôt do it. Her journal started in like June or something, why didn‚Äôt she communicate to her husband about their dead bedroom situation? Instead she writes explicit stories about her ex, basically emotionally cheating on her husband at that point. I honestly think Cooper will be better off with Franchesca. Billie can wallow in her own mess with Brad.
So is nobody going to talk about how Billie and Cooper tried to get it on multiple times but couldn't keep it up. And Trina stops by and he's done in a few seconds??? That would make my blood boil
cooper & francessca i ship
Currently watching the show on E4 and this kinda sucks, mom having fantasies, crying about how she had a hot sex life? Move the fuck on!
unpopular opinion: billie was just trying to utilize a coping skill of journaling while dealing with PPD & none of this would‚Äôve happened if Cooper didn‚Äôt go snooping through her shit. Like yes a password would‚Äôve been cool but as her husband, if you see that she left a document open, leave it the fuck alone. The only reason Brad came back into her life besides in her thoughts was because Billie went to go confide in her shitty friend & he was there. She actively denied his advances & never touched him, meanwhile golden boy Cooper is letting his friend‚Äôs wife suck him off at a sex party in front of his crying wife. But thank god he‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù right? And yes Brad also sucks, in fact they all suck, but Billie isn‚Äôt the only one in the wrong here.
trashy show  but guilty pleasure.  one of the most unrealistic shows i‚Äôve ever seen in my life.   Do Brads Billies, and Cooopers really exist.   No body poor or no white .  They need a woke version imho

I really don't think I could stay friends with a woman who slept with someone I was that deeply in love with.
Some thoughts
- Billie and cooper‚Äôs marriage was in danger not because the sex was bad; i think they lacked the trust and communication necessary to be in a partnership. Folks adore Cooper at the beginning because he displays what we think of as an ideal husband and one that a woman should be happy to have (good father, good provider, doesn‚Äôt cheat), but the major issues i noticed were how neither of them discussed what they wanted and how it made them feel, and that Cooper kept breaching her trust by reading the journal. Cooper also wouldn‚Äôt discuss the journal issue at all, and they needed that conversation. 
- Billie would have been better off by going back to school or working. She wasn‚Äôt fulfilled by being a SAHM and that‚Äôs ok. That was another conversation that she needed to have with Cooper. But also I suspect that Billie has post partum depression and trauma from miscarrying. 
- I don‚Äôt think Cooper is evil, but the relationship with Billie was bringing out his worst. They would have probably been better off coparenting. He would do better with someone like Francesca (strong and more dominant with similar interests)
- Billie and her best friend (forgot her name) were another form of a toxic relationship. Billie getting off to watching Brad and her friend sex is so damn violating. Her friend continuing to save sex with the man who her best friend is in love is another breach of trust.

 I loved the series! It is very realistic!

Women with a past like Billies usually get tired of being hurt and go find a "good guy" to save them. However they soon realize that "good guy" cannot give them the rush that the toxic environment that Brad gave from the "good guy". Some people are use to TOXIC environments and do not know how to thrive in peaceful ones. 

Now we cannot ignore the fact that she gave up her own identity to become a housewife and mother and the fact that Cooper got comfortable and was not pleasing her sexually.

I do not blame Cooper because as the series noted he is the perfect GUY! Hell I wanted to marry Cooper half way through the series because he TRIED! however he messed up trying to be guy that he was not and could never be. He should have just been himself and gave her the love and attention he did when they met! 

To sum this up they lacked communication! and I feel the whole thing could have been avoided with simple adult communication and honesty!!!!
[deleted]
This show is bad vibes. Is this how adults treat each other coz if so I want out
I can‚Äôt believe they name this dude Brad and tried to sell him as a sex god I just do not see it, he looks like a lion to me
Billie doesn't deserve Cooper at all.
Billie is a bitch. She started all the drama. She can't make a straight decision. She is ruining Cooper's life as well as the children's life.
Brad is pathetic. He is lost.
All these drama happened because they can't make straight decisions and stick to it.
It's disappointing that after all Cooper has done,  Billie decided to cheat on him.
I am just watching the first season now‚Ä¶ and here are my thoughts. All of the characters are flawed. And that‚Äôs human. But the character I think are just outright flawed with no helping. Cooper. This whole thing starts from him reading Billies journal. Which is just kinda fucked and gross to be honest. Then, instead of just having a conversation with her, he then tries to be more like Brad to please her‚Ä¶ to only THEN blame her for him becoming someone he doesn‚Äôt recognize. Be an adult, take responsibility for your actions. It‚Äôs clear to everyone that neither he or Billie are as happy in their relationship as they thought they were and that is OKAY! Sometimes you end up in relationships that fizzle out. It happens. Move on.
I spent so much time yelling at the screen at how stupid Billie is üòÇ it‚Äôs so ridiculous but I just cannot look away.
The thing that triggered me was that she kept leaving her kids... I have a 3yo and 6 month old and no way would I just leave them! I just don't understand her. 
When she returned home and the kids were gone, I really felt her pain. But she still didn't learn.
[deleted]
I hate Billie. She sucks.
Totally unrelated, but was Hudson's preschool teacher Paige from Degrassi?
Totally not important but why is Billie holding an iPhone 11 Pro when she comes home to Brad sitting there with her stuff? Isn‚Äôt that supposed to be a decade ago? üòÖ They don‚Äôt even try to make the flashbacks look realistic, this show is not good.
I can‚Äôt tell if this show all together was just supposed to speak to women who have desires and question their relationship from time to time or what. Like multiple times I thought it would end with her realizing what she had, I loved the line about having it all just not at the same time in your life, but then it ends with her running back to Brad? No way that dude had actually changed. Also, couldn‚Äôt B have just talked to her husband and went to see her sex therapist professor from school and started working on things privately? Couldn‚Äôt they have like started with watching some porn together or trying to make more time for intimacy before full-blown betrayal of trust and going head first into swinger territory? (Not that anything is wrong with swingers I just feel like there‚Äôs a lot of steps and rules involved to that similar to BSDM.) 

Like, as a 26 year old watching this, i wonder, is marriage like this? Do you really have this burning desire to be your old younger sexier self like about to boil out from inside you? I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend 2 years and we talk about marriage all the time and sure, sometimes I miss the sexual relationships I had with my exes but they were HUGE dbags who didn‚Äôt actually care about me and never would‚Äôve stayed by my side like my current boyfriend does.

This show also poses the question, can you really not have the adventurous crazy passion with the person who you trust and can depend on and is your true equal, non-manipulative partner? 

Or is the point of this show after all, to make us question sexual desires and traditional monogamy/marriage and whether or not you can fully have both? 

Either way, I don‚Äôt feel like I really learned anything or left feeling anything lasting from this show. Except maybe that I need to try out that one sex position she mentioned that supposedly is out of this worldü§î
Just finished ep6 and think i know where this is heading but now i kinda want to see it through.

Honestly, the show has been so annoying. But ill focus on the billie girl in this post.

The psychologist going through crisis in her marriage and yet wont even consider doing things differently, not even seeing a therapist. Also, how hard is it to put a stupid password to open you word file; ‚Äúmissbradscock‚Äù would do fine. she is just so f immature. Fantasizing about the brad guy. Communicating with him! Wtf was that dinner idea? What about the kids? , oh whatever the kids, his fingering me‚Ä¶

Listen. I am married. I understand what she is going through. But really, No cock is worth my kids‚Äô even remote chance of sadness. Do they think this is empowering women? Im not saying she has to stay in a loveless marriage. But is it? Lets find out. Talk to your husband. Get therapy. Get a job, get a whatever occupation for gods sake. For someone so ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù she is pretty animalistic to me, moved by sex and hormones. Just terrible. I kinda hope she ends with Brad only to be reminded of why they broke up. And left at that (as please, no second season of this crap). Would be a pretty realistic finale: Billie looking at the camera with a serious fuck my life face.
Seriously....you were in a relationship with Brad 10 yrs ago...10 years ago!!!!

This show was just weird. The endless sex scenes were uncalled for, began to skip it after ep 1
Good intentions ?? No Guy has good intentions will go after a married girl with a infant baby and a four-year-old son. No girl with good intentions will go After a  married  guy with a infant baby and a four your old son. They only have on there mine sex sex sex. Brad has good intentions?? He asked her to stay the night with him knowing she has an infant baby and a four-year-old son at home. Wow
Terrible waste of time!!
Just what we need‚Ä¶ another show that glorifies cheatingüôÉ
Billie is a mistake. I do not wish that on any man.
Billie is so trash goddamn
Was this show written by incels?
Just finished the show. In the words of the late and great Amy Winehouse ‚Äúwhat kind of fuckery is this??‚Äù
Because my god!!! I have NEVER wanted to fight a bitch more than I do Billie right now. The nerve of this woman‚Ä¶ I have no words, I‚Äôm just fuming at this point. Everyone in this show is dumb as hell except for the kids. 

****SPOILER ALERT****





This bitch chooses her husband, they make up and life is all good again and because of one little comment from her friend she is literally running out of her kid‚Äôs school play to have sex with her ex and has the AUDACITY to tell him she‚Äôs not leaving her husband. 

MAAM??? Are you dumb or just stupid???? Her husband better leave her trifling ass. I stg.
Toronto ain‚Äôt New York, Mississauga ain‚Äôt Connecticut.
Does Sarah Shahi (Billie) remind anyone else of Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada?
I actually relate to this show in so many levels...

I‚Äôm currently in a long and serious relationship with a good guy, who never hurt me, and is doing everything in his power to make me happy. And it was all great until we started talking about marriage. 

It‚Äôs been 3 months now that I‚Äôm really confused. Wanted to leave him and change my mind so many times. We talked about all my feelings and he is so positive and optimistic that what we have is real, and we will try everything to make things work for us, so I stayed. 
I‚Äôm terrified of the idea of marriage. Ever since we started talking about it, I‚Äôm constantly dreaming about a guy I dated which I had the best mind blown sex I‚Äôve had in my life. 

Than this show was on in Netflix and It honestly felt like a ‚Äúsign from the world‚Äù. Honestly the sex scenes of Brad and Billy are so similar to what I had, I‚Äôve stopped watching several times because I began to cry so much. But this guy didn‚Äôt want me for real, and my sweet sweet boyfriend who I LOVE (but not in love) is willing to give me the world if I ask.

I wish I could have it all.
Has anyone else noticed that in the gym shower scene Brad is missing the bee tattoo?
Does anyone know where the white nightgown is from that Billie is where tree start of ep1?
She threw the laptop in one episode, but she‚Äôs magically journaling on it again in the next ü§î
None of the psychology in this show was accurate, it was just pathetic
This whole show was sad. I don‚Äôt think the problem was Billie. I think the problem is being raised in a society that glorifies pleasure above all else. I‚Äôm definitely part of the minority that believes sexual/drug ‚Äúexperimentation‚Äù in your younger years is foolish and has consequences. Learning self control and discipline free you from being a slave to your desires. But that isn‚Äôt a new idea, it‚Äôs just difficult to do. It shouldn‚Äôt be understated how difficult it is to do. Hopefully people will learn the value of living for something more than oneself. I don‚Äôt feel judgement toward either side, I just hope we as humankind can do better than this narrative.
This was the worst show I‚Äôve ever watched
I've read most of the comments, and I believe most of them are correct, but we should consider it from Billie's perspective, Brad's perspective, Cooper's perspective, the children's perspective, and finally, from the human perspective, after we consider it from our perspective. If you are a human and have such a story in your past, I believe you will never forget it, even in the future. Maybe until you experience more and more, because if you would like to forget or get used to something, you should repeat it. In the world, most things are  paradise. It is important from which side you look at the glass.     
   
Notice : Even if something happened in the past, it should be forever secret. Because if a men or woman knows  or learns something in the past, it will not be forgotten
Billie is a narcissistic manipulative twat. Hoping Cooper dumps her with the quickness üòé
I thought the show seemed pretty fake from the beginning, like as in the first scene. A woman breastfeed a newborn having wild sex fantasies about an ex from 8 years ago? Just seems unrealistic. Everyone is different but when I had two kids under 2 and was nursing, trying to adjust to being a mom the last thing on my mind was sex...with anyone. Billie has a life that most women dream about (or think they want). It's hard to imagine someone could be that sexed up to let all that go.
I‚Äôm on episode seven and I am just loving this absolutely feminine show. Lol it is definitely for women, we love our storylines in our porn. It‚Äôs hot, sexy, and fun. 

I love the opulence and the beautiful people and the twisted emotional storyline. Honestly it‚Äôs comforting for me to watch. She screws up so much, but she‚Äôs still a likable character. There‚Äôs nuance. All the characters have issues. You can‚Äôt forget that this show literally opened with Cooper talking about how cool his boss is. The red flags were there from him from the start. Reading the journal was just the cherry on top.

It challenges morals, because what Billie and Brad are doing is objectively terrible but I sympathize with them. Just two people who couldn‚Äôt forget each other. I don‚Äôt hate them for it. And I love the throwback scenes. 

I don‚Äôt even hate Cooper, even though he‚Äôs a dunce. I hope things work out with him and his boss.

Can‚Äôt wait to see what ridiculous drama happens in season two üòÖ
This show was so bad its not even a guilty pleasure, it's zero pleasure. Horrible writing, horny mom starts thinking about big dick ex and is writing shit about. Cooper was amazing through and through. I fucking hated the main character throughout. What an awful show. Not to mention, I know this is a sex/life show, but just randomly putting in sex scenes because you don't have any writing to fill it with. Fucking awful, through and through.
Can‚Äôt stand Billie at all. If you want hot sex and fantasize about your ex till you fuck up your family, then get a divorce and go fuck your ex. If you want to have a stable life and family and a guy who loves you, then figure out the shit out and be a wife and you can still go pursue your career. Don‚Äôt act like the whole world has wronged you and be a little bitch crying over everything.
You do realize if your husband or Wife sucks in bed like you say. It doesn‚Äôt give them the right to cheat on each other. on some of the scenes I mentioned were flash backs.  episode 6.  Sorry it‚Äôs pretty hard to explain to me the sex scenes are flash backs. If some chance they were that had to mean she was dating Brad and married to Cooper at the same time??? If you remember Brad and her in a dark alley kissing and grinding each other. Cooper texting her where are you I‚Äôm burning dinner call me. Not to mention it was pretty selfish of Brad to ask her to spend the night knowing fully well she has a baby at home with a six-year-old son. Not to mention the swinging Party. They went together. Cooper did not Bring her there. 

Billie talking with the guy  he asked her what does sex mean to you. She tells him desire freedom to do anything to be anyone. She Annette she is cheating on her husband. Let me guess the scene when she‚Äôs watching a video of Brad having sex with another girl me while she‚Äôs in the house that her and Cooper and her two kids live in. She playing in getting off on herself watching the video. With her husband in the next room sleeping. Come now
It's interesting to see people different opinions. Either it's completely unrealistic or it happened/happening to them.

For me this hits close. A bit on the nose actually. Right down to the use of "Isn't It Strange" by Celeste...

I do feel though it should only have 1 season. It's a good mini series.
Not sure if this has been discussed, but wtf is Billie doing downing all that booze when she‚Äôs breastfeeding?!! Wow, mom of the year.
......and she left the guy from shameless with their 3 kids & is now brad/Adam Damos ‚Äô irl girlfriend.  Talk about life imitating art.
i'm quite late to the party but i think Billie is just so reckless...
I was annoyed that Billie kept throwing "you're just like your Dad" in Brad's face. It was obviously an issue for him but she kept throw it at him.. I disagree with the fact that Billie told him to go find his Dad or else. I guess I just wanted her to tell him that his Dad leaving wasn't about him, or that now he has a chance to do better than his father before him.

I also felt embarrassed for Cooper trying to copycat what Billie wrote in her journal. She just wanted to feel like her husband wanted her and couldn't resist her.

The biggest problem is that Adam Demos and Sarah Shahi have such insane chemistry that when it switches to her and Mike Vogel it's just like, eh.
So who thinks Adam Demos broke up Sarah Shahi‚Äôs real life 20 year marriage?
This show is trash to married people.  It‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs sex novel.   It‚Äôs that book that‚Äôs on the grocery store shelf in the check out line 10 years ago.   This show plants seeds in people heads about cheating on their spouse and instills ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù to women and men who will use it as a tool to ‚Äúembrace their sexuality‚Äù without the fear of consequence.    We‚Äôre talking about it why?  Because it capture people‚Äôs attention and there‚Äôs something to think about even though most will say that ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a show‚Äù.    It‚Äôs the divide between men and women and has a real life effect.   Life imitates art and Sarah is getting divorced in real life.   Yeah, relationships are work and sex with the same person for most gets old.   It doesnt mean that you can deny vows.   Don‚Äôt let sin get the better of you.   Let your word have meaning and when you say it you mean it‚Ä¶
This show is a Twilight FanFiction. Change my mind.
As trashy as this show is, I hated the last line of "just fuck me" or whatever she said.  It's just cheesy and trashy.  Enough of the F bombs, lady.....less is more.
Who else thought it was really hot that billie was so insatiable that she would even risk losing a man that 99.99 percent of women will never get just for some passionate rough sex?

At first ---I didnt like billie at all. I thought she was the typical modern toxic wife--- selfish, entitled and unrealistic. I was totally on Coopers side the entire season ( with the exception of him overacting to reading her journal. I would have just calmly shower her the fuckin door)

but upon some further reflection -- billie actually isnt really that bad of a person. Shes not perfect but is in fact overall a decent mother and wife.

The thing is she is just so insatiable and wants the spirit absolutely railed out of her. I dont think theres anything wrong with that. If i was Cooper once i realized she actually does care about the family id encouraged her getting her railed on the side and even see how far we could push her limits.

Id be all in.

At the end of the season when they were at the kids play and all should could think about was cock at her own kids play---that was beyond hot.

The way that through everything, the therapy, the deep reflection and supposedly having a cathartic experience and recommitting to cooper --- she still literally ran off at the end of the day to brads apartment and begged him to fuck her. That sent me through the roof so hard.
I don‚Äôt understand how they made a show about this for so many episodes. Billie willingly got married (a monogamous, sexually exclusive, life long relationship), had a whole child, moved to the suburbs, had a whole second child, and then decided she can‚Äôt do this life because of the poor sex? How can you make this big and important of a commitment for so long and then just decide to stop? If sex is such a huge motivator for you (absolute dealbreaker in Billie‚Äôs case it seems), then certainly don‚Äôt commit to something that doesn‚Äôt include that. And let‚Äôs just say if you do run into that problem after committing (which you shouldn‚Äôt if you decided ahead of time but whatever), your solution is to then be indecisive and let your spouse worry (rightfully) if you are going to sleep with someone else (which she does end up doing)? If you want an open relationship where you are free to sleep with other people, then just say that? Communicate with your spouse about it and if they‚Äôre not into it/disagree with your wish, then the relationship is a dud because it clearly lacks what you value so strongly and you two probably shouldn‚Äôt be together. If you have kids that makes things harder, sure, but then it‚Äôs simply too late and you need to make sure they are cared for and develop healthily. 
Clearly if you don‚Äôt want to be monogamous then don‚Äôt commit to a long term sexually exclusive relationship. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with coming to a consensual agreement with your partner at the outset where you can still be fulfilled sexually by others and still be in a relationship with your partner. Maybe Billie thought she could do the marriage and kids thing at first but then two kids and years later she realized this wasn‚Äôt the case (weird but okay), but even then her way of handling it was terrible. What‚Äôs embarrassing is that the writers think this (especially the ending) is empowering women in a big ‚ÄúDon Draper moment‚Äù where somehow it‚Äôs okay to cheat on your spouse (yes, sleeping with someone outside of your monogamous relationship you agreed upon is cheating even if you say you‚Äôre not ‚Äòleaving your husband‚Äô) when it was never ‚Äúokay‚Äù for Don to do it either. It‚Äôs literally one of his flaws along with many misogynistic and unethical things that occurred in the 50s portrayed in Mad Men. The audience always knows it‚Äôs wrong and would of course never approve of it irl, it‚Äôs just part of the show for entertainment. This isn‚Äôt a defense for Cooper either btw, he was wronged but also didn‚Äôt directly face the problem and instead tried to become someone he wasn‚Äôt. His fear of losing Billie (the mother of his children) is understandable but he lacked the confidence to thoroughly see to the end of the situation by getting the truth out of Billie and not go around stalking Brad and trying weird sex things. Idk kind of a trash show for horny viewers tbh.
So many people are commenting on this show with all the right answers, but would not handle it nearly as well in real life. I think this show accomplished what it set out to do lol
"10.  Objectively, the story is kind of bad.  This is basically the stuff of trashy romance novels.  It was an entertaining binge on a Saturday night but it‚Äôs not winning any awards.  "

I actually think it's a necessary story because women are pretty much not allowed by society to feel and act that way! Do you really believe the bullshit that marriage is happily ever after and women are satisfied and happy?! Newsflash, most are not! Most are Billie with less balls. Few people get to marry the love of their life and even if you do, what are the odds that he is in love too?? What I know for a fact is that most marriages are a facade, the prim and proper, wholesome image is AN ACT. For the vast majority of marriages. This show represents the reality that society tries to sweep under the rug and does not want to see.
I didn't realize this would be Unpopular Opinion, but I masturbated multiple times during this show
The characters in this show are so damn unlikable. I won't be surprised if it gets another season, but I definitely won't be watching. These characters are incapable of self-growth. Billie will never stop being an insatiable cheater and Cooper will never stop obsessing over her past and his failures. They all need to let go, get some help from a therapist, and move on.
Can‚Äôt stand the main character, B. As a man watching this with my wife, it made my blood boil.lol She completely destroys Cooper. I won‚Äôt be surprised if he commits suicide. Poor dude tries to live his best life to be a good husband, father and man and this is the thanks he gets?? He should definitely bang the hell out of his Asian boss and forget about having a relationship with B.
I watched two episodes of this Sex/Life on Netflix because everyone is talking about it. But it's too much explicit sex for me. Is it worth it to continue? The lead character is interesting but it does feel like a ripoff of Sex and the City.
I kind of accidentally watched the show, binged it randomly in like 2 hours with a ton of skipping just to get to the end....and...yea

The way I found the show was randomly getting an email from Netflix and while holding my phone by the screen while multi tasking I clicked the link that launched the app. I'm a straight, married, 35ish male. Not at all the demographic for this show I feel (more on that in a bit) but my younger pre-married self had a minor crush on Sara Shahi and maybe that created the temptation to take a peek at the show.

I've been dealing with the concept of "chasing one's ghost" recently... More sports related for me. This notion of remembering a pre-marriage and younger version of me that was pretty decent at the game of basketball, and now noticing I'm a shell of that player. I think that's what intrigued me. Before long that intrigue became more of me observing a car crash.

In general "Billie" is a garbage character. By episode 2 you're rolling your eyes at this person. Like at first I thought she was just missing the sporadic version of herself, but it's all about one guy, or maybe less about the guy but more about his physical capabilities....? I don't know. I think the show could have tackled any of the following concepts, chasing your past self, love over lust, the value of family, growing up.... But the ending.... It just "Nopes" any real lesson or philosophical thought and says "the power of a women's boner is strong"

And that last part bothers me because... I don't know who the demographic is here. That ending is insulting to women i feel. It's the kind of characterization you would see in the mind of a teenage boy who discard the nuance of a person and focuses on the physical attraction of a relationship. Worst yet is the randomness of the ending. Billie walks out of her CHILDREN'S school play with sex on the mind... Like... Wtf?!  I can get the decision to drop the guy you married because the guy you "loved" (ha!) is back in your life, but your children.... Like... way to fail at life and just be the worst person on the planet. You couldn't just have an affair like a normal person? You ditch your kids in a very obvious place way just to sleep with a guy who likely would've been down to get down with you the next day.... Man that angered me.

Back to the demographic - who does this story appeal to?  People who wanna watch a porn without watching porn. That's what this show is ultimately. It's attractive people being put into unrealistic and highly sexualized situations just so the viewer can get off or something. Porn... Garbage.

I was able to finish the show in about two hours by skipping all the sex and crying scenes.... Tells you a lot of what we are dealing with here.

Yea.... This is a waste of time show.
This show is honestly extremely toxic all around I literally had to stop it and leave the room at the cooper gets blown scene. Other than the fact that it hit way too close to home with the Brad and Billie relationship let‚Äôs outline the toxic parts that lead up to my rage quit. The prosthetic dick that completely poisons the idea of what even a big dick looks like, giving girls expectations  that literally don‚Äôt exist outside of the medical journal community and warping mens views more about what women want. The demonization of the poly/swinger community. Not addressing anyone as manipulative or at least allowing a ‚Äúconcrete couple‚Äù to talk things through in a rational sphere for more than 3 minutes. The manipulative ex who if there bond was so strong would have never FaceTimed her during sex with her best friend to test that bond. The list goes on and on
Unpopular opinion, by the end, Brad was a much better guy than Cooper. I found Cooper to be narcissistic, and really expected that cookie cutter life. Brad was happy for life to be whatever it would be as long as it‚Äôs with B. I believe someone‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrad‚Äù , to have all that lust etc, probably isn‚Äôt the right person at the time, but if both people grow and mature you can have the passion and the security. 
Thoughts?
Such unlikeable characters, all around. Nobody is that shitty. I only liked the kids.
Anyone else think this whole thing started because Cooper was projecting his own fantasies for his boss and that‚Äôs what led him to read the journal and get upset? I mean I would think he‚Äôd be upset regardless but I feel like when you already have feelings yourself you react worse.
1. Billi is a terrible protagonist and her trying to use "empowering the woman's soul" kind of words to justify her actions at the end is terrible.  Shes just justifying whatever "freedom" means to her.
2. Connor was done dirty.  I don't know why he won't leave her for Francesca.
3. WHY WONT billie just go after fucking brad and leave her godforsaken loveless marriage????? I know she wants to repair shit but it only works if BOTH PARTIES sacrifice and come together
4. and that bs quote of hers saying how women must throw away a part of yourself as they grow up or whatever?? wtf this is life not some fantasy
I have NO sympathy for Billie. She stays out all night with her ex-boyfriend and when she‚Äôs home with her to Kids she‚Äôs on the computer fantasizing about her Ex-boyfriend her four-year-old son has to say at least three orfour times mommy mommy mommy for her to snap out of it and pay attention to him. She plays with her self and masturbates to video of her ex-boyfriend having sex with another girl meanwhile her husband and her kids are in the same house.
I don't know whether watching this past episode 1 because reading the comment it's going to get better.
Does anyone know what brand the pink jacket Billie wears is? I can only find dodgy knock offs
WOW! (need I say more?)
Crappy show

Good sex scenes rho
OMG. Basically, these shows and movies ALWAYS try soo hard to be promarriage even when it's not healthy. We know for a fact that neither Billie nor Cooper are in love because if they were, this situation would not exist. Now that we've established that, Billie, wants security and stability and believes she can get that in Cooper. Shocker to me because I didn't think Cooper was that great to begin with= kinda ignoring her, not attentive, meh sex, etc. Fine, he wasn't an outright dick but still no  prize either. So, you are really giving up passion and being in love for status? Perceived financial security and stability? A wannabe nice guy? The show does highlight some real issues women deal with but can't exactly admit to. Newsflash, happily ever after doesn't exist! You get what you get and most just make do. Stop romanticizing marriage period. 

Best quotes in the movie:

"Maybe you are not lying to me, but you are definitely lying to yourself and I'm just along for the ride." =Cooper

"But do you think you are messing it all up because you've convinced yourself that it's more beautiful than it is?" = Shrink
This was the best horror movie that i've seen in my life by faaar, Lilith playing around having fun and destroying peoples lives
What I do not understand is why she didn't let Cooper fuck franzeska so that he felt the same feelings as Billie.

In my opinion that would be really eye opening for him and I think he'd relate to Billie's sexual aspect.
Just rewatched season one, and I'll continue to tell men that come to me for advice to watch this before they get married nexus this happens all the time.
Their son has attachment issues lmao so over him clocking everyone. ‚ÄúMommy where were you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs daddy?‚Äù ‚ÄúMommy I missed you‚Äù ‚Äúmommy don‚Äôt leave‚Äù. Boy- get a life
Sex/Life series

  
Hello everyone, have you watched or are watching the series Sex/Life. ? . I only have one question. Why didn't Billie set a password on her laptop? I enjoy the series but it‚Äôs so stupid to put something like that in the script. Billie studied to become a psychologist and judging by her character, she is a rather stress-resistant woman - considering all the circumstances of her life. while she is keeping a diary - that is, she could still figure out the password. Especially considering the fact that her husband had already read the diary. Why not post the password after this? My opinion is that she is not only a victim but also an executioner. She herself is looking to be punished. she deliberately did not set a password on the laptop for the second time, like all people would have done, she wanted. for her husband to read the diary. what are your thoughts? is she so messed up Is she really a victim or a punisher here too?
Yes, Billie is such a little bitch and both of those dudes are bad for her. Sasha mentioned in the past that Billie was codependent on Brad but she is also codependent on Copper as well.
Totally agree with you on most of your analysis, although I was more into the story than I expected To be given how many people say it‚Äòs bad! Definitely made me relieved I never married my bad-in-bed-but-reliable bf. 

To point 8 - yes, they‚Äôre really like that in Greenwich, hah.
Heard the full frontal could very likely be a prosthetic haha  apparently that‚Äôs a thing they do when filming.
I‚Äôm still watching ep 6, but in regards to number 2- omg same! I thought people were exaggerating, they were not üò≥üçÜ I‚Äôll be back when I‚Äôm done üòÇ
You summed it up so well! I just honestly didn‚Äôt like coopers character cuz he read her private thoughts and then guilt-tripped her for the rest of the season. I have one more episode left but not sure if I‚Äôm going to watch it, kind of don‚Äôt need to know since got I got the cliff notesüòÇ
Agreed but Billie isn‚Äôt a saint either. Honestly all of them suck in their own ways
Open your mind to the Netflix mind bending reality. It‚Äôs why they placed her in the psychology field, it‚Äôs not about sex, it‚Äôs about desire, feeling needed, and wanting the passion and later honestly losing your well educated self to, well, hang out with babies all day alone in your housewife thoughts, that you later got caught in fantasizing after you personally tried to rid them by getting it all out on paper. And your daily dose of real person time is mute, and you‚Äôre one person/release can‚Äôt quite understand how isolated a stay at home mother is with so much ambition.
UGHHH YES!!! I‚Äôm just trying to finish it but at this point I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs worth it. Everything has been so weak in terms of plot, dialogue and character development.   

I honestly didn‚Äôt think think I would cringe more at something other than 50 shades of gray but this one takes the cake.
ü§®
I love this. The lack of checking on the kids all those hours, really concerns me.
100% agree with all of this
And when cooper talks to francheska (his boss) and rejected calls from B , she had guts to say " please dont this to Hudson (child) , please don't this to us" and at last sucumed to her sluty side. What a dipshit she is. So is brad and cooper as well.
*this show is kinda bad*

writes 6 paragraphs
That‚Äôs fair. 

I do think it was disrespectful for the amount of times she entertained him. She watched him having sex with her best friend while masturbating. She also let him into their house to let him see the babies. She also wanted a double date to prove she wasn‚Äôt cheating also just to find her in the bathroom with Brad.

Cooper had every right to question or to even think she was cheating.
I don‚Äôt think it was so much about the writings but just knowing she was still very much hung up on Brad. When you‚Äôre married, if your spouse is still in love/hung up on their ex, it‚Äôs problematic.
She didn‚Äôt physically cheat YET but she most certainly cheated and orchestrated everything wrong that happened in the show
Did you watch the show at all? She went to go act on it about ten different times but got ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù a few times, or ‚Äúcame to her senses‚Äù as his tongue is shoved down her throat üòê 

Its not the issue of the journal just being there though.... regardless of who tf you are, if you‚Äôre now married with kids as of 8 years, and are dreaming so heavily of your ex you feel this need ti leave and cheat on your s.o.... thats a problem.
look up the definition of emotional cheating, just because a physical act isn't committed doesn't mean it's NOT being unfaithful. In many ways it's worse,
1&2) I kinda get his perspective. I had an ex that was still friends with her ex. Not super close but close enough that when she talked about him or I saw her chat with him on the phone it would make me raise an eyebrow. Unlike cooper I was pretty straight forward in asking if she still had feelings for him, she said no but I never really believed her (for a little context it‚Äôs unclear who broke it off but it came to an end when she found out he was fooling around with other girls but her understanding was that they were only seeing each other or something; either way she was hurt but they stayed friends‚Ä¶). She was also pretty sexually active before we met. More than me I think. Both of those things sometimes made me feel insecure and I would take on risky behavior just to prove something like we see cooper doing. Did I have have some kind of weird Madonna complex about her? Not really. People are sexual and all that, but it did bother me to think about everything they may have done together because I felt like she still had feelings for him. I think there was a part of me that wanted to sort of overwrite her past experiences and prove I can be thrilling in that way too. I don‚Äôt think cooper couldn‚Äôt do those things with her so much as it is that he just doesn‚Äôt want to. That‚Äôs not the kind of guy he is but he feels like he should be to satisfy her. 

Fortunately we didn‚Äôt have much issue in the sex department, but if I was ever regaled with tales of how he used to fuck her and tried to emulate only for her to give me instructions and it not quite go right, I‚Äôd probably be frustrated too. I would hate to be in any situation where I felt like I was inevitably being compared to my partner‚Äôs ex.

3) lol they are both acting like children considering how educated they‚Äôre implied to be. I‚Äôm still not sure how either of them didn‚Äôt think anything of Brad completely violating Sasha‚Äôs privacy and FaceTiming their fuck session to Billie or why the hell Sasha went along with Billie to try and actually fucking gaslight Cooper.
üíØ
The whole plot is kicked off by Cooper reading her journal, which is never addressed really for how fucked up it is. She can fantasize all she wants, but had he never read it and gotten all pissy about the fact that he sucks in bed none of anything would have happened. Likely she‚Äôd have worked through it internally or with her friends and there‚Äôd be no show, she‚Äôs always the one trying to save the marriage. The only mistake she made was sacrificing good sex for stability, obviously Cooper was never good in bed. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting a good sex life. 

you do realize all those scenes you mentioned of sex with Brad were flashbacks, not her actually cheating, right? Cooper is the douchebag responsible for everything. Don‚Äôt read someone‚Äôs private journal. People are entitled to their own private thoughts. 

it doesn‚Äôt matter that Cooper thought he was trying to ‚Äôhelp‚Äô the marriage by taking her to a swingers party - she said no, she wasn‚Äôt comfortable, and he kept pushing her. That was close to a SA scene And then he let his friend‚Äôs wife give him a blow job in front of her? Cruel. He‚Äôs an insecure jackass.
yeah that was pretty horrifying. the second she said ‚Äúno‚Äù once and then the whole thing continue, let alone the fact that she straight up said ‚Äúno no no no no no i don‚Äôt want this‚Äù like wtf?! how did that fly when writing this. 

and also the whole scene was so unnecessarily demonizing of swingers and poly people. and i‚Äôm not even a poly person i‚Äôm vanilla af and i still was like ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not right‚Äù and mad about it hahaha
What happened?
Hudson looks exactly like my husband as a small boy.  I am with you 100%.  I think I‚Äôm now watching the show for his sweet little being.
I really hated that part because the idiot friends should never have surprised them with the lifestyle party. That is not something you should be surprised with and not have discussions about boundaries, rules, etc. The minute it was obvious she wasn't comfortable,  he should have stopped. She said no, but he kept going. Same thing earlier in the season when he fucked her on the kitchen island. She was saying stop, but he kept going. It was a very hateful exchange.
Yeah that episode was so messed up. I felt bad for Cooper up until that whole swingers party and what he did to her. After that I would've been like forget you buddy. I'm gonna go find Brad.
So consider you have an ex who is treated you like shit, threw you out of their apartment after cheating on you, wasn‚Äôt there when you needed them the most, but was good in sex. Then you have you current partner who loves you the most, take care of you, puts you above everything else, comes home every night to you, who is always their for your children, but not good in sex and they don‚Äôt know because you never mention it. Your ex comes back and says they have changed and want you back. Will you still leave your partner who respects and love you and your children the most?
man, you guys really need to get an understanding of how shit works.
Currently? So you find nothing wrong with him FaceTiming his currently married ex to show her his dick or, even better, calling her from her best friends phone then putting it on FaceTime so she could watch them fuck? And that‚Äôs AFTER he‚Äôs ‚Äúchanged‚Äù I mean what the fuck.


Cooper has his flaws but Brad is the ultimate manipulative psycho
Dang these hoes becomin more stupid everyday day ü§î
You legit sound insane‚Ä¶ like we truly have people walking around thinking Brad, the asshole who starts sleeping with the woman he‚Äôs ‚Äúin love with for 8 years‚Äù BEST friend for over a year and a half is better than Cooper.

Calls the married woman he‚Äôs ‚Äúin love with‚Äù in the middle of the night. Texts her. Calls from her BEST FRIEND‚ÄôS PHONE and FaceTimes their sex without consent (which is very illegal by the way), FaceTimes her again to show his dick off, pretends he‚Äôs dating said best friend and then starts completely disrespecting everyone at the table by talking about he and his ex ‚Äúwearing nothing‚Äù the whole time while on a sex vacation years ago, disrespects her husband‚Äôs career numerous times unwarranted, then follows her into the women‚Äôs room and locks the door trying to convince her she‚Äôs in love with him??? The man is so fucking unhinged he drove her home and wanted to see her CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT HIS. 

Not to mention the entire reason they aren‚Äôt together is because of the mountain of shit he did in the past, most recent being sleeping with another woman and then throwing BILLIE out over it. 

The man has been and will ALWAYS be nuts. He‚Äôs obsessed with having Billie and doesn‚Äôt care if he blows up her friendships, marriage, family, well-being over it. He only cares about himself. He‚Äôs a narcissist to core and genuinely terrifying in that he will not stop until he gets what he wants. 

Cooper‚Äôs biggest crime is not paying enough attention during sex and reading a goddamn journal she left open on the kitchen counter with no password. Is it wrong? Yes. But the man has proven many times he wants to make her happy and if he can‚Äôt then she should be with someone who can. If you can‚Äôt see that HE is the healthy choice then you need more help than Billie.
Your opinion is complete codswallop. What‚Äôs your age?
Paige from degrassi had me rolling. Glad she's still acting but man, this role was no where near Paige iconic
‚ÄúPaige from Degrassi‚Äù üòÇüòÇ omg! I knew I recognized her. And also yes I agree with everything you just said!!
I feel bad for hating on a kid but wow that child actor was bad
Your comment is EXACTLY how I felt watching this show. A train wreck that I just continued to watch ü§£. Usually, in a show, there‚Äôs atleast ONE person to root for, but this show? Nope. In the end, they ALL JUST SUCK.
I hated Cooper from the beginning because he didnt wanna fuck his hot wife and started watching football while fingering her, and she was under the impression they were experiencing something together.
It‚Äôs like a train wreck you‚Äôre mortified but can‚Äôt look away!
I met my Brad. This show resonated with me in so many ways after experiencing a Brad of my own. I totally got where she was coming from. I still think about the ways he touched me. Sure, I settled down and married a nice gal whom I love very much. But no one will ever fuck me the way he did.
AMEN. This show had me reflecting on my brad(s) and it made me sick to my stomach.
Well I agree what you say it‚Äôs easy for people who have not met their ‚ÄòBrad‚Äô won‚Äôt understand about the desire and need. But on other hand the ‚ÄòBrad‚Äô is a toxic guy who will threw you to your lowest.

When you‚Äôre in your 30‚Äôs you can‚Äôt behave in a way you behaved with your ‚ÄòBrad‚Äô. You need to think about your kids welfare and other aspects of life like financial management or taking care of your health and your loved ones. I agree that the desire and need will come back again to you at that point you can‚Äôt go and meet your ex when your partner knows that you‚Äôre fantasizing about your ex. Your partner will suspect that you are cheating on them and it‚Äôs not a trust it‚Äôs human nature of having a doubt about this.

One of the important aspect of the relationship is communication that most people don‚Äôt follow. If your desire and needs come back you can have a proper communication with your partner if that doesn‚Äôt help we have counseling that can help you guys.

In 85-15% thing it‚Äôs up to a person what they prefer to choose. If they are getting 100% it‚Äôs well and good if your partner is lacking in some parts and not able to give you 100% then you can have a transparent communication or a couple counseling sessions or something like that you can attend and try to achieve your 100%.
This is kinda sad‚Ä¶
I just kept thinking of all the stuck toilet paper fuzzies. Ya gotta give a girl a chance to freshen up!
awww, i feel bad for you i hope you don't really think this? every guy except maybe a few i've been with were VERY quick to go down on me if we were getting intimate. i'm talking like we are making out on a bed and they immediately rip off whatever i'm wearing and do it. and these weren't like guys doing it to angle for me returning the favor, i just think they loved getting a girl to moan and stuff. damn maybe i actually have a good "picker" lol
Lmao yeah that specific part had me roll my eyes. Because what guy is going to STOP 2 minutes into an epic bj and be like ..yeah nvm let me go down instead ? üòÇ. I agree with the replies that guys are willing, but unless it‚Äôs their ‚Äúthing‚Äù , they‚Äôre probably not THAT pressed to do it
Damn who wants to tell her she dating immature-ass men üòÇüòÇ

That or your pussy stank
I hope so hopefully he‚Äôs moved on I feel like after his talk with cooper he might have gained a new respect for him and the marriage. Probably not tho lol
My thoughts exactly! What about HIS feelings, anyone?! Brad should be the ultimate choice but we'll see. These shows are too afraid to break a marriage and have her go for the other guy.
God damn right and it ain‚Äôt bad but gotta be real. Honesty and communication is key.

I learnt from a wise guy to believe people when they show you who they are. He should have accepted reality and moved on asap because that shit never gets better. Drama is expensive.
I think the premise of saving documents, pictures etc. under a bogus file name is quite clever.  Although my ex did that with his retarded whore and I found all their pictures easily.   Clever, but not clever enough for me because I found them.  It's been 7 years and I'm still pissed about it. Oh well......
the entire series was a plot fail, too many single moment triggers that if removed, the house of cards would not have fallen. it was embarrassingly shallow and void of any depth.
She should have done her own psychological analysis for her PhD research.

Boi, what a treat that would have been.
Billie is the WORST human being I‚Äôve ever seen on a TV show. Absolute POS
cooper literally got his dick sucked in front of his crying wife, & i‚Äôm pretty sure cooper was the only one finishing in that marriage
Agree with you. I'll marry Cooper! Lol
She whispers all the time
She looks like Fiona from shameless
Agreed.  While watching last night, I kept thinking "dang, she's really good at crying".
It was all sooo heart wrenching. She's a great actress.
Actually, it did and Sasha complemented Billie on developing a new way to manipulate her husband. People forget, when using this as an example of how awful Cooper was, that she arguably intentionally set this in motion. Of course, she didn‚Äôt want him to continue to read it, but that was after she opened Pandora‚Äôs box and things started to get out of control. While maybe he should have stopped, she was also lying to him with great regularity at this point, and while problematic, I get why he continued to read it. She sure wasn‚Äôt going to be honest with him to his face unless he called her on her lies, which he did many times.
No.

Marriage is the promise to commit to the other person, forsaking all others. By doing that, you choose to make the best of life together, working through the bad times, and enjoying the good times together. If you don‚Äôt understand that, don‚Äôt get married. But if you do get married, stick to your word.

And if you just cannot bear it any longer, be open about it and either Separate and Divorce, or agree to open your marriage. (Bad idea). Just don‚Äôt be the kind of person entertaining adultery. It‚Äôs completely selfish, scumbag behaviour.

Cheaters are the worst.
I find Brad to be so unattractive. He looks like the type of guy who doesn‚Äôt shower every day. He looks like he has BO and bad breath. His d*ick was so hyped and when I saw it, it reminded me of a sad Snuffleapagus. I get that it‚Äôs flaccid, but it‚Äôs just not pleasant looking even for a softie. 

I don‚Äôt find Cooper attractive, either, but he is at least more attractive than Brad.
I agree so much!  Cooper is an overgrown frat brat and Brad is not that hot to be the playboy.
I think when she says ‚ÄúI can have it all,‚Äù she means that she can have both Cooper and Brad. Which leads me to think that they had agreed upon an ‚Äúopen‚Äù relationship. That‚Äôs why Brad also called Francesca. I believe also that in an open relationship, some partners will choose to have their locations on in case something goes wrong at the other‚Äôs hookups. Just an idea.
I think it was what Trina said in addition to Sasha‚Äôs presentation on ‚Äúthe third way.‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt think they agreed to an open relationship because his body language is completely off when he tracks her. I think he calls Francesca more for comfort since she is removed from the situation, but knows about what‚Äôs going on.
She went to school for psychology, I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt think of wanting to seek marriage counseling? Or maybe her own personal counseling for potential PPD?
I agree with the point that it glorifies cheating. I also think it had a political agenda in regards to open relationships.
Billie is caught between a deep familial love for Cooper but a sexual love for Brad. She can‚Äôt choose so she chooses the ‚Äúthird way‚Äù (described by Sasha as the path that you choose for yourself and for nobody else and your partners acceptance of that) 

I feel like the introduction of this ‚Äúthird way‚Äù as well as the point that Trina makes of ‚ÄúI hope it‚Äôs enough‚Äù shows the focus moving towards open relationships.

There is also another point where Billie‚Äôs psychology friends at dinner point out that she‚Äôs the only champion among them for monogamy, and then she goes and seeks help from that same friend (Summer), showing her interest in his stance on Monogamy/polyamory.
no apparently the reason the show exists is to explore sexuality from a "female lens" because apparently ALL the romantic comedies are seen through the "male lens".....apparently. 

Some PR puff there that's for sure.
"She's a psychologist with a gorgeous husband who is great with her kids, has money, and loves her deeply...and she risks fucking it all up because she's horny for a cliche in a leather jacket? Her thought wasn't to just get sex therapy and/or be open about what she wanted?"

The reason this show exists is to show people like you that this üî∫Ô∏è is bullshit! Do you really think that a good looking husband, marriage, kids, a white picket fence equal happiness?? That marriage equals love?? That marriage with the aforementioned equals happiness?? That very mindset IS the problem! It is the very reason this show exists.
Hahahahahaha best response yet hahahaha
LMAO THAT NIGHTGOWN! And *hugs* I felt what you meant about the love of your life coming back a changed man. My ex husband was my BOOM romance but it was so toxic and I finally gave up hope of him ever changing but damn.. those feeling tho. They hit HARD at times.
I don‚Äôt think Cooper was all that great of a guy.  I think he wanted a trophy wife and was shocked to find she had feelings and a history which he never asked about in 8 years?
chuckled at the use of the word stain
She never mentioned what she did while watching the FaceTime, just that she watched and saw all of it. A rather convenient omission.
Omg yes! ,finally someone mentions it.

Either he has a problem or he doesn‚Äôt find Billie attractive anymore
Agreed. And Brad's delivery just gets flatter as the show progresses, almost like he can't believe he's actually having to deliver these lines.
neither was the lens or lighting choices. when you see makeup in closeups caked into pours, it's not a good thing
I thought Billie was the strongest actor on the show
Well it ends horribly. So get ready.
Yeah that part made me really mad that her best friend was hooking up with her ex for a year behind her back. Some friend. I could see if they weren't serious but he was the love of her life.
Sasha annoyed the hell out of me with that.  Honestly reminded me of a personal friend of mine, like my BEST friend, who made out with a guy I was seeing, apologized but continued to hang out with him one-on-one all while I was trying to preserve the friendship.  Also during this time she slept with two of our mutual friend's exes.  Like it was more important to her to know that guys wanted her sexually than to care about her friends.  It happened over a decade ago and I do believe she is a different and better person now, but I'll never forget and things just can't ever be the same after that.  That's what Sasha reminded me of.
I'm in the same boat. I felt like this show was a mirror image of my marriage and what I'm going through. I don't miss my exes, but I do miss my old life. 

It's been a challenge learning to feel content with that 85% and trying to find constructive, healthy ways to deal with the missing 15%. Supposedly it'll all be worth it..and all the sacrifices will amount to something good.
[removed]
The show has helped me too. In my own life there‚Äôs a guy I still think about, and I often feel bad about the fact that I do because of the circumstances surrounding the relationship. In spite of the odds, he and I dove in headfirst. 

Me and this guy were only together three months in 2020, but neither of us forgot the relationship. He messaged me as recent as a few months ago, after over a year hiatus. Told me he was single again. Told me he still loved me. Then disappeared into thin air again. It‚Äôll never happen for us, but I think about it, and I take comfort in the fact he does too. 

This show reminds me that we are all humans with complicated emotions, situations are nuanced, and relationships are not black and white. And I don‚Äôt feel so wrong, I recognize I just want that intensity back. I hope one day I‚Äôll find it again. 

The men in this story are not innocent either. Billie is not a villain. All the people saying that are giving me incel vibes honestly. Or pick me girl vibes. Or old conservative vibes. 

There are other catalysts in her story. ‚Ä¶ Like this fucking idiot Brad standing outside her family home at night with a ring for her even though she‚Äôs married (in episode seven- which I‚Äôm currently watching). üòÇ
If you are fantasising that much about someone else, the relationship is dead in the water.
Okay. I'm tired of this "safe choice" narrative. There is no "safe choice"! The best choice is the person who is IN LOVE with you! Not loves you very much, not likes you, not complements you etc. Is IN LOVE with you. That is the best choice. Because the safe bet isn't really safe if they are actually not in love. What if the love of their life shows up?? More passionate, more intense. Are you safe then??
That‚Äôs really all it is. It shows that the way we try to normalize the ‚Äúhoe phase‚Äù nowadays doesn‚Äôt come without consequences. Her and Sasha are two beautiful and intelligent women that won‚Äôt ever be able to settle down because they got too involved in that life.

It just goes to show that if (traditional) marriage is something you value and is one of your goals, you should not live a promiscuous life. And if you do, it should not be prolonged
do u have any idea what u are saying ? copper is not trying ? from the first ep he just keep trying to get his marriage back , take her on dates and do stuff that her wife wanted.   
copper didnt think she was a sex crazy slut , audience thinks that bcz she is a sex crazy slut how it is shown in series. copper let her be how she wanted and didnt judge her and just tried to do what she wanted , that excitement

copper fucked her in anger bcz thats the kind of sex she wrote in her diary ... and even she be like yes this is what she wanted but it didnt last long.   
u are saying copper wasnt willing to talk about it ? idk if we are seeing the same show now.

she was wanted in the marriage. that dude left her when she was pregnant , that dude cheated on her , he keep being mean to her in past relationship and that dude make her feel wanted ?? wow   
I hate billie's character
>pasty blonde blue eyed children

Do you know what Persians look like? Lol. They're really diverse and are capable of having any eye color.
She drinks a lot for someone who is suppose to be breastfeeding. Its kind of intense
Amen! He totally wasn't into her.
Hudson, that little shit reminded me of the son in the shining, he was creepy as hell and has some croaky ass voice ü§£
The man GAVE her everything? Lol I don't even know where to begin! And I'm saying this with no clue of your gender, so don't come back at me!
Do you even know what marriage is? He isn't giving her anything that she isn't giving back! They decided that they wanted a family of two kids. And stay at home mom is a really important and toughest part to execute. You can't swear around kids but all that Cooper could have done was yell slurs at work for what it's worth. And as per the storyline, he wasn't even looking at her or basically, communicating.
I don't say the actions are justified on billie's end but seriously! What if the tables were to turn? What if the wife would give him EVERYTHING and that ONE thing he cant ha e was gonna destroy their family? Oh wait, isn't that every other story we have always seen?
And also, don't say EVERYTHING and two words later mention the one thing she can't have... news flash! She couldn't have it coz he wasn't giving or letting her have it! Everything is all encompassing! It's not SOMETHING!
SERIOUSLY i was watching like ok when are we gonna see anything other than sex so i can understand why she‚Äôs so in love?? and then all we got was scenes of how awful he was, and a slapped together story about his daddy issues in an attempt to pretend they have an emotional connection üòÇ
True. But girls really do romanticize toxic relationships. It's so common.
I read a comment by the show-runner that the Brad sex was supposed to look highly fantasized. I think she was implying that the new sex with Brad may not live up to the memories of past sex. This suggests to me that Billie and Brad do connect, and I think she will open her emotions to him to try to get that past thrill. That will end her relationship with Cooper. She‚Äôll then discover that Brad didn‚Äôt change and that she needs security he can‚Äôt provide. She‚Äôll leave him, Cooper will have moved on, and she‚Äôll find security in herself and, to paraphrase Billie, ‚Äúhappily Ho herself through the other half of Manhatten‚Äù thus living her 100%
Agreed. And on the suburban housewives‚Ä¶ they could have explored a bit more how they dealt with their marriages difficulties ‚Äî everybody has them! That could have been interesting. But if even the protagonists are so shallow as they are, one would be expecting way too much to get some meaning out of the supporting ladies in waiting.
White Future ü§£ü§£ü§£ the way Brad croaked and told his sob stories about his dad made me want to punch the screen every time
But she did cheat already imo lol Cooper doesn‚Äôt even know that she watched them have sex masturbated to it looked at him undress on ft sneaking him in the house to look at his kids etc she is very much like that
It def seemed like an agreement to me!
I don‚Äôt think this is likely because Francesca‚Äôs character is obviously interested in cooper for something long term. Her character doesn‚Äôt seem like the type to compromise on that. And I‚Äôd find it very unlikely that Cooper would do all this just to let his wife get fucked by Brad anyway, that‚Äôd kind of trivialize the entire arc. 

Also Billie absolutely would cheat. Brad never told Cooper about how he was literally going to take billy home (the night she met him at the art gallery), and the only thing that got in the way was a well timed (or poorly timed) text. She spent all that time with him and completely forgot she had kids, then she went home and lied about where she was. Even without that, watching the ex that you‚Äôve been reminiscing about as they fuck your best friend and letting them FaceTime you their dick is definitely cheating on some level in a lot of peoples books.
I think you nailed it. There were many times where one of them didn‚Äôt know where the other was and were worried. Why all of a sudden the ability to track? Because they opened up sexually and wanted the security of the other knowing.
I disagree about cooper I felt he was betrayed and shocked learning about how his wife really is and instead of talking about what she wanted she lied and gaslighted him the whole show while carrying out a emotional affair. She lied about the type of person she was and I feel cooper was grasping at straws desperately trying to make her happy and she is just greedy poor guy honestly
This is an awful awful take
Cooper had all the righy to be angry and treat her like shit. Brad changing doesnt matter; she was already taken. Weird take
you need help
Literally NO communication between Billie and cooper. 

Also I was screaming LIMITS when they went to the sex party. NO ONE goes into something like that‚Äôs without discussing it first, nor would another couple bring them into it knowing they were jumping into it head first with no discussions.
I breastfed. My nipples were never as long as hers lol
she has great tits
[removed]
Omg YES üòÇüòÇ for an actress that‚Äôs topless a lot her boobs are pretty ugly. Those nipples ugh ü§¢
Haven‚Äôt read the other comments yet, but absolutely agree!!!!
I was really really annoyed that they are psychologists and NEVER mentioned PPD in that show.
I agree with most of what you say.

Cooper wasn‚Äôt the perfect husband. He was emotionally unavailable at times, and more invested in the football and work than his wife. That‚Äôs not the way to sustain a long term marriage.

But the solution to fixing a problem in your marriage is NOT to go outside the marriage.

I had hopes in the last episode that Billie might have realised marriage is what you make of it, but alas. That‚Äôs not good TV. The writers/producers needed her to run back to Brad so that they could write another season. So let‚Äôs just pretend it‚Äôs better to be ‚Äútrue to yourself‚Äù rather than have a moral code.
The car scene really bothered me too, it‚Äôs definitely real but I feel like Netflix shouldn‚Äôt be promoting that, married or not if it‚Äôs not a hell yes it‚Äôs a no when it comes to sex.
All men have flaws. I think the bigger point is being missed. No man in this day and age can be as they are....men can't not be on their square 24/7. Gone are the days where you can come home as a man and rest without someone needing you for something. If the need isn't addressed then you risk your whole home as a man being in shambles. The standards for men are IMPOSSIBLE these days, and the same for women too. But it's not about women right now. Men are expected to bring home high value salaries, get the big luxurious homes, come home be a parent and sexually be superman. Wake up and do it again. Forgoing any interest that they might have be it football etc. For the family and work so the woman can either stay home and be taken care of or go to work and stack her money and hopefully she will use the money for the family (if she deems it appropriate). It's too much, let's keep in mind the statistics of how much a family needs etc for retirement and living as they were living. He was a high value man. 


Not only was he a high value man but he was a good high value man, a FAITHFUL high value man. This show showed perfectly that being faithful as a high value man with a woman is not rewarded. I'm more surprised women didn't rise up against this show because if faithfulness, and a high value man is truly what women want, this show just shot that all to hell. It's not enough to be the Cooper, hell....it may not even be enough to be the Brad. Remember she was only thinking about Brad because Cooper was off his sexual game. He got comfortable with his life. The big picture is with this show from the standpoint of Cooper, don't trust women, you can't let your guard down and get comfortable, you have to be on your square at all times. The world is not your friend, even your wife isn't truly on your side. Literally what the show was saying for Cooper.
I kept asking myself that same question. Why isn‚Äôt she seeking counseling, but then I figured perhaps journaling could be her preferred choice. There‚Äôs no communication from either party. She feels lonely and unsatisfied, yet she remains silent and only expresses her unhappiness on paper. He senses something is up with her instead of talking to her and being present for her, he snoops and invades her privacy. Life is built on choices neither party is making the best choices for their marriage/family. IMO Billy both emotionally and physically cheated on Cooper. Cooper is responsible for opening Pandora‚Äôs box by reading her journal. He wasn‚Äôt prepared for what he found in that laptop
Brad staring off into space intently Zoolander style while the singer was recording in the studio killedddd me. He‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs good üòÇ
Brad is ‚Äúborderline‚Äù abusive? Guy literally FaceTimed Billie while fucking her best friend just to prove some kind of point. Completely violating Sasha‚Äôs privacy at the same time. Then he loc ks himself in the bathroom with her at the dinner with Cooper. Dude is a psychopath.
They would have fucked right in front of the crib if Brad kissed her. It was sooooooo disrespectful and wayyy past the line
Because he had a meeting with the HR people and didn't tell them that Cooper beat him up so he appreciated that.
yeah, that conflict had no resolution and just got solved in 2 minutes with cut scenes.
Honestly she's a cheating asshole and basically admitted she's selfish and doesn't care at the end
fun fact : in the show she was a psychologist , so she was therapist herself, if she completed degree.
Right? There‚Äôs a way to be sexually liberated without being destructive and hurtful to others!
Also they try to show Brad as the leather jacket wearing "bad boy", but he comes more across as a simp. Come on, dude. He is a succesfull music producer. He can have any young, hot piece of ass woman he wants. And yet he's Hellbent on getting his ex back who is married with two kids. An ex that he cheated on and broke up with, after she had a miscarriage.
Hard to be In the mood when your wife is cheating on u
yah francesca is a baddie, although now that i think about it she‚Äôs too good for cooper lol
You're right.  This is the way it comes off. I think they were trying to make a sex positive show about losing the person you were and want to remain and how does that work when you're in the next phase of life.  The producers have just delivered an angst filled contribed romance novel.
That‚Äôs literally what I‚Äôm getting from this show I‚Äôm trying soo hard to like it but the mom is soo annoying
They do all suck, I agree. But Cooper's head literally would have been fucked up from what he didn't know about his wife and what she was fantasising about. Yes, they both obviously didn't communicate and he wasn't pleasing her - but finding all that out at once, wow.

He did a lot wrong but in a way was trying to give his wife what he thought she wanted (through his fucked mind).

It was a shame at the end that he seemed to be trying hard and taking more notice of her, and her to him/his body. Only for the ending to go back to square one.

They are all shit, and now will be using Brad if he accepts. I hate him too. Lol.
Yes, finally. I feel like I've been taking silly pills. Like Cooper violated his wife's privacy. Her writing fanfiction is not an excuse to get head from your best friend's wife. I feel like consent is something that needs to be discussed because Cooper is constantly stepping over boundaries. With the diary, both sex scenes where she asked him to slow down and he kept going when they started kissing at the sex party (she wanted to go home and vocalized it, he ignored her and kept pushing until she finally stepped back where he then got head from BFW). I can't believe people are defending that.
Lol the fact that ur blaming cooper for Billie cheating is insane how come after 8 years she still has his number saved ? A simple block and this whole triangle is resolved but she couldn‚Äôt do it why are u fantasizing about a ex anyway ? I get old flings maybe but they were all about Brad and obviously she isn‚Äôt over him. Sneaking around to take calls and text and watching him have sex on ft while masturbating to it is definitely cheating she even snuck him into the house to look at coopers and her kids to think about what they could have had smh they are scum
I absolutely agree with this unpopular opinion
100 percent agreed !
Yess I agree too! Cooper just kept adding more marks to his record as it went on and Billie never physically did anything. I was even getting upset that she kept blaming herself for his actions. His \[re\]actions are his own!
I know.. I feel like I need to visit Connecticut, as this Stepford stereotype plays out in so many shows üòÇ
I jokingly mocked the scene and said that before he did then died when it happened. üíÄ
i haaaated that whole scene and was cringing the whole time, but him saying ‚ÄúDO IT üò°‚Äù made me bust out laughing hahahaha like what
This. That friend knew everything that man put her through and how he hurt her, so for her to then go and betray that friendship and sleep with him a good number of times for over the course of a year‚Ä¶.inexcusable. I couldn‚Äôt forgive that.
Yes, THIS. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with Brad but damn did I HATE Cooper and Billie together. The ending sucked because honestly at that point Cooper was dead to me. He just fucking sucked from beginning to end. I wish she just ended up with Brad because honestly I think that is where she would be the happiest BUT only if he truly did change. Which lets be honest who really knows on that one, he had A LOT of abusive tendency‚Äôs that just don‚Äôt go away sometimes. Overall I don‚Äôt know, but my final thoughts are Cooper needs to go and Brad can stay.
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.
Here's a copy of

The last bullet point üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
I completely agree with all of this!!!
I have this theory too...probably bc I can relate üòÇ
And his stupid slack jaw face‚Ä¶
Hahaha! ikr...sbdy buy that man some chapstick!
Right I wonder sometimes it makes my priorities look fucked up but I really can‚Äôt get over him reading her journal! And the fact that he seems SO UNINTERESTED in having sex with her until he reads it. Like wtf! I‚Äôm a grudge holder I would be like ‚Äúnah don‚Äôt worry about it! I‚Äôm good!‚Äù Point to my head and walk away lol
[deleted]
Spoken like a true modern woman... congrats on successfully checking off all the boxes. üëè
I totally agree! This was me too...I was like no....don't go back to the toxic ex, no matter how good the sex was....I mean what terrible choices she had...between 2 good looking rich men, one a bit of an asshole and the other husband material...like what the?
I felt like they didn‚Äôt do a good job as portraying her as a ‚Äúmom‚Äù if that makes sense. Like her character just never took on the mom role. Towards the end I felt like it did a little bit but throughout the whole series I was like lady! Why are you leaving your kids?!
i starting loling at how often she called someone to come babysit last min, it was several times an episode
I actually thought billies body was realistic, yes she‚Äôs thin and in great shape but there are many scenes were you can see her postpartum belly and the loose skin, that wasn‚Äôt air brushed. Which I appreciated. 

I hated sashas character, the actress was stunning and did a good job but of course the black girl is given the stereotypical side kick role with way too many ‚Äúumm girrrrrlll‚Äù lines... they could have done so much more with her.
Sarah Shahi gave birth to twins in early 2015 and was back to top shape just a few months later through hard work at the gym. It is possible.
Sadly me too because I have had such a crush on the actress since Fairly Legal!
Yes she was and I could not get past it
I wondered if the past is actually our present and their present is our future. Reason: when Billie first meets Cooper and sees him at the recruiting event on campus, he speaks about Bezos and Musk. I feel like they weren‚Äôt as prominent or as wealthy as they would have been about 7-8 years ago.
[deleted]
I stopped watching mid-episode 6 because I knew she wasn‚Äôt staying with Cooper and I was done. You‚Äôre 100% right that Brad hasn‚Äôt changed look how he gaslit her and manipulated her by calling and texting when she said not to and by literally fucking her friend while she watched. 

I am pissed because i hate stuff like this that has kids involved and it‚Äôs like the entire point of the little boy was to make the most obvious foreshadowing that she was going to leave. Is she planning on coparenting while breast feeding? Does she think BRAD is a good influence for her children? Did she think about what she‚Äôd be putting them through?


I came to this show as a reader of romance novels expecting it to be like one of the steamier books in  the genre, but this is definitely not a happily ever after. Hell it‚Äôs not even a happy for now. It‚Äôs a manipulative person fucking up a good and stable marriage that had more of a chance than she deserved. 


You were absolutely right though... good communication and therapy would change everything.
I have been married 11 years.  I will say married sex waxes and wanes.  Part of that may just be getting older.  Other life stuff that comes up and so on.  Some might just be being with the same person I don't know because I have nothing to compare it to since you know you can't be married and single at the same time to compare sex activity.  

Anyways I think the thing is checking in with each other.  If one of you is having a lower libido time (and with my husband and I it has switched from.one lof us to the other at times so I have experienced it from both side) you need to talk.  You need to talk and come up with a compromise.  For us it started at making sure we have sex once a week regularly again.   Then trying to up that up to two.  We have tried to spice it up with toys, porn, long foreplay (football Saturdays are amazing for this if you are alone).  


It isn't sexy to feel like you are on a schedule or okay it is Friday and we haven't had sex yet this week.  But it keeps that physical intimacy intact so that part doesn't deteotiate more and affect other areas of your marriage.  What the compromise looked like is different for everyone.  Some people decide to try an open marriage with rules.  Some try the sex parties like seen in the movie.  But the important part is to have that talk and plan and do check ins just like you do to make sure financially you are on track

But like someone else said below it doesn't work if both partners don't put in the effort. I also wouldn't necessarily have this talk in the throws or expect sex after it.  But is good to know what you are moving towards like okay I agree to have spontaneous sex once a week.  What that looks like will be different each week.  But then don't expect it that day.  However again for the partner doesn't hold that agreement up then it is a bigger issue.
I‚Äôm 26 and have been married for 5 years. My husband is the only person I‚Äôve been with sexually. We have two kids just like in the show. I can‚Äôt lie and say things don‚Äôt get a little mundane and routine But, that is just part of being married with kids. HOWEVER, I believe you can have both. My husband and I have always been open to trying things, keeping the romance alive. Monogamy doesn‚Äôt equal boring. It‚Äôs what you put in that you get out. Even after 5 years of marriage, 8 years together total, and two kids.. the passion is definitely still there.
I think once you're married and settled, you desire being "younger and sexier" in the same way that you desire being in love and married when you are younger...if that makes sense. Sure you always have the what if thoughts, but what you have it pretty good either way. So, no. This show and that psycho Billie is not an accurate depiction of grown, married women/mothers.
Agreed on all points. Also the irony of two psychology professionals (well 1 I guess) trying to literally gaslight ones husband when he starts catching on is absurd. And yet it‚Äôs never brought up again. That should have single handedly been the end of their marriage.

And is it cool now to have your ex FaceTime you a fuck session of railing your best friend, a complete violation of her privacy, without any consent? Like wtf? How was he not trashed right then? And this is him after he ‚Äúworked on himself‚Äù? 

I genuinely do think media like this is dangerous cuz it‚Äôs fully possible for young men and women to find things like this and have a warped view and understand of what a healthy relationship is.
Sir its an adult show üòê If it was only naked women y‚Äôall would have no problems with it. 
Not that it mattered but personally, I think it was nice that they did visuals more for the women than the men in a show for once
I don‚Äôt think it glorified it, maybe kind of at the very end but it showed the true nature behind it
[deleted]
Lmao fucking accurate
Sasha shouldn‚Äôt have invited Billie to the book event at that point. I feel like you as a psychologist and her BFF should know she‚Äôd literally take that and run with it
I thought more of a wannabe kardashian tbh
She remind me of the lead female in Imposters
No. She reminds me of shania Twain, circa 1990‚Äôs.
She reminds me so much of Vanessa Marcil (sp)?
I got really freaked out watching this show too because I could relate so deeply. I am not married but I did have 2 very similar relationships in my life, the latter being my angel-of-a-person ex who felt like home too. He was the sweetest man, but we ended things recently because something was just missing. While the other was someone from a 1 month old relationship that stayed on my mind for 3 years now. 

Nonetheless, I do feel frustrated at Billie at some point and wished she could be more decisive and cut things off. Another thing on my mind is this married couple needs goddam counselling and COMMUNICATION man!!
I relate to your comment so much!! I love my wife dearly and truly. But I miss and crave the raw passionate sex that came with my Brad. He also wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to settle down and create a family. I‚Äôm supposed to be with my wife and I love the life we are building.
If you‚Äôre questioning it before marriage the marriage won‚Äôt work without significant changes. That‚Äôs okay you might not be the end all be all. Just because he‚Äôs good doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs the only good person you‚Äôll ever know. HOWEVER. You will regret it and have a hard time getting past it unless you know you‚Äôve tried everything. You have to be truly at peace with whatever decision you make, but so should he.


The difference is that in the show she loves and wants everything she has with Cooper. It‚Äôs sounds like you might not love it all.
Please leave the poor guy and let him find someone who he makes happy as much as she makes him. If you already know this now it‚Äôs already headed for disaster
Yeah, because that‚Äôs where my attention was‚Ä¶ üôÑ
Nope. Got a new one. She unboxes it and everything.
‚ÄúLearning self control and discipline free you from being a slave to your desires‚Äù well said. Surprised Billie, being a PHD psychology student cant think critically for herself
No way. Production value is great, writing is entertaining, and the cast is beautiful. Maybe you don't like this kind of content, but it's perfect at what it set out to be. A guilty pleasure! Sexy, twisted, messy, and exciting! I loved it. And, I found it relatable. It wasn't made to be a high-art-prestigious-ground-breaking series. It was meant to be fun and sexy. Didn't take itself too seriously! I found myself laughing at a lot of the lines, and you could tell the cast had a great time!!
I have watched pornography with better plot.
Yeah‚Ä¶ any mom was just thinking, this dumb rich bitch doesn‚Äôt know how good she has it.
It was all unrealistic, the way she happened to walk into sashas apartment and Brad just happed to be there after they hooked up, considering she hadn‚Äôt seen him for years, it all felt too forced.
It's based on "44 chapters about 4 men" written by BB Easton.

Plenty of writing between. Read instead of watch
No she never acted in any of her impulses throughout the season, that's kind of the whole point. Then the ending left it open as to whether she was going to cave in with Brad or not. All the scenes between Brad and Billie were flashbacks, she never even kissed him during "present time"
In thinking more about this show, at it's most basic level it's a character study in can a good guy be bad and can a bad guy be good? Which one are you willing to give up?

The psychologist professor says something to the effect of you can't get thrill from someone who provides you security. It's the decision we all make with our partners. 

Personally, the thrill can't withstand day to day. It's draining. It doesn't mean you still don't crave it. I can relate to Billie in this way. Some days, you just can't stop think about the amazing physical connection. That trust you give over to someone.

That bond is so strong but so different than the one who provides security. I feel lucky that have had both. To have experienced both. 

With all that being said, I don't think a bad boy can provide security and I don't think the good guy can give you trill. Which is okay.
well in any case at least irl she was honest with herself and filed a divorce, which is different from the movie where she want both and cheats. People have the right to marry and divorce whenever they want.
Did you ever watch the L word? Her and Kat Moennig had the most INSANE CHEMISTRY! They(Carmen and Shane)  will always be my favorite couple even if they weren‚Äôt endgame
you lost me at sin
Twilight goes to Manhattan
Choose your partner(assuming u r single) carefully because your partner might expect loyalty from your end and this is gonna hurt him/her/they like motherfucker.
Tf lmao
Getting proper weak small dick cuckhold vibes here
Ok wow wall of text 

but I will respond to the beginning- Billie loved Cooper and felt safe and secure with him. It wasn‚Äôt a passionate love, but it was a good love. A safe bet. She settled in some ways. Most everyone settles. And some people get restless. It isn‚Äôt the far-fetched story you‚Äôre making it out to be, it‚Äôs a tale as old as time.
BEST RESPONSE
I will say, everyone has their own breaking point. When one person may recognize immediately that they don't want a certain trait in a person, another might take a while to get the courage or confidence to leave.
Right although I don‚Äôt share every sentiment of Billie‚Äôs, some of it hit me straight in my feels ESPECIALLY about how nobody really can prepare you for the shift into motherhood and how it engulfs you. My kids aren‚Äôt even babies anymore and I still have this sense of lost identity, though I love being their mother. I‚Äôm still me, I‚Äôm still someone else and I used to be fun. I used to have crazy nights and do really wild memorable shit and now I absolutely do not. So I felt that. As well as some other things for sure.

Interesting take but

>Few people get to marry the love of their life

This makes no sense, why do they marry if they're in love with someone else? Maybe they know they're getting old and want a family, but if you marry because of that of course it's gonna be a facade.

>what are the odds that he is in love too?? 

Love is a mutual thing. If it's unrequited it's not love it's just a mess
People just don't want to admit it. There's nothing wrong with enjoying it and thinking it's ridiculous at the same time. üòÇ
I hope he leaves Billie for Francesca.
There‚Äôs a reason for the sex scenes it‚Äôs not that deep it all adds up keep going it‚Äôs worth at least finishing the season
You can try to skip through them, by the end that‚Äôs what I did because I wanted to finish the plot but the volume and noises were too much
I think you‚Äôre spot on. I hated Billie from early on and found myself watching strictly because I wanted Cooper to get his. And he never does.

For some reason the writers are obsessed with cooper never changing and putting in this episodic look of ‚ÄúBillie you‚Äôve done something terrible agin‚Äù and by the end of the episode it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI still love you let keep trying‚Äù. That‚Äôs basically every episode after episode 3 or 4. The show could have been much better if they actually allowed his character to do something instead they make him some kind of wuss. I waffled in liking his best friend (Devon) as a character but he was absolutely right in the auditorium scene. Cooper should have left Billie for Francesca long before the last episode, but I think the writers would have no idea how to handle that and keep it interesting (though it really wouldn‚Äôt be that hard). 

Like you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs basically a soft core porn of the troped out bad boy versus nice guy schtick and that‚Äôs really all it has to offer and it doesn‚Äôt even do that convincingly. It reads like a woman‚Äôs literotica of a wife‚Äôs fantasy of cuckolding her husband. And while it tries to take itself seriously despite that it realizes that if it breaks that mold then it‚Äôll have nothing going. God forbid Cooper do that reasonable thing and leave the woman who TRIED TO FUCKING GASLIGHT HIM AT A DINNER WITH HER EX. No marriage would survive that, but the story demands that cooper be the incorrigible nice guy and so he perseveres and it‚Äôs never mentioned again. It‚Äôs really fucking absurd. I might have forgiven it if it ended with Cooper just leaving her and getting with Francesca.
I disagree with so much here, but first of all ‚Äì I wouldn't claim to have an informed opinion on something of which I skipped large parts.

Then ‚Äì I'm not American, so maybe that plays into it, but ‚Äì it baffled me how badly people still rag on divorce, something that is so massively common (and by the way a good thing). Yeah, I would have preferred they just split up and move on to co-parenting. Even an official decision on an open relationship, especially since Cooper admits early on that his sex drive just isn't very high, just any rational decision, but I guess the absence of that makes a lot of sense in that setting of suburgatory.
I do think a lot of it is messy, but so is life. And Netflix only giving out a max of eight episodes per season doesn't help with complex stories.
It‚Äôs horrible. I don‚Äôt know who it appeals to. Even if you looking for an erotic show to turn you on- this doesn‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs so incredibly un-sexy I have a hard time describing it.
[deleted]
Agree with all of this.
Cooper literally asked her if she wanted those things. She said yes and suggested leaving school and stuff. You don‚Äôt agree to a situation then start to resent your partner and not talk to them about it,, it‚Äôs  childish. 

Brad is gonna be as toxic as he always was when faced with real life. Instead of dealing with his abandonment issues and confronting his dad he just watched his dad die and said I‚Äôm cured and I‚Äôm now ready to be happy. He was verbally abusive and would throw things at her and clings on to ideas for happiness as opposed to trying to be truly happy. Brad is manipulative and selfish. Making his cheating on her after she had a miscarriage about him and his sob story instead of being truly sorry and not trying to make her feel bad for him like he always does
I feel like to Cooper‚Äôs defense, Billie‚Äôs writing was so graphic and he was blindsided by what he read. She never said anything to him about being unhappy and when he found out he did try to spice things up with her, but it still wasn‚Äôt enough (something usually got in the way) but he did try. And then he kept catching Billie in all those lies. Like okay, yes, he shouldn‚Äôt have slept over at Francescas, but he didn‚Äôt do anything with her and was honest about it.
I don‚Äôt blame him for that mental snap. Billie was being dishonest about A LOT and did hide a lot of other things. 
I do blame him for making Billie uncomfortable at the party with all those people watching, but in all honesty, would she have done things differently with Brad? Like I understand different people make you feel different ways, but if when you choose marry someone and have a family, shouldn‚Äôt you be more open? 
Idk just my thoughts
What gets me though is why was that scene of him masturbating to her phantasy just... Completely disregarded? It was fairly fucked up, and then just irrelevant?
Nah
Cooper can‚Äôt leave her because he needs to be a sexless foil for Brad. If he leaves the shows falls apart cuz the writers, I‚Äôm convinced, don‚Äôt know how to write anything else. 

Any reasonable man would have left Billie loooooong before episode 8. That gaslighting dinner with Sasha and Brad should‚Äôve been the real last straw. Instead they turn the last 4 or 5 episode don‚Äôt a loop of cooper finding out Billie did something awful so he‚Äôs mad, and then him turning around and telling her that he loves her anyway at the end. It‚Äôs so dumb.
It‚Äôs not. Don‚Äôt bother watching it.
At least finish the season it all adds up in the end but ofc they leave us with a major cliffhanger
Hi! I don‚Äôt know the exact brand but this Cavalli looks very similar: https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/just-cavalli-metallic-cropped-biker-jacket-item-16115531.aspx?fsb=1&size=19&storeid=10147&gbraid=0AAAAADsmKHQERsag4JZfZ0Bo0HpaNVAHC&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_keywordid=119356617&utm_shoppingproductid=16115531-5248&pid=google_search&af_channel=Search&c=2069920048&af_c_id=2069920048&af_siteid=&af_keywords=aud-360016540489:pla-387057359025&af_adset_id=75217627174&af_ad_id=204345266593&af_sub1=119356617&af_sub5=16115531-5248&is_retargeting=true&shopping=yes&gclid=CjwKCAjw_o-HBhAsEiwANqYhp7nVA7QUegS6Gu3za2Cmg4l2aIXbBdMilTz8No4pY0HXyj2PYXpvphoCFbcQAvD_BwE
lmao love this comment it‚Äôs so true

just so casually fucking everything up in suburbia
Lilith?
I was thinking it could be a stunt double, lol.
That‚Äôs why I had to rewind and rewatch!  üòÇ. My first thought was that it can‚Äôt be real.  But I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶looks pretty real.  I actually read an interview with the actor where he was asked about the scene and if he thinks there will be any reaction from viewers.  He said he didn‚Äôt know, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù.  No mention of a prosthetic‚Ä¶but that doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt.
Yeah, I totally forgot to mention him reading the journal which was egregious in my view. Definitely watch the last episode.  The ending is kind of good.
Yes I agree with you but instead of being isolated in housewives thoughts you can talk to your husband about your thoughts/needs and he will help you with it. But instead of that you go and cheat on your husband that‚Äôs not fair.
Yes,I agree and I def tried seeing it from that perspective mainly cuz I feel like I could relate to it, but I don‚Äôt know what it is, there‚Äôs just something about the writing in this show where watching it unfold was just not easy to follow which led it to be frustrating (IMO). Maybe it just bothered me that it all started with him reading her private thoughts in a journal like ISNT that the one thing that we have that‚Äôs we are allowed to keep private?.. and then the never wanting to talk about it from brad also irked me. I think I‚Äôm just reading too much into this but Im going to try to finish this last episode since I made it this far
All this show did was infantize Billie. All those classes she took but yet she‚Äôs not emotionally intelligent enough to properly communicate to her. 

With a nanny at home to keep up the house and watch the kids, the only thing that was stopping Billie from reaching her goal was Billie.
very rude for no reason, but okay let‚Äôs go with it! 

i‚Äôm not sure i know which instances you‚Äôre referring to when you say that she went to act on it 10 different times?? i don‚Äôt even remember them being alone together prior to the incident in the bathroom at their double date, but perhaps i‚Äôm forgetting something. 

i also think for the majority of the show the primary issue was that she *didn‚Äôt* want to cheat on her husband. to me that seemed like the central conflict.

anyway, this is a place for discussion so i think perhaps approaching a random person‚Äôs comment like it‚Äôs an argument is unnecessary.
Thank you so much for sharing your perspective. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of it like that (re 1 and 2). I wish they would have developed Cooper‚Äôs emotional storyline more but I guess it wouldn‚Äôt bring in the views
Well Billie never told Cooper about her sexual needs. I agree it‚Äôs okay to fantasize but if you don‚Äôt communicate it does not matter. On other hand when Copper read the journal he tried his best to attend her needs but still all Billie can do is fantasize about Brad. Think it this way put yourself in Cooper‚Äôs place and look at the story, you stay true to your wife, come home every night back to your family, try to be there whenever your family needs you and in the end you try hard but your wife still cheats on you(if you have seen the last episode you will know). I agree with Billie that sexual pleasure is important but not talking about that and fantasizing about your ex that‚Äôs commitment issue.
[deleted]
100%. Hard agree.
None of it would EVER have happened at a legit party. There are rules, both "written" and unwritten. Consent is everything, and Cooper would have been kicked out & banned SO FAST if that ever happened in real life.
You have the counter scene wrong. He started to stop and she said to continue and then told Sasha it was the best fuck she‚Äôd had in a long time. He was disgusted with himself the next morning and she was happy. The car scene is different and she did stay stop. That was wrong and he should have stopped. I would note, however, that she wanted Brad to stop fingering her in the elevator until she started liking it. She‚Äôs all over the place.

I think the BJ was awful. But, Cooper was both doing it as revenge (not okay) and I also think he was trying to be a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù like Brad. He was trying to be someone he was not for Billie because he wanted to be the husband he thinks she desires. She then put him in a box - she instructed him to be himself but being himself was not enough for her. I think the ending was her doing the same with Brad. Billie wants the men to meet her needs based on what she wants and doesn‚Äôt want them to change, even though she is effectively keeping them both from getting all they want. In her quest for 100% she is limiting them. That is incredibly selfish.
Y‚Äôall gotta Remember that nobody was in the right state of mind. Cooper was extremely demasculated by that point and Billie was obviously all over the place emotionally and didn‚Äôt know what she wanted. The real assholes were Trina and Devon as they knew exactly what they were doing and took advantage of them in their weakest moment.
thats bcz he read in her diary , how she tried to stop brad but then started liking it and didnt stop him .    
but she stopped him and didnt wanna do same with him, and keep fantasizing about her ex,    
so when the girl asked if she could give him blow job, he said yes in anger ....
Will I respect my partner who, though I haven‚Äôt cheated physically at all (though still wrong and right on the edge), violated my privacy, grabbed my face enough to bruise me, showed stalking tendencies, had his dick in someone else‚Äôs mouth, and displayed extreme violence? No. But that‚Äôs not even the point, all 3 of them are all damaged individuals and shouldn‚Äôt be with anyone. But in the make believe land where ‚Äúteams‚Äù are chosen in this show which will have a 2nd season sure to explore her hooking back up with Brad, I‚Äôm excited to see that. But I‚Äôm also Team Jacob (Twilight) and Team Damon (Vampire Diaries)
i mean honestly the whole thing screams Team Neither Of Them to me‚Ä¶.
"Then you have you current partner who loves you the most, take care of you, puts you above everything else, comes home every night to you, who is always their for your children, but not good in sex and they don‚Äôt know because you never mention it."

Cooper was NOT in love with Billie! This is what people aren't getting! No, he was not in love either. He was just better at hiding it. Look how he was pretty much ignoring her, more invested in the game while having sex with her, hadn't touched her in God knows how long...the list goes on! So this idea that she had to pick between good and evil is just not accurate! Cooper was meh at best. Brad had great moments and really low moments which in my book comes out ahead of meh especially after he had that aha moment with his dad. Women need to stop this idea of sacrificing passion for a somehow "safer" option. Newsflash, the safe option isn't exactly safe because he's not in love! The safest option is the guy who is IN LOVE with you. Not loves you, not likes you, hopelessly IN LOVE.
Old enough know toxic behavior when I see it what about you?
[deleted]
Lol you might be a good picker! Every dude I was with in my 20‚Äôs was very selfish and also had no idea what to do anytime they were down there lol. Same experience happened to most of my girlfriends. So you might just be a lucky picker!
I‚Äôm with you! Everyone I‚Äôve been with is quick to go down!
Yeah I always used to assume no guy would like that either, but in my late teens/early 20s I found that most guys I hooked up with wanted to do it. They weren‚Äôt all good at it, but they did try at least lol. I think maybe the first guy I was with wasn‚Äôt into it so I assumed all guys were like that, but luckily it turned out he was in the minority! I do agree that it‚Äôs unlikely that guy in the club would stop Sasha in the middle of a BJ to go down on her. He maybe would have done it before or after he was done.
Omg yes! My wild days were 18-23 and I would say 98% go down real fast, even one night stands
They both suck imo. Billie was pretty much having an emotional affair and her stuff with brad wasn‚Äôt ok. But then Cooper crossed a line at that party
that scene was sooo cringy to me. It made me so uncomfortable.
>people

so the emotional affaire Billie was heaving leading up to that point was what exactly? The physical act doesn't change the act of cheating, look it up.
Haven‚Äôt seen the series fully but from what I heard she never really cheated right ? In that case very cringe. Not to blame being a nice guy or anything but he definitely lost it at some point. Being sexually compatible seems really to be more important than we realize. And I kinda understand why she felt what she did for the dude from a psychological perspective. They had some crazy moments (metro f or example) that usually creates a bond between people that can be quite strong. This and the emotional rollercoasters. Usually a recipe for disaster. It sucks.
why did you have to say literally when he got his dick sucked, all you need to say. Cooper got his dick sucked in front of his crying wife. You don't mean figuratively so why do you need to say literally when it is by default? LIKE LIKE LIKE LITERALLY LIKE LIKE LIKE LIERRRRRRALLLLY EVERYTHING LIRRRRERLY
That‚Äôs funny cause she used to be married to Steve IRL...I heard she left him for the guy that plays Brad...not sure how true that is but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI think Fiona is hotter...
Sasha mentioning it is not the same as Billie and Cooper discussing the journal, why he read it, and how either of them feel. If there was a little bit of communication between them, this would have wrapped up easily and there would be no show. In fact, it's so fucking annoying that a PhD candidate has no clue how to express herself coherently. The characters are exaggerated caricatures and it makes the drama one big rediculous parody.
I felt the same way. That was a total violation of privacy. However the moment she decided to manipulate it to her benefit was either psychopathic or genius. I can understand if someone was too embarrassed to talk about sex how that might help. But at the same time it's kinda of cringy. Like cmon tell him that you went to be choked out or like it rough and just leave it at that
Isn‚Äôt that basically what they were suggesting? For billie to divorce and move on ? They weren‚Äôt saying she should stay in the marriage and cheat.
[deleted]
I cackled out loud at this and agree 100%.
Ah interesting point of view! What a storyline that would be..
That's exactly what I thought too. I think they want us to think she's cheating but they gave hints that it is going to be an open relationship.
She didn‚Äôt think of it because the show is badly written.
Yes! I can definitely see this perspective. Thanks for sharing.
Then she should also know cheating isn‚Äôt the answer. She‚Äôs terrible.
[deleted]
Yeah he was a good guy until they realised this ending is gonna make no sense so let‚Äôs make him do a couple bad things but still she chose better sex over her family that‚Äôs the most fucked part
Its so messed up
I think the thing that really gets me, is that Brad just fucking SUCKED. Like I genuinely feel like Billie liked aspects of her experience with him because he was a trash dude that capitalized on mutual lust to be seemingly good in bed, which I think is a really dangerous concept, especially for kink. Like I think it‚Äôs really amoral to display you fucking someone without their consent. I think people should have empathy with who they involve themselves with sexually, and I don‚Äôt think Brad gave a shit about Billie.

Sure there were absolutely other issues at play, and Cooper could have been a better man, too, but it‚Äôs infuriating to me that Billie made herself small to run to Brad, when he never seemed like a good dude.
I think you'd be surprised. Fantasy is different than acting out or anything. And it depends on how deep your love is for your partner. But I definitely think you can still think about someone else and love them too, but choose to be with your partner.
Is it saying that, or is it saying why should that phase HAVE to stop in your 20s? Do women need to give that life up in order to have kids and move on
It stung so bad in the first episode when he stared watching football while fingering her.
[removed]
Okay, you wanna elaborate on why?
Not nice!!!   Come on.
I mean let‚Äôs be honest, they dragged Billie and Cooper there for the sole purpose of fucking each other‚Äôs spouse and tried to play it off as helping.
I think they‚Äôre waiting for season 2. Season 1 was purely to get attention and people riled up.
I didn‚Äôt say it was a solution. But, they definitely did this to continue the story line and drag it. Otherwise, how they‚Äôre going to get a season 2.

I already said Billie is worse than Cooper. I didn‚Äôt say she was ‚Äúgood‚Äù, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù.

Maybe the ending was a dream. And, she wakes up etc.. Who knows.
I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúmost people‚Äù noticed it if I‚Äôm honest, seeing as majority people keep saying how much of a good guy Cooper. Maybe, they‚Äôll address it in season 2.
chill out they married, she‚Äôs trynna fucking cheat on him not like he‚Äôs fuckn r*ping her smh chill w that woke shit
Yes this!! From the first episode that one thing bothered me. Being married my thoughts in my journal are the only things that I can keep private and it‚Äôs rather unfair that he snooped around and read it, and then didn‚Äôt even want to talk about it for the longest time.
Right. But he was shown being mad about being best up and was using it to push for his idea in front of the boss right before. I wasn't clear on how or why he all of a sudden wasn't mad about it anymore
I really think they let that slide too quickly. There could have been a lot more development there. But then again, Billie let A LOT slide.
Ehhh I could. I‚Äôm the type when I get hurt I cut all contact with my exes. Would not give 2 shits if one of my best friends fucked them since they are dead to me üòÜ
I liked cooper! I liked him right up until episode 4 or 5 when I realized the show runner/writers had no intention of actually giving his character any development. Then I started hating him. All I wanted was for him to leave Billie, fuck Francesca, fuck a rando, do something to get his confidence and sexuality back but the writers are determined to keep him as some quintessential nice guy because they need a foil for Brad. Cooper is never allowed to be sexual unless he‚Äôs a prop for someone else or some other plot point (the Trina bj)

In my opinion he should have been absolutely done after Billie tried to gaslight him at the dinner with Brad. I was desperately hoping that he‚Äôd go home with Francesca and start regaining his confidence and start sticking up for himself, setting boundaries, whatever. And what does he do? He lays on her couch all night telling her about his feelings and failing marriage. It‚Äôs absurd.
At one point, Billie says the sex with Cooper had been good. We have zero back story on Cooper other than his comment that he was less sexually active when single than Billie. I think we may see more about his back story if there is a season 2. We may see why they married and that there was a spark. That may make him more likable.

The football TV scene is from the source/inspiration material. Her husband was having trouble ejaculating too early and would look at the TV to distract himself to last longer. Once she figured that out, they worked on it as a couple. I think Cooper came home exhausted, tried to be the good dad and has completely taken for granted Billie. Billie then wears the same long nightgown every night. Add in the Madonna/whore issue and a new born (probably when the M/W issue is at its peak), and you get a guy going through the motions. As someone who has been in his shoes (60 hour work weeks and little kids), I get it. Now, this doesn‚Äôt excuse the vibrator disinterest, but I can tell you that the inability to perform is crushing to a man‚Äôs ego, and sure as hell is not something you talk to your friends about. It‚Äôs also something that he may not fully understand and is even embarrassed to discuss with his wife. When he reads her stories (her first lie), which I think she initially wanted him to read or at least subconsciously wanted him to them, he is probably at his emotionally most fragile point. He spins out of control afterwards.

None of this is to blame Billie for the starting point. But, she probably has started to leave romance behind as well. I mentioned the gown above, but her whole wardrobe is mommy clothes, again, which I get, but there is nothing sexy going on. I noticed, when my wife returned to work after our children started school, that her wardrobe changed. It was more professional, but also more contemporary, complementary and sometimes sexy. I think we get a glimpse of this when she‚Äôs choosing a dress for dinner. The main point was that she was dressing up for Brad. But, I think the more subtle point, was that she had stopped dressing up for Cooper. In fact, except for the flashbacks and her time with people other than Cooper, the only sexy things she wore were to dinner with Brad, the night out with Brad, and the dress she wore to the play and the run to Brad.

Having been through counseling, my need to appreciate my wife more and my wife‚Äôs need to be more than just a mom were the first things we discussed. I now see why. And, after returning from an awful 10 year anniversary trip that had me calling a divorce lawyer, we patched things up, went from an awful sex life (that had been great) to an incredible sex life, and a deepened relationship as best friends, and 18 years later (28 years married) we‚Äôre happier than ever. Certainly some couples don‚Äôt succeed as we did, but I hope this show has the courage to address these issues (even if they ultimately cannot work it out), rather than the shallow will they/won‚Äôt they we saw this season.
It‚Äôs atrocious!!
Saving yourself for marriage is a laughable idea, where she went wrong is she settled for a cute nice guy because he acted right but was never in love with him
thank you for sharing your thoughts!   very interesting!  watching it too now!  . I only have one question. Why didn't Billie set a password on her laptop? I enjoy the series but it‚Äôs so stupid to put something like that in the script. Billie studied to become a psychologist and judging by her character, she is a rather stress-resistant woman - considering all the circumstances of her life. while she is keeping a diary - that is, she could still figure out the password. Especially considering the fact that her husband had already read the diary. Why not post the password after this? My opinion is that she is not only a victim but also an executioner. She herself is looking to be punished. she deliberately did not set a password on the laptop for the second time, like all people would have done, she wanted. for her husband to read the diary. what are your thoughts? is she so messed up Is she really a victim or a punisher here too?
I think that was more filming time logistics. They had to focus on the plot. I‚Äôm sure they filmed scenes with her and the kids but just decided to cut them in the editing room because they have time constraints for each episode and anything that‚Äôs not directly linked to the plot gets cut. It‚Äôs called Sex Life not mom life ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è in my opinion all the cute moments with her kids were sweet! It‚Äôs refreshing to see a mom her age with really young kids and a baby, usually women her age are cast having teenage kids but more women are having kids later in life and to me that seems more realistic/current anyway.
[deleted]
Talk about blast from the past üòÇ
I thought about that! But there‚Äôs nothing to really indicate that their present is 8 years from now and in the future she still has the same phone.. iPhones don‚Äôt last as long as Nokia‚Äôs lol, there‚Äôs no way someone has the same iPhone for 8 years.
I came up with the same rationale because of their college nights saying ‚Äúyaaaasss‚Äù and all that. I don‚Äôt think that was as popular 8 years ago
I think how you feel is completely valid, and by how it is depicted in pop culture, seems to be very normal among women in marriages. I guess the question is what can we do about it? 

One point that really stuck out to me in your reply is where you said, ‚Äúwhen I feel like I have to force it, it is no longer fun or fulfilling.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs one of the most difficult aspects I‚Äôve faced in adult relationships because I want men to do what I want in a sexual setting, but if I have to tell them or initiate it or suggest it or literally take his hand and show him, it‚Äôs no longer sexy or really scratching the itch for me anymore. But how are they supposed to know if we don‚Äôt tell them? It‚Äôs such a catch 22. 

The other part of your comment that spoke to me is that it didn‚Äôt used to be that way for you guys!! So not only are you feeling frustrated with how things are in the bedroom, but you KNOW it‚Äôs possible for you guys because you‚Äôve had it that way before! Idk about you but I find it really uncomfortable and emotionally exhausting to try and have communication with men about ‚Äúneeds‚Äù and they tend to get defensive sometimes. Many people have walls around sexuality and intimacy that makes things hard to talk about, myself included, plus I have a general aversion to being in awkward situations and don‚Äôt necessarily feel empowered enough to speak up for what I want in the bedroom because I‚Äôm a generally people pleaser. 

It sounds like you have really given it your all to try and spice things up and try different things and I think that‚Äôs something to be proud of. When I feel frustrated  (or hitting a wall in anything in my life) I try to take a step back and say to myself ‚Äúwell at least I‚Äôm trying my hardest, some people don‚Äôt even try, and so I‚Äôm proud of that‚Äù even if I‚Äôm still disheartened. I hope this is only a temporary slump for you and your husband and one day you‚Äôll look back and laugh and be like the frisky elderly people in assisted living facilities!! (You know some of those complexes have more STD cases than high schools!!) 

Thank you for sharing. I think I love Reddit so much because people can vent and be honest and if I had asked anyone I know this same question face-to-face, they‚Äôd feel inclined to say their sex life is great and has no issues. I appreciate your real-ness and rawness to share your experience with a 20-something trying to wrap her head around marriage!
Yay!! I love reading this and love this for you. That‚Äôs what I want! I don‚Äôt need every day of my life to knock my socks off, just not to be totally forgotten. Even now with my partner and my busy schedules there are weeks that go by sometimes without even trying or noticing that we haven‚Äôt had sex, we‚Äôre either so busy or just so dead tired. And it really doesn‚Äôt bother me because we always pick back up. I think having you both be so agreeable going into it to be open and be committed to growing as you grow seems like the ticket. You guys are goals!!
That‚Äôs very true. I‚Äôm sure in her mind she believed it was all over. Billie chose Cooper and they seemed to have worked it all out. So she probably assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
Oh I realized it while examining a screenshot I took of said scene üòÇ
Oops, my bad
so true , her being a psychology student , was the stupidest part of show
yeah it was sad. She was someone who totally put herself first. When she jumped up to leave her kids concert to go to Brad's there was a line that said something like, women have to leave their wild fun selves in the past...well yeah when you get married there are no more sexcapades with guys besides your husband unless you have an open marriage (same goes for men)
It was a statement of fact not judgement
What about sexual compatability?
Marriage is stupid
A lot of women marry because they want children and have reached a certain age where it is now or never. I have many girlfriends who chose having kids with a man they settled for rather than waiting to find true love because their time was limited. I have two friends in fact who never loved their husbands, but wanted a father figure for their kids. Those women are now either divorced, were in abusive situations then left, or are now miserable and telling me they would give anything to have an affair right now. I found this show realistic for women who settled.
I was living when he threw it back in Billies face that he could get something from Francesca taht Billie couldn‚Äôt give him but he chose to be loyal. I thought he would finally divorce her. I feel like I have divorce blue balls from this show. I usually root for the antagonist but even I wanted to marry Cooper
Wait I just watched that scene and you don‚Äôt see him at all... totally blocked by Trina the entire time. Did I miss another scene?
I was so mad when she caught him and he came up with that bullshit and then she forgave him!!!. Like she just caught him macking on some rando after a MF miscarriage!!
a sex party like that, people aren't going to stop their moments of sexual bliss to watch the newbies bang each other. That was a load of horse shit, like the entire show.
Nobody mentions that. But every since then I was thinkin he wanted brad to share
Yeah I figured I just don't understand why they made this series it has no plot ?
Well I took it as they both decided to have open marriage by the end since both are cheating on each other.
Damn that is super close, thank you!
But we don‚Äôt know if she cheated on her husband or not, the intention wasn‚Äôt there until the cliffhanger. And come on, that wouldn‚Äôt be a show. üòè
What was rude? üòÇ
Not everyone is going to kiss your ass. Sorry if you took a debate about a show as me being rude but thats a you problem üòÇ (and yes, NOW I am definitely being rude). 

Anyways üôÑ
Do you not remember when she was in the alley making out with him and then got a text... if not then you need to watch the show again and not let your #KAM mindset get in the way üò¨
I was actually really hoping Cooper‚Äôs arc would be more interesting too! I kept wanting him to break his nice guy streak and not in the way they show us with him being borderline sexually abusive to his wife. I wanted him to cheat on her or freeze her out or really call her a bitch or something. But they made him into this incorruptible good guy. 

Every episode Billie did something dumb, he‚Äôd get mad, but no then he‚Äôd inevitably end up apologizing and pledging his love to her again before the end of the episode. And then they do that cycle again in the next. I wanted him to fuck Francesca just ONCE. But I realized partway through the series that they can‚Äôt do that, but then they lose the tired, played out trope of the good guy/bad boy ‚Äúwho will she choose dynamic‚Äù, and that‚Äôs literally all the show is built on. 

There is no character complexity, growth, or progression. Cooper will always be a nice guy and make the nice guy move, he won‚Äôt leave his wife or ever put himself first. Brad will always be a manipulative and abusive asshole who does what he wants no matter the consequences for him or anyone else. Sasha will always be a tacit enabler. And Billie will always be the spoiled child who waffles between her competing desire for love/security and sexual satisfaction, the one that wins depends strictly on how she feels at the moment and who she‚Äôs with.

Sorry to go on a rant but I was just so thoroughly disappointed with this show and every time I thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse or more predictable, somehow it did.
I disagree, I thought it was implied they had discussed her sexual needs when she tells him in the early scenes ‚Äújust get the vibrator‚Äù because he‚Äôs watching tv while they‚Äôre having sex. Sorry but you don‚Äôt need a full blown lecture to know what a turn off that is, not to mention disrespectful to your partner.
Coming in a little hot for someone who has obviously missed the point
EXACTLY!! it actually made me really made for the poly/swinger community that they represented parties that way üò§ like literally the whole basis around that world is consent.
THIS! She wants the 85 from Cooper and the 15 from Brad but what about the two men then? Will she be okay with Cooper getting 15 from Francesca? And there will come a day that Brad wants more than 15 from Billie. She should think. Sometimes we have to let go of something we desire to keep something important. I totally don't even kno where it could go from where it left off but I just kno that I hope season 2 treats Cooper better. I felt so bad for him throughout the whole season because HE DESERVES BETTER!!
Agree.
Cooper is clearly the ‚Äúright‚Äù choice. He spirals out a bit but a lot of this could have been avoided if she had just spoken to him about her dissatisfaction. Granted he also should not have read her journal and taken her up on talking about it when she first offered. 

That said cooper‚Äôs only real flaw is that he didn‚Äôt leave Billie the moment she enlisted her friend to help gaslight him at the dinner with Brad.
the english makes me wheeze, clearly shows you aren‚Äôt old enough lol.
The biphobia is unnecessary
I‚Äôm not gay. I‚Äôm pansexual.
it's definitely not mostly luck because i def go for guys who are thoughtful good people in general. also i think for any guy it's an acquired thing so you kinda have to have relationships to get into it for a guy, if a guy is only having 1 night stands or short flings he probably isn't going downtown.. but yes i feel grateful üòÑ
Age might be a factor here.  I'm not sure how long ago your 20's were but I'm in my late 40's and agree, men in their 20s 2-3 decades ago weren't much about going downtown. It was hit or miss, really. 

These days, with all the internet access, sexual positivity, tv shows, articles, social media etc younger men (I daresay men of all ages, actually) are much more *woke in regard to pleasing women. I mean 30yrs ago if a man offered to eat my ass, I'd have been shocked beyond comprehension. These days, I'm more surprised if they DON'T ask! ü§£
Damn, I‚Äôve slept with some crap men then!
did he tho? I mean didn't Billie constantly telling him she loved him and it was nothing with brad (bold face lie....episodes over) not much worse than a mutual agreed upon sex party visit (with no rules)....
I actually think the emotional affair is worse in the long term. Without assigning blame of he‚Äôs worse or she‚Äôs worse because of their conduct, I think as far as killing a marriage, loving someone more than your spouse at a deeply emotional level is much worse than the momentary orgasmic pleasure than blowing a load in friend‚Äôs mouth. Sure, it traumatized Billie and violated her trust. But, he didn‚Äôt linger on the memory and didn‚Äôt lie about his feelings. She‚Äôs constantly lying to him about Brad. He repeatedly calls her on it and sometimes she‚Äôs sort of honest once called out, and then tries to manipulate Cooper to meet her end. The dinner is the best example. I‚Äôm the moments before and by the Fay after, they‚Äôd mostly worked out the BJ. But, as long as she‚Äôs emotionally attached to Brad more than she is Cooper, there is no fixing this. And, for that reason, I think an emotional affair is much worse than a physical one.
Didn't Cooper have an emotional affair with Francesca?
The advice was for Billie to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm saying she should be more committed to her marriage.

Divorce is a last resort. It mucks too many people‚Äôs lives-up‚Ä¶
Finally someone who feels the same way I do! I cringe when women talk about how hot he is and how they‚Äôre all Team Brad. If the tables were turned and the show was about a married man who cheated on his wife (with her ex who she had crazy sex with and can‚Äôt stop thinking about) because she didn‚Äôt please him sexually, there would be so much backlash. They certainly wouldn‚Äôt be praising the ex for having massive, natural boobs ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

For sure.  I hated how her PPD turned into an existential crisis for him also.
Cooper tried to be Brad when all Billie wanted was for Cooper to be better than him. Cooper was forcing the sex Billie had with Brad because he wanted to be him.

and 9/11 has nothing to do with sex/life but go off i guess
For one you‚Äôre painting Cooper as the worst person on the show. Brad literally FaceTimed his fuck session with Billie‚Äôs best friend Sasha to her, just to prove some kind of point. Never mind that in the process he completely violated Sasha‚Äôs privacy and didn‚Äôt get any kind of consent. And this was after his ‚Äú8 years of working on himself‚Äù. 

Then Sasha and Billie work together to literally gaslight Cooper at the group dinner, during which they both let Brad throw shots and wax poetic about how much he and Billie fucked on whatever island they were at 8 years ago.

You don‚Äôt have to like Cooper but he is by far the best character on the show. It‚Äôs not his fault the writers mad him a spineless wimp.
I wonder if it‚Äôll get renewed
Please don‚Äôt think I was taking issue with your comment. I‚Äôm mad at the storyline, not you. Billie, Cooper, Brad, Sasha‚Ä¶ all the characters in fact‚Ä¶ are flawed and the worst versions of themselves.
I certainly hope so, that made me uncomfortable, maybe that was supposed to happen though to show his darker side? Or selfish side? It‚Äôs just weird tho because they don‚Äôt like try to portray him as selfish, jealous maybe but you‚Äôre so right they keep playing up the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù thing
I hated the ending. I don‚Äôt like how they are portraying poly relationships or why/ how they opened their relationship
Because he gained respect for him after cooper called him out and defended his wife. He owned up to the fact that he played a part as well, it‚Äôs what good friends do
maturity
I‚Äôm honestly shocked there never was the whole ‚Äúmy husband betrayed my trust and privacy by reading my private journal‚Äù thing, because he did violate that repeatedly. Even going so far as to get off while reading it.
[deleted]
I agree, you can tell that she is a very loving mum despite all of her struggles. And yes to the young kids! I think that's why I'm so drawn to the show because I resonate with a lot of it. Pretty much all of those awkward mum moments I've had and glad to see it normalised üôÇ
I mean, she's the actress playing the role, I'm just pointing out that her body looks like that despite the fact that she's had 3 children in 5 or 6 years. Of course it's not all women, and TV has a loooong way to go to portray people more accurately, but we shouldn't take the effort she made away from Shahi. She did get back into shape, and the character she portrays is a stay-at-home mother of two so it's reasonable to think that she's had time to hit the gym.
True! There seemed to be a time lapse but I‚Äôm not sure how long it was
[deleted]
It's not the settling part that I found most unrealistic, it was all of the fantasies about Brad. I mean, if a guy breaks up with you telling you he doesn't love you after he cheated with hookers and made out with a bartender at a wedding you took him to, he just doesn't love you for Christ's sake. And no, men don't want or need to be "fixed" by a mother figure/psychologist girlfriend who's willing to take all of their abuse. I found all of this extremely stupid and potentially even dangerous.

> I have many girlfriends who chose having kids with a man they settled for rather than waiting to find true love because their time was limited.

I haven't seen this firsthand as none of my friends have kids yet, I find this terribly sad.
It was the scene when he and Cooper were in the showers at the gym.
Because Netflix is the dumpster-fire of the entertainment industry. [It‚Äôs like Cosmopolitan: they THINK they‚Äôre making all kinds of quality content for meaningful purposes but their viewers only view for comedy, to get a good laugh (because their content is that horrible).](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xrj7k/dear_women_of_reddit_what_is_the_appeal_of_cosmo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) This show is similar in that the writers and director THINK they‚Äôre sending a good message and they THINK the writing is good but really the entire show is a tutorial on what NOT to do in this situation and a reminder to NOT be like Billie.
You are welcome! It‚Äôs one of the few things I liked about the show üòÖ
They didn't kiss in the alley. It looked like they might but they never actually did. Billy came to her senses then stormed off.
i mean it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, but it is a bit embarrassing for you. 

of course i remember that once instance in the latter half of the show, where she abruptly left to go back to her husband. i don‚Äôt think that helps prove your point at all but go off! 

nice chatting with you!
[deleted]
To add on to your thought: I am sure Mike Vogel has the ability to perform on a deeper level and develop the character. I suppose their target audience appreciates the primitive contrast of bad boy/good guy.
Brad is the right choice. But marriage has to always be promoted in American society regardless of how unhealthy and dysfunctional.
I am honestly not sure he is.  He refused to talk about the journal and she asked him too a couple times.  He basically refused to talk about it at all I til things had spiraled so far out of control (and that is on both of them cause knows her actions err awful).  

But also he pretty much raped her in that scene where he was trying to prove he could get off.  She asked him to slow down she gave him the words and signals she was not enjoying this and he kept going.  That is a fucking dick ass move.   Just to prove you can get off.  

Cooper sucks just as much as anyone.
If you know so much why did you bother commenting?
[deleted]
Well, good on ya then! 
Most of the flashback sex scenes I‚Äôve seen on the show so far were one night stands, that‚Äôs what made me laugh. Like you said, most dudes aren‚Äôt going down on a one night stand. But ya never know!
I mean she clearly said no and he did it anyway. He even admitted it was cheating later on. She emotionally cheated a lot, he physically cheated once‚Ä¶ maybe one is worse but they‚Äôre both bad
You‚Äôre pretty wise divorced2020
The funny thing is your name is divorced 2020. Lol.
Lol omg you are SO right! If the tables were turned there would be a total uproar!
It‚Äôs not good to have an open relationship to save your relationship though and I think (and I‚Äôm hoping) Francesca and Coop will fall in love cause they‚Äôre just perfect for each other (and she‚Äôs insanely gorgeous) and Coop is just monogamous you can‚Äôt force yourself to be poly
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt deny that Brad did a lot of awful shit. I guess my point was that I think we are suppose to like Cooper the best and I just didn‚Äôt. He rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning, plus I felt like even if we removed Brad from the situation Billie and Cooper were doomed to crash and burn already. I saw so many red flags between them from the start and then when Brad got thrown in the mix it just amplified them. To be honest the only good/innocent people is the show were the kids in my opinion. I think Brad and Billie are meant for each other, they both can be toxic together. Cooper can go off and be with someone like Francesca who I think is a better fit for him.
It will. Kardashians are tweeting about it lol
Oh okay, that‚Äôs fine. 

I think the point of storyline is for you to get ‚Äúmad‚Äù, so they can get more seasons and fix the story line in future?

It‚Äôs done to stir up drama, get attention and I even saw Kardashians posting about the show on their Instagram story - to encourage people to watch it.

It‚Äôs for drama. Try not to take it seriously, I watched it as a joke/drama.
I feel like they showed his selfish side from the beginning. During the scene where he finishes early and then chooses to watch football over helping his wife get there. He ignored his wife for 18 months after she's given birth. 18 months without touching her or acknowledging her as a sexual being. She should've said something earlier but my contempt for Cooper knows no bounds. It is honestly upsetting how many people on Twitter think he's this really great guy.
Yes! with the conclusion being what it was, they could‚Äôve honestly just made it into a movie rather than a full series IMO
yeah i‚Äôm not even poly and i know that you should never open up a marriage to ‚Äúfix‚Äù things, or just to make the other person happy. that was a horrible ending, not to mention the demonizing of the swingers at that party. awful show lol why am i here üòÖ
Noted! Thanks for explaining.
I would want to leave and get a whole new friend group, a divorce and maybe a restraining order tbh.
Traditionally, men bought wives and had sex with whores.

>You need someone even better to top him

You seem to think there is an objective measure of men but the whole point is being in love with someone
[deleted]
Thank you I totally agree. All women‚Äôs bodies are real bodies. I get annoyed when thin or athletic women get demonized for (gasp!) being thin and then after having kids still being thin. I have a handful of close girlfriends with kids and most of them are either at their pre baby weight and some have gotten into more shape through working out. One gained some weight and doesn‚Äôt want to lose it and she looks fabulous as fuck. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs one type of norm and we shouldn‚Äôt demonize women for gaining weight, losing weight, losing muscle, or gaining muscle.
Sasha was willing to help Billie gaslight Cooper at the dinner with Brad. She‚Äôs confirmed trash.
I wouldn't have wanted to risk not being satisified or not being able to satisfy. Plus, I've met a lot of men who arent sexually compatible with me. I find saving yourself for marriage is an archaic religious rule that was placed upon women, but not for men, which makes it inherently sexist in nature. There would be no guarantee I would be satisfied or he and thus, straying would most definitely ensue.
It is terribly sad,  but they didnt want to risk not having kids or be unmarried like me at 42 because I still havent found someone I could see a long term future with who is emotionally mature and is non toxic/abusive(i also have fertility issues,  so I needed a man extremely supportive and loving through that process as well which I didnt find). I have had many women tell me I should have just had a kid with anybody, so I'd have the kid. I refused to have children with just anybody and most people have told me to my face they wouldn't have been comfortable with my standards or choices.I am happy with this choice though, have no regrets and they cant believe that I am because they wouldnt have been.
Also, I have a guy friend right now just broke up with a woman he dated for 3 years. She still texts him i miss you, cant we give it another chance and its been over a month; he is 42 and she is 51! Some people are emotionally unstable and need to work on themseleves and cant let things go. She thought their relationship was perfect and love can conquer anything, he thought it was terribly unhealthy and the relationship gave him anxiety. He walked on eggshells she was such an emotional loose cannon. My point is, there are people amongst us like this who cant let things go no matter how toxic it is. Some people equate toxic relationships with love because they were raised in that environment and that's what they associate as love. I know several people who brought children into abusive households thinking they could change the man(the man was an addict and or an abuser) or there was something wrong with them. The cycle of toxic relationships oftentimes is a generational pattern.
Oh thank you! I fast forwarded past it. So much was annoying me I skipped it!
It obviously bothers you because you‚Äôre still going, but ‚Äúokay, go off‚Äù üòÇ

Im sorry is cheating not cheating all of a sudden or?? It literally proves nothing BUT my point üò¨

You said she shouldn‚Äôt be criticized for fantasies... but hon they weren‚Äôt just that. So again I say, did you even watch the show?
I literally do not care even a little. üòê
Brad fucked her best friend and FaceTimed her during, without the friend‚Äôs consent. Even if you don‚Äôt like Cooper, Brad is not the right choice.

All good points.
Your comment makes 0 sense. Anyways im here to inform you that your opinion about the show is bullshit.
I think that‚Äôs where the term heterosexist comes into play
‚ÄúBiphobia is aversion toward bisexuality and bisexual people as individuals. It can take the form of denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual. Other forms of biphobia include bisexual erasure.‚Äù
But he also had an emotional affair with Francesca
Yeah‚Ä¶ I tried to forgive my cheating ex-wife (twice). Divorce was the last resort!
[deleted]
He is, but the bar is also incredibly low.
I agree with what you‚Äôre saying now but your previous comment had you come off as a Brad apologist which is probably why that person responded the way they did. No matter how we feel about Cooper, Brad is 100% abusive and toxic.
They are essentially back at square one with Billy feeling restless and wanting to explore her sexuality and Cooper feelings jealous and conflicted, but ultimately caving to Billy and her needs. I felt bad for Cooper because no one deserves to be cheated however his violent outbursts scare me. I do not like how the show is choosing not to address it and more just giving him a pass and say it‚Äôs just his insecurities. So I honestly do not have high hopes for season 2
Because the concept was intriguing. I aren‚Äôt a lot of shows that talk about PPD. It had a lot of potential
Yeah, there were no good people for her to surround herself with - and that‚Äôs also not discounting the fact that Billie herself needs a good amount of therapy too to work through what she‚Äôs going through. In some ways she self-sabotaged her marriage, and therapy would help her work through why she was lusting after and romanticizing a relationship with a man who was so emotionally and mentally harmful to her. If she was so unhappy and so unsatisfied, the therapy could help her get to the root of the discontent so she could properly vocalize those frustrations without acting out.
[deleted]
I definitely agree about your comment about her kid.  I thought the casting of her son was bad.  

Also, while props to her for looking amazing I do think all the hot bodies give the show a soft-core porn vibe.
[deleted]
Yeah, well I guess life is about tradeoffs. Some people value love more, for others it's having children. I think you made the better choice. I can't fathom having children "with anybody" as a woman.

I also felt the show was very much geared towards women of the latter kind especially in the last episode >!when she walks down the aisle and whispers to him, "I'm pregnant"!<. It was confirmation that for all the bs about mind-blowing sex and living your best life, having a baby is the ultimate happiness/goal for the character/whoever wrote the story.
lmao you definitely missed my point but that‚Äôs okay! reading comprehension isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs strong suit. be blessed!
You're not even aware when you are being rude, are you?  Try rereading your comments.
Lol, please. That's not even on the list of things that matter! Brad is the right choice because he is passionate about her and desires her, and vice versa. All the things she said she wants and didn't have in Cooper!
And I‚Äôm here to tell you nobody gives a fuck about your ‚Äúopinion‚Äù. I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre still replying if I don‚Äôt make sense to you. Now you don‚Äôt make sense.
[deleted]
Yeah. I agree. Divorce is definitely a last resort. My parents divorced when I was in 2nd grade and I had been a Daddy's girl and all of a sudden I only saw him every other weekend and then he remarried and had other children and completely forgot about me. I don't even talk to him now.
Yep, me too. Also, no way Francesca will settle for a part time relationship with Coop, so an open relationship won't fit unless of course its one sided and Coop becomes a cuck! 

I agree that Coop is a monogamous guy too, so more likely he will leave Billie for Francesca if Billie does get with Brad as the ending suggests. Remember he doesn't have the broad sexual history of Billie so is likely not to be into casual sex. 

And the BJ scene was sort of artificial and out of character for him, fuelled by frustration that he thought he was giving Billie what she craved at the sex party and she rejected him in public while everyone watched. Tbh, that sex party and how they were introduced was not very realistic. Normally, couples are chaperoned far more on first visit.
They‚Äôre equally bad bruv. He essentially raped his wife in one episode...
Yea, word vomiting got the better of me. Plus I watched the whole show in one day, which was a lot all at once.
You are absolutely right, it‚Äôs ridiculous how the ending was back at square one! 

 His aggressiveness is quite scary. This could entirely turn very dark. Sorry don‚Äôt know to turn notifications on üò©
yeah they really good have done a lot of good in terms of informing people about poly relationships and marriages. and i was looking forward to that. instead they crapped all over the concept and portrayed a bad version of it.
Well, I was born in a megacity and there is no going back to "old traditional setups" anyway.

By the way, villagers also cheated with whores whenever they went to the city. Girls from the country regularly ran away with soldiers in medieval Europe. Men often had multiple women alongside the wife.

There is no objective Brad, the women you mention simply settled for a man they didn't love because they probably share your values and think they "have" to get married by a certain age. The men they think are "BRAD" I probably wouldn't look twice at and vice versa.

Even the guy who played Brad, take away his fake dick, his staged persona, his professionally done hair and make up and see what's left.
[deleted]
Marriage will only benefit me if it does so financially. I have my own money, so I have found a lot of spongers/freeloaders out there (men) who want to live off of my money and lifestyle. It will only benefit me if they have as much if not more money than I do. I am not complaining about being unmarried, in fact, I would rather be unmarried than married to a man who I have to support or who has a low sex drive.
Having just watched the final episode, whoever wrote it definitely is showing that being a wife and a mother has priority over career and one cannot have it all, despite how much we try to. That is kind of depressing for a lot of women I believe.

For me, that is okay for I opted out of having children and to be honest, my career isn't all that important to me or defines me. I would like to publish some of my writing one day, but it will be okay if I do not. Same with getting married. I would like to be a wife one day, but I am not willing to settle and I derive happiness from my own company, so if that doesn't happen for me either, I know I will be okay. But with the last one, I still hold onto hope that I will find a husband though; someone who is thoughtful, kind, and emotionally mature.

For many women(and men), I have found once they reach my age, they seem to be filled with regrets and what might have beens and that is what this show plays upon. I try to live my life with few regrets and any bad experiences/relationships, I chock up to learning experiences and lessons that I can learn and grow from. I know many men and women who pine for the one who got away or whom they perceived was the ideal person for them.  I believe we can have multiple great loves and soulmates and thus, many people for whom we are compatible with. This show is showing that only Brad was the only one she could have been with ultimately, but lets be honest, there were many others other than Majid and Cooper that would have been compatible in some ways as well.
Definitely didn‚Äôt miss it, you just have nothing left and realize you sound like a hypocritical modern-day feministüòÇ

Don‚Äôt be blessed üòò
His recording sex with her friend, without her consent, and randomly sending that to her, also without consent, doesn‚Äôt matter? And that‚Äôs to say nothing of him cheating on her at her sisters wedding and then kicking her out. If you think none of those things matter cuz he‚Äôs ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù about her, you must lead either a very interesting life or a very uninteresting one. Either way you‚Äôve got stuff to work through.
shut. the. fuck. up.
**‚Äùdenial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation‚Ä¶bisexual erasure.‚Äù**
Sorry to hear that. I have three kids and I have 50% custody. They will always be my number one priority!

Never thought I‚Äôd get divorced. Thought I was protected from that by our Christian beliefs and view of marriage.

But it takes two to make a marriage work‚Ä¶
it was to show Billie other women still wanted him, it was to face her and his own shortcomings (literally) on the nose. Her crying was bull shit, she doesn't LOVE Cooper, she LOVES brad, cooper is just the father of his children.
You‚Äôre right, but he‚Äôs the only one that doesn‚Äôt actively, and continually, participate in the premeditated harm of the people around him. It‚Äôs small, but I think that puts him up by like a point. They‚Äôre all pretty trash tho
She never said stop
Same here, watched it all at once, pretty much. And I am also very much team Brad. I found the ending weird and messy and overly angling for a second season, by the way, especially because I think if I felt about a partner the way Cooper is described, I would leave instantly. Life is too short to stick around for the image of it all. And I would have loved to see a split custody show, where she'd get to be the perfect mum when she has the kids, but when it's Cooper's week/whatever, she could still be that other side of herself. You know, having it all.
(By the way how did they write such a codependent kid and not bring that up at all?)
My hopes for the second season is less sex scenes and more story.
[deleted]
And the hosts name was Karen üòÜ
I won't have children either, I never wanted to, even as a child.

I also won't get married (I think weddings are stupid lol) but I do believe in true love. I don't believe I could "have it all" as in children, a lucrative career and a great relationship with my man. I guess some women do it and good for them, but I have high standards so I won't even try. I picked my favourite among the three and everything else is an option.
nothing left? how does it serve me to continue a conversation with someone who isn‚Äôt interested in actually attempting to understand what i‚Äôm saying? like i said, be blessed! have a nice day üòò
And you must be a perfect person and spotless because I'm obviously talking about the new and reformed version of him. Clearly, that guy who did all those things was already rejected and can no longer exist. It obviously took that rejection to wake him up. What about her own husband getting a blow job right in front of her? Her own "perfect" husband ignoring her and being inattentive, disinterested in sex with her etc. Plus he's low key violent, punched that other guy and got into a physical fight and almost lost his job. If you think those things are okay just because he put a ring on it, bought a house in the burbs and got her pregnant, you've got staff to work out. But then again, you represent every woman
get. the. fuck. off. my. post. thanks.
[deleted]
She did. And he responded ‚ÄúI need to‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not sure how you are seeing that them separating would make her ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù. She mentioned a bunch of times the 85/15 where 85% of her life was great and the 15 that wasn‚Äôt was just sex. Separating will give her the 15 great but she‚Äôd lose the 85. That‚Äôs not a win IMO.
Yeah the show would‚Äôve ended well if he never went to see brad to convince him to stay and just took care of his kids from a far with his boss ü§îwho I thought looked way better than billie anyway
Me too! The story of their lives is important and I‚Äôm sure many married couples can (sadly) secretly relate to this
Again, if you go by "what we're wired for", it's not necessarily marriage and monogamy. It's pretty clear men are wired for sexual promiscuity. Every form of society is a compromise.

I agree with you on the futility of lavish weddings but I don't think getting married without taking sex into account is a good move. I would never settle for anything less than the full package including sexual chemistry and it's unlikely you will find that at the first shot and very young.
Didn‚Äôt you bless me and say you were done like 3 messages ago damn üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Damn you‚Äôre still going? üôÑ 
That‚Äôs crazy for someone who has so little to say
He FaceTimed her while fucking her friend *after* he supposedly changed. That‚Äôs not an old version of him that she rejected that‚Äôs literally the ‚Äúnew‚Äù him. He‚Äôs still a slimeball, he‚Äôs always going to be a slimeball, lol idk how you‚Äôre defending his abusive actions and vilifying Cooper. If you hated bottle of them I‚Äôd understand but agreeing to go to a swingers event together and getting a blowjob is not the same as **violating a woman‚Äôs privacy by FaceTiming your fuck session to her friend**. Cooper had a violent reaction himself and that‚Äôs not okay, but if you can forgive everything Brad did then I don‚Äôt see why you would hold that against Cooper. It‚Äôs just passion right?
Actually you‚Äôre still denying it, because what they actually said was they had one partner in the past that they loved having sex with more than anyone else. Not that they ‚Äúloved having sex with guys.‚Äù 

Every person has 1 past or current partner who has been their best sex. If you‚Äôre bisexual or pansexual whatever you want to call it, then that can obviously be a man OR a woman. In this case it was a man. I can‚Äôt believe this needs to be explained to you.
That‚Äôs actually not what I said. I said I settled down, which is a common phrase for getting married. And you incorrectly assigned my gender. I said I enjoyed sex with a man, which you assumed meant in gay. But in actuality, me saying I like sex with men would paint me as straight. As I am of the female variety.
Plus I'm not sure I believe she was only missing 15%, the way she was behaving.
Well Cooper isn't the only one/thing that can give her that 85%. She'd still have the kids which I imagine is something that makes her happy, plus a relationship with Brad who actually knows how to fuck her. Her relationship with Sasha would probably improve again because they wouldn't be keeping things from eachother plus she'd definitely gone back to work with him as well, especially since she'd have more time sharing parenting responsibilities like that. And the stability Brad might even be able to give her now, that should kind of come from within anyway, so maybe let's leave a few percent for a therapist.
