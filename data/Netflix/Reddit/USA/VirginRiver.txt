Can i just say that i really like the different nature places that they feature in each episode? Its amazing that they really captured the nature in VR. IMO i kinda feel like im also there. They also shared the different times of day. Like early morning, midday, afternoon. Its shown more often than the previous seasons. Im really glad that they did that.
I love this show but thought the whole Mel's sister's wedding episode was so cheesy.   No one in VR even really know these people but they all go to the wedding...just seemed odd.
I'm glad jack's Mel's baby's father and not Charmaine's but damn that would have been funny if he went from 3 potential babies to none
I don't understand the whole Preacher plot.
Someone took the kid in the previous season and then we just see him living his life as usual?
BROOOOOO IM OBSESSED WITH THIS SHOW!!!!!!
The garden scene with Hope & Lilly was an absolute masterpiece. We really miss Lilly in Virgin River
I really wasn’t sure what to expect from season 4. I was kinda let down after season 3. After watching an interview with Annette o’toole,  she pulled out right at the last minute and they had to completely re write her story line. It felt like a filler season to me, but as they were more concerned about the actors health and safety due to covid I totally understand why but it wasn’t the best season at all. 
So seeing season 4 now and having all the questions answered and finally seeing Mel and Jack as a couple and the way they played out each story line this season was quite the delight and I did really enjoy it. 

I love Brie and Brady, I think their chemistry is off the chart.  However did like Brie and Mike and their detective fun that they had going on. Will be interesting to see how that develops next season. 

So desperate to find out who the twins father is. 

Just got to wait another 12 months for the next season 🤣🤣🤣
I so called it that the twins aren't Jack's! All of Charmaine's bullshit last season and how convenient the timing of her finding out she was pregnant just after their break up. I think she must have had a rebound with someone in Virgin River after to get back at Jack for his feelings for Mel.

I love that they went that way though, the baby he really wants is truly his. I thought surely Mel would have been just a little sad, using the last two embryos her and Mark had and neither of them taking meant the last physical piece of him she had is gone. I imagine Mark's mom is gonna be livid. Hopefully, next season shows how that plays out with Mark's family.
I hated how this season ended. Denny seems like a waste of a character. But the actor/actress playing Nick and his sister? Wow! They really look like they could be siblings. Now, do we think Nick knows about the family business? Is it all a set up to frame Jack like he’s somehow in the drug ring?

Lastly, can Mel ever catch a break?
Who do you think the twins’ father is?
Anyone else a psychoanalyst when they watch this show?  
I love how Mel is so emotionally available and present in her relationship with Jack. It's a shame Jack can't meet her all the way in terms of emotional availability. He can't see past himself to see that his behaviors and lack of willingness to enroll in therapy are hurting him and the people around him.
Does anyone else feel like Charmaine’s been pregnant for 466439847429 years
Am I the only one who likes Cameron and thinks he was doing Mel a solid warning her based on his experience?
God this show is ridiculous. I’m invested, and I will continue to watch, but everything in my core is cringing. I barely remember secondary characters. Half of the time I’m sitting here like, “Who the fuck is Joe Ellen??!” There are way too many storylines and events happening and I can’t keep track of them all. Plane crash/emergency landing? It’s okay, everything is fine and the whole event is forgotten about within 5 minutes. Random old dude collapsing at the super market? Yeah, he died, and we will talk about him for roughly 3 minutes and move on again. Majority of these storylines lead absolutely nowhere and is infuriating. It’s quite literally the show where nothing and everything happens simultaneously. But yet, I keep watching.
Is hope still the mayor?
I definitely liked this season more than I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised that they actually started wrapping up some storylines (at least the paternity ones), so it might feel slightly less chaotic next season.

That being said, I audibly groaned when the helicopter pilot started rubbing his arm. Taking literally any opportunity to create a crisis?? She’d just dealt with the elderly man at the grocery store ffs.
Because i read the books I just can’t buy Brie and Brady. I hate them but it’s just because Mike and Brie’s love story was my favorite after Jack and Mel’s. The actors have great chemistry which helps but god I am so angry they have gone this route bc I still think mike and Brie’s love story is more beautiful than this cliche “bad boy with a heart of gold” vibe they’re forcing work Brady and Brie. Oh well. The vast majority of people who watch this show never read the books have no idea about Brie and mike and will just accept her and Brady at face value. Sad.

I’m just relieved it looks like mike isn’t a dirty cop. That actor has such a gorgeous smile and dimples I hope we see more of him even if not with Brie. 

Thank god Charmaine finally came clean about lying.

Glad Paige is back. Guess that actress didn’t walk away from the show bc they fired her IRL husband or whatever the speculation was.

FF every scene with Lizzie and hope and doc and his scheming grandson zzzzz

Mel and Jack are flawless perfection
I have the slightest idea why I’ve kept watching this show. Timelines don’t add up, people stress about the wrong situations, it’s beyond confusing. Yet here I am on S4E7 … I truly hoping this would be the last season but nope the timelines suggest otherwise
I just read an article that said the show runners originally wanted Mel’s baby to be Mark’s and the twins to be Jack’s. They thought this would help with Jack’s character development. The character who plays Mel was upset about this idea. At the last minute, they changed Mel’s baby to be Jack’s and the twins to belong to someone else. They also said the father of the twins is not a stranger. 

Also, the new doctor will be back for season 5. Lastly, the actress who plays Mel said she hopes she’s still not pregnant in season 10(!)
Binged this entire series in 6 days— SO HAPPY I didn’t have to live 3 YEARS thinking those babies were actually JACK’S!!!
Where were joey’s kids at her wedding? Strange they wouldn’t be there?
Can someone explain the timeline to me!?? 
How old is Lily's baby. How is Charmaine only 5 months pregnant!??!
How did only five months go by in four seasons? And they had how many festivals during that time?

Did that doctor guy only last a few weeks? Does everyone miraculously recover from gunshot wounds and car accidents in a few days? Why is Mel upset with her sister marrying a guy after a month when she's only known Jack for five freaking months?

What is time? Does it exist?
I think Brie looks like a combo of Allie from the notebook & Regina George. (Yes I know the same actress plays both) lol
Brady and Brie are the cutest couple of season 4, change my mind!
Anyone else notice how the word “hey” is so overused in this show’s dialogue? It’s become a running joke in our family lol
Clearly everyone’s going to age too fast IRL for the really slow plot. Everyone but Tara 🤣💗
Does anyone else feel like there are multiple deleted scenes? Some of the time jumps felt forced, as if there were scenes in between that explained more.
My favorite season so far!!

I loved it so much.

Of course, a lot of unnecessary drama and unrealistic stuff, but that's what romantic dramas are for :D

There were so many wholesome interactions between Hope and Doc, Brady and Brie, Mel and Brie, Mel and Jack, also the interactions between the sewing/ knitting circle ladies were at times super funny and at times heart-wrenching... It was nice to see a lot of ''side'' characters having an active role in the town's life. And Jack FINALLY goes to therapy.  This season I really felt like I would like to live in a place like that (or at least somehow similar).
Every episode I was like this poor town everyone’s always got something going on. So
Many losses and just a series of unfortunate events. Then I’m like “oh yeah it’s a tv show”
I'm still thinking Mike is a dirty cop and involved with Wes/Vince. Now that we know that Montgomery is connected with Nick and now invested in Jack's new airbnb, I'm thinking that may be some drama in S5 for sure. I doubt Nick knows anything ( I really hope not). 
I'm glad Char came clean and told Jack the truth.  I'm glad Mel & Jack are in a good place and hopefully he'll keep up with his therapy and doesn't become an alcoholic.  
 Preacher will now have a triangle & I'm guessing will probably go back to Paige.  
If Cameron stays,  I'm thinking he may end up with Char or the new karate instructor.
It’s funny to me that Mel isn’t supposed to be experiencing too much stress but then Mel goes through numerous stressful events.
I don’t think Mel has irritated me more than in the Renaissance fair episode when the kid brother of the guy that Jack served with was talking to Jack she immediately introduced herself “I’m mel Monroe” like give this a freaking minute will you Mel before  you insert yourself. And who gives a shit? He didn’t come to see you ; he came to see Jack. I was actually rooting for Jack to drink all the mead in the bar just to piss her off. Also every time he looks sort of upset are you OK are you OK does anybody get a chance to just have a little bit of depression before they’re verbally  assaulted with are you OK?
I really liked this season! Up there with season 1. It just seemed more realistic without stupid drama and flowed better.
The ivf storyline makes zero sense. Natural cycle frozen transfers take place five days after ovulation. But you can only get pregnant in the days leading up to and say of ovulation. So if they broke up, she went away, had the transfer, returned and had sex with jack, that act couldn’t result in conception. It’d have to be intercourse before they broke up. How long was she away?
This show is so bad and such a poorly written acted and written train wreck I can’t stop watching. I have never seen less chemistry between two leads in my life
Re: Mel’s baby being Jack’s…

*Apart from the lawsuit bullshit from Mark’s mom*, I was actually sad that the pregnancy wasn’t from Mel’s IVF. It would have been a beautiful thing for Mark to live on through his children.
[deleted]
I love Brady & Brie and I loved them since the beginning when she found out he was hurt & went straight to the hospital. I kind of wish he would propose but hopefully we get it next season.
yall when the hell did christopher get taken??? I admit I was bingeing and may have missed but wtf?
Just finished watching everything and f*# the bomb at the end about Char. And I really hope Preacher is ok. Love the characters in this show. 
I feel this season was a bit more tame, compared to the last but it was still good. Still not sure about Denny.
How much time passed irl between season 3 & 4? It seems like all the actors aged a lot and/or gained weight. Confused.
So, apparently in Virgin River, only the teenagers practice safe sex! Ha!
I love VR only because it is ridiculously light and honestly ethically shallow. LOL. The way all these characters give in to their desires is outstanding. 

Jack was more than happy to have a (potential) third  baby with another woman while his previous girlfriend was carrying a duplet lol. 

 Mel was more than comfortable thinking his lovelove had impregnated his previous "one-night-stand for 3 years girl (AKA Charmaine)" while carrying a paternity-questionable pregnancy that she decided to get just after having fought with Jack. LOL. Like if only her maternity desire counts and not the consequences of having this procedure done with the sperm of her dead husband and a new relationship on the way. 

No sense of duty or sacrifice in this TV show. Only the characters' desires and aspirations shall prevail. Definitely, a contemporary picture of the modern western society. LOL.

The funny thing is that  everybody gets hurt at the end.
Who is the twins' father?!?
How come the Julia character who was Doc's lawyer in Season 3 is now Preacher's new love interest n Season 4?

It doesn't seem real. It's just wierd.

I know she's Colin Laurence's wife in real life. This character's bring back is unbelievable. Which, for VirginRiver is truly shocking and quite takes me out of my quilt-weaving zone.

It doesn't seem real. It's just weird. Preacher's love interest in the first season, or the drugging end of Seasonn3? And why does he spend most of Season 4 pretending he's concerned with Christopher going missng yet seems to spend all his time making chips?
OK I need to vent. 

Mels voice is one big vocal fry. FRIED. Her voice is so irritating.

Her hair, could it be more unnatural looking? Can they not dye it better?  The middle part, ugh, it's too long for medical practitioner work. 

Why does she constantly mug?

Why is she so snippy with patients and so know-it-all?

Her worried-look-when-acting-concerned. Too much. Just relax Mel. Stop mugging, grinning and gurning.

And relax the voice.
Whole show is a joke and just got worse this season. Characters are flat and have no chemistry. I think the kids (Lizzy and Ricky) are the only ones that can act of a paper bag. Jack and Melinda have no chemistry and Doc and Hope,  I guess nail it because they hate each other (old married couple trope). They all harp on any little instance that is just so not relatable to real marriages (let the small stuff go).  Benny obviously isn’t Doc’s grand kid and if he is only wants the drug perks. The predictability and bad acting make me sad.
Can anyone recommend anything similar to this show to watch until season 5? I feel lost hahaha
Best season since season 1. Isn’t a very high bar, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I’m basically hate-watching the show at this point. My rankings go from best to worst:

S1

•	⁠


S4

S3

S2

S3 is only above S2 for ironic enjoyment, it’s so bad it’s good unlike S2 where I hated half the characters. S4 actually has some halfway-decent stuff in it and I didn’t totally hate any characters, but it’s still incredibly stupid and the writing is simply awful. Meanwhile S1 is just a legitimately good heartwarming story, I miss that.
Can someone explain how Vince’s gun ends up in Brady’s car and what motive Vince had to frame Brady?
This show is basically each female character digging through other peoples belongings and people asking other people to not tell anybody something. 🤦‍♂️
Me and bf just finished. What the hell.
I'm new to Virgin River! I'm completely inlove with the show, what a beautiful place as well. As a Brit, this is how I imagine myself if I came to live in the US. It has such a rewatch factor too! I'm on season 4, episode 12. I don't mind spoilers either lol. I'm so happy, Jack is Mel's baby dad! They have both been through so much! I kinda knew about Charmaine from the word go.... now she's receiving a much needed reality slap!
My wife recently started watching and is up to S4:E6; I've picked up an episode here and there. It seems if the characters just shared information, the whole show wouldst have taken maybe an hour to this point. 

"I need to tell you something, but not right now." She has cancer. Or she's pregnant. Or he has a grandson. 

And, while I've never covered up a suspicious death, it seems prudent to stop meeting and talking about it.
Talk about a cringe ending. Paige skips town, leaves her son with someone who is not a relative, then shows up at the bar (knocking at the door after hours), and says, " Hi Preacher!" like a school girl would say to the senior boy she really likes in the hallway. The whole story was just stupid.
In four seasons, the show has progressed what, five months? But in the span of a single show, Jack waits on someone at the bar at lunch who is staying in a rental AirStream. By late afternoon, he has a lead on a bunch of Airstreams for sale, by 4, he has purchased them, by 5 he has a business partner, and by 6, he has them all decorated and ready to go, just in time for another pukey romance scene with Mel.
it’s soooo beautiful and peaceful, really balances out the show lol
yeah it's so serene i miss being close to nature!
Also, Joey's own kids were not even at the wedding which is even weirder.
I agree.  I lmao at the dancing scene where Lydie and Connie were dancing together.
I’d be so pissed if anyone showed up at my door, didn’t even call, and announced they were getting married in my town two days later and wanted me to help them. I don’t care if they are my sister 😂 I need a little notice!
Mel never told *anyone* what time the wedding was or where it would be. But everyone agrees to go  anyway.
I am so with you!!! so cheesy and plain weird.
He may have low key been happy! Lol!  Just kidding.
fuck Charmaine, hate that character lol.
i wish you were one of the writers
Who is the father then???? (Of the twins)
Omg could you imagine 😂😂
Jack throwing off all his clothes and running and dancing naked in the streets screaming in joy XD.
Yeah. I think he shouldve been traumatized or something. Its like the kidnapping is normal daily event. Or Stockholm syndrome
I am on episode 7 and I was curious about that. Not a mention so far about what happened or how he got out of the woods. He is just over living his best life.
YES! "My only concern is finding Christopher" ( chopping onions again)
Correct.
He was “kidnapped” by his uncle so he probably didn’t see it as kidnapping. He was just hanging out with his uncle
I cried like a baby. I didn't realize how much I missed Lilly.  Hope's vulnerability was gut wrenching.  The whole scene was beautiful.    I hope they incorporate Lilly in more flashbacks in S5.
[deleted]
More like 18 months
And in another 12-18 months, Charmaine will be like, seven months' pregnant.
Why did Annette sit out the season? Afraid of getting Covid?
I knew it was weird that she wasn’t in the show
I can sleep peacefully tonight knowing Mel’s baby is Jack’s and Charmaine’s babies are not 😴
I agree. I was expecting mixed feelings whatever the results were - I didn’t really think there was really one “good” result, at least for Mel.

I know this was unpopular, but I was kind of hoping the baby was Mark’s. I thought it would be interesting to see Jack parent a child not biologically his, and also to see how Mel dealt with having a living piece of Mark.

For Mel and Jack’s sake I hoped the baby was Jack’s, but I thought it would make the story for interesting for it to be Mark’s. 

Either way, glad they didn’t drag it out to next season!
This was stressing me out to the point I had to google it to find out if Jack fathered Char is Mel's baby! Sometimes I annoy myself, I ruin shows for myself and then stop watching because I'm annoyed I ruined them but this show was so good I never stopped watching despite googling WAY too much!
Im so glad about the twins, and so happy the baby is Jacks's, I was a little scared that could havebeen Marc, wanted to know since the first episode 🤣
It will be interesting to see how much he knows. I kept wondering the whole season why he had so darn much money to throw around. I guess this explains it.
I know this is silly, but it irritated me that they never addressed Denny being at least 50% Asian and looking absolutely nothing like Doc

Seems an odd casting decision, and an odd character altogether
Huntington disease doesn't present in young people. In his 20s he wouldn't have symptoms.
I remember the comment about Jo Ellen and Nick fighting at Joey’s wedding - I wonder if they were fighting about Nick’s shady, murdering sis?
[deleted]
I had to roll my eyes when Jack said she was 5 months??!! This timeline drags on like molasses!
I just finished the season and need to know!! I really have no guesses.
I still believe it is Mike’s. Because he was hella surprised when Jack told him he broke up with Charmaine.
Watch it be like Brady 😂😅🤣🤣
I think it’s todd , that would explain how they got together so quick
I think it’s Todd. I think she met him, he got her pregnant, he flaked so she panicked and told Jack he was the father, then Todd came back and told he he wanted to be involved and that’s why she jumped so quickly into a relationship with him and why Todd was talking about adopting the twins. Then Charmaine felt pressured to keep up the lie with Jack and Todd was getting sick of it, so he’s starting to cut out on Charmaine.
IVF unknown donor
I definitely don’t feel like it’s Mike— not dramatic enough of a storyline. My best guess is that it’s Brady, because that would be spicy as hell and would cause so much drama, or it’s Todd and he flaked originally, but then came back and flaked again. 

But let’s expand on this Brady theory: 
If it’s Brady it would be so MESSY. Char lied to Jack about him being the dad of her twins, but now Jack knows he’s not the father of the twins. But Brady, his sister’s troubled love interest/his least favorite person was also screwing char and now is the father of the babies everyone thought were jack’s all along?? Does this cause more drama between Jack and Brady? Or between Jack and Brie? Will Brie leave Brady or will she stick around like Mel was going to? This plot line seems much spicier than the possibility of it being mike. I find mike to be boring tbh
Nobody really cares. It wouldn't be shocking for any of the men to have seeded Charmaine unless Preacher or Doc. I can't imagine they're gonna weave that into the storyline. Both those characters have enough drama. I wish the Doc story would just end since I really can't stand Hope anymore. She's just too nasty and unbelievble to me as a character even though I understand she's the tentpole for the anti-hero position of the show. 

Charmaine was not even seen in the books after Mel moved into town. So who know how this storyline will play out. I really LIKE the actor playing Charmaine she has the most interseting fun character on the show.
I think it’s Calvin or one of his guys!
Omg , i did not think of this . I just assumed they might be Todd’s . 🤔
I think it’s Brady’s or Preachers
Love Mel’s communication skills and emotional maturity
lol, the actress who plays Charmaine has "Second longest pregnant woman on television." in her instagram bio. I think entire cast jokes about that too. Also Alex said to the writers that they HAVE TO make a time jump or speed things up because she doesn't want to be pregnant for 5 seasons like Charmaine lol
I love the chemistry with Mel and Jack but yes Jack is red flag 🚩 city.
“Who the fuck is jo Ellen” lmfao for real
These are exactly my thoughts. I'm wondering half the time how any of this bs got approved of and actually filmed without anyone hitting the brakes 😂 anyways, see you next season anyway, lol
They mentioned her name 1000000x this season. Thought about making an “every time you hear jo Ellen take a shot” game lol
This past season I kept asking myself “did this show get more ridiculous or did I just not notice before?” When it’s good it’s cheesy, but when it’s bad it’s just dull and boring. And the emergency landing, omg, the way Mel and Jack just walked arm and arm out of the hospital. Are you even going to check on your pilot friend?!? Dude almost died mid-air and there was no mention of him. You can’t help but laugh.
This season reminds me of a modern day soap opera. So much random drama for nothing
Omg same! I keep saying “this shit is terrible!”, yet I still watch 🤪
Lmfaoooooooo I say these exact things. Someone commented about Nick and his sister and I was like who the FUCK is Nick?! 🤣 I guess glamping dude? But yeah when I watch it I always say the SAME thing about random names that they mention 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️😭 And yes, I also said why are there SO MANY fuckin characters with screen time?? This never happens ever, which should actually be a good thing, but now it’s just annoying lol!
Literally has not done a day of work in the past 4 seasons.
Oh yeah this! Who do you think stepped up when hope was in the hospital? I mean definitely muriel took over for the events. But the daily management? I dont know whos capable and qualified
Forgot that. Hmm
I need to rewatch from the beginning, because I remember thinking aging/covid hit her like a freight train. I was sad about it. She used to seem so lovey and just looked like a shell here. Maybe she’s just a really good actress, but I thought it bled from real life too.
i mean that is literally the show. it's one crisis after another. it's like how many crazy things can happen?
I fast forward through the Lizzie, Denny and Hope scenes.  Mel is emotionally available to everyone on the show. S
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it yet again I cannot stand Brie and Brady as a couple and I never read the books. Their relationship for only sexual for 2 seasons. Just so boring and bland!! If seems they are trying to add depth to their story but I still font buy it because they didn’t earn any depth over the course of season 2/3. Just sex and leather jackets.
I didn't read the books. And I'm not going to. 

I agree about Brie and Brady- not a good story line at all. I don't see a future for this relationship. I'd much prefer to see her with Mike - he seems to be more her intellectual equal.  She's damn smart, Brady is a doofus. 

Since you read the books - who's Charmaine's real baby Daddy? I'm dying to know.
Ooh do you recommend the books?
Is it the same actress? I thought she looked like an entirely different person 🤣
I shaved hours off seasons 3 & 4 FFing Hope, Lizzie, Lily scenes.
You have summed up my feelings exactly. Horrible show, confusing timelines/behaviors/motivations, yet can't stop watching.
I’m happy the baby isn’t Mark’s just because I wasn’t going to be interested in the MIL/custody battle. The IVF itself was so unrealistic. I love people just loving kids and being good parents(biological or not) but that seemed like a stretch
Hey I’m not the only one who binged it so fast! 😂
Same!! I finished it in 5 days! I 2 all nighters on a 4 day weekend and couldn't stop watching!
Same here - just finished 😅 so happy that I‘ll have to wait way less longer haha
It was weird Joey would have her wedding in Virgin River. That entire story line was just odd.
I assume back at home with her ex.
There is no timeline in virgin river

![gif](giphy|zwE4anrOtHYaI)
i think the entire show has only been about 5-6 months so she'd be around that age, since lilly gave birth at the beginning of the series
And Lily had other daughters besides Tara so where are they and why aren’t they helping out or talked about?
Also has some [Kristin Cavallari](https://images.app.goo.gl/niDRRe8c9T2DdZGP8) vibes
 It’s interesting how you can say that when to me they look nothing alike (no similar face shape or facial features, different eye and hair colours, different body type) The actress who plays Brie looks Mediterranean, Rachel McAdams looks Nordic
I think Brie is too good for Brady, and they have no chemistry, but I'm sure I'm in the minority.
Brie Sheridan Brady would have a nice ring to it!
I agree. They literally have so much chemistry I hope she doesn’t end up with Mike. But they say in the books she does her and Brady love each other and he’s being very supportive.
Neither of them fit into the town
They are cute, but he gets so much hate. Im not crazy about Bries character. She really gives nothing.
Boy did they notch up the sexual chemistry this season!
Oh no. Can’t unhear it now
Yes!
Also, "copy that"
LOL Christopher went from like a tiny 9 year old to a 13 year old in 5 months.
obviously scene get from production
The sewing circle ladies are ride or die.  I love the way they care for each other.
I don’t like how they all of a sudden give Jack money problems? It always seemed like he was one of the more stable or whatever. At least he was donating a lot of time and resources. I mean three babies isn’t gonna break you if you’re rich.
Cameron is way too smart to have anything to do with Char.
Plane crash? Check. CPR on elderly man at the grocery store? Check. Planning a last minute wedding? Check. Bf goes missing? Check. Bf has PTSD and a drinking problem? Check. Delivering a stillborn? Check. MIL threatens to sue? Check. 

Literally give this woman a break please!! 😂
😂😂
You read my mind regarding that Renaissance scene. Calm tf down Mel.
Yessss....such self importance
I want to know if I the only one who thought Jack wasn’t drinking too much? Like early signs maybe were there but I didn’t think it was a big deal.  I also just don’t like when shows take characters, especially good guys, and I have to give them some hidden trauma to make them regress just to have something to do with them
Wasn’t it like a month? I thought….
She’s only in LA like 2 days unless they really messed up. You can tell from clothing continuity and verbal cues.
THANK YOU!! I watched all these scenes and I’m like…..they don’t seem even want to tolerate each other half the time.
That’s true but then Mark’s awful family would have to be involved which is a big no for me so I’m relieved!
Just had a thought- they only had 2 embryos and she used them both. Wouldn’t it be wild if mark’s mom sued Mel for “wasting” them? 🤦🏻‍♀️
I am so team Muriel now.
Season 3 Episode 10.
The Covie plandemic is the culprit.
Preacher.
I think she did IVF
Julia isn’t Doc’s lawyer, she is a medical recruiter and teaches martial arts on the side.  She helped Doc find Cameron.
I completely agree, you nailed it. 

The baby talk voice woth Jack in S4 is nothing short of disgusting
She’s a lousy actress, plain and simple.
What does mug mean?
/r/Hartofdixie

It’s more light hearted / comedic than VR, but it’s about a small town where a lovely older doctor played by Tim Matheson deals with a new hot shot big city doctor in his family practice.
i'd definitely do sweet magnolias
Anne with an E!
Can someone explain how Vince’s gun ends up in Brady’s car and what motive Vince had to frame Brady?

Edit-  I read:

The weapon was simply planted [by Vince] in his [Brady’s] car as a sneaky attempt on Vince’s part to clear his name.

So that explains part of my question, it was just bad luck on Brady’s part. But Brady had left the bar by the time Vince arrive..
And $$$ to live there in real life.
True!
This.  I wondered about this too.
Lol some people wait a month to even mention to their kids that they're seeing someone else, that's not their father. Here comes Joey, engaged AND married, 2 months after she got a divorce
Kid actors are expensive.
To be fair, Joey didn’t really ask for any help, she just asked Mel to be her maid of honor and said they were getting married at city hall. The whole ceremony and reception were Mel’s idea. But totally agree on the whole wedding in Virgin River without her kids is super weird…
She's the worst, completely insufferable. So pathetic and desperate.
That’s what got her into this predicament in the first place
She is the WORST.
Mmmm mike lmao
Preacher was traumatized, he started seeing a therapist and that's what helped him keep it together
Vince dropped him off at the house in exchange for Paige, but yeah, he should be way more traumatized.
Apparently it starts the next day after Charmaine’s huge bomb shell 👀🙈😭😬
I hope not 🤣
Sadly we are stuck in the elephant gestation period 🤣
From what she said it was about her elderly mother living with them and she wouldn’t have been able to of flown back and forth or something. I can’t remember the interview that she said it in now. I guess she just thought it would be better to not go.
There was no way that all three were going to be his. Since last season, I had a feeling Charmaine's weren't his but I thought this season they could go either way; Charmaine's would be his but Mel's wouldn't and they would have to deal with his one deeply wanted child not being biologically his or that they would take it the direction they did. I think I like this way best!
i totally wish the baby was mark's
I agree with you completely. I just finished last night and came here to see what others thought of the season.
Doc dated an Asian woman named Rose in college. She never told him she was pregnant with his kid. That kid was half whatever Doc is, and half Asian. If he married an Asian woman it would explain why Denny looks mostly Asian.

And as far as family resemblance, grandchildren often don't look like their grandparents. Especially when they're actors who aren't actually related 😂
The same mike people thought was a dirty cop? lol
I’ve been thinking the same thing since that exact moment too!
Mike amd char hooked up?
Mike would be an interesting storyline
Wow do you think so?!
Agreed. And he continuously makes comments about a past relationship but never goes into details.
Yes, I remember this. I was wondering if we'd see more interaction between the two of them this season to lend credit to this theory but they have avoided it. But I still think it's possible that it's him.
Wait who is Mike?!? 

Edit: omg lol I guess I didn’t know his name. I would love if it were him.
How long has it been since Mel got to Virgin River? Probably only a month at most before Charmaine got pregnant
When they come back she’ll probably only be six months lol! Not counting the fact that she was big as a house and already having her baby shower. That did not make sense!
And who has a baby shower at only 5 months pregnant?
That's one of my theories actually 😂

I think I need a re-watch to remember the timeline of when Jack and Charmaine were FWB, and when Jack started to gravitate toward Mel. During that timeframe I think Charmaine was pathologically angry at Jack and thought she could really hurt him if she slept with any (or all, if possible 😂) of his friends. And Brady took her up on it because he was upset with Jack too - likely while blotto so he possibly doesn't remember the event.

I know her motivation has been to hurt anyone else, including herself, without worry to try to lure Jack back to her, but I think she may have been in a very irrational phase right after Jack gave her the speech about not wanting to be in any relationships for the umpteenth time, only to dive straight into a serious relationship with Mel.

I like Brady's character a lot better now and think he definitely wouldn't do that now, but early seasons he was not such a stand up guy, he was hurt and angry because Jack rejected his friendship and if he was really drunk he would not have been thinking rationally. 

It would fit with the drama of the show, because it would also serve to throw yet another monkey wrench into his relationship with Brie.
There's a scene in season 1 where Brady gets off work at the bar and says, "I'm going to Clear River" so maybe that was a hint? idk
Idk why would he go along with Jack being the father then?
Yes, this makes the most sense to me as well
I feel like it could definitely be Todd. 

What if it’s Doc? Lol.
She can’t afford IVF based on other things she has said about her financial status
Brady is my best guess because Mike and Brei end up together in the books. And this version of Brady doesn't exist in Robyn Carr's version of Virgin River. Plus Charmaine also never ends up pregnant in the book version. She's a very minor character who Jack is honest with regarding his new feelings for Mel b/c he and Charmaine have a super casual relationship.

Charmaine comes to Virgin River literally once in all 20 books, sees Mel and how happy Jack is, then says she understands and leaves while wishing him well.

So between Brady and Charmaine's roles changing so dramatically, it's my guess that those two are part of each other's story. And that may also be what drives Mike and Brei together.
Although I’m almost a whole year late (“binged” the four seasons while injured over the last month), but I think the big dramatic push WAS the reveal that Jack isn’t the father of the twins. I’m also glad the writers pre-cushioned that with the discovery that he IS Mel’s baby’s genetic match, because what a frigging dramatic melting pot to rip two potentially beautiful futures away from him in one episode. 

Outside of that, I hope they don’t push the whole “who’s baby is this”/Daddy Drama storyline. As a writer, I would use this as an opportunity to cut back on character storylines and focus more on new branches within VR itself. To me, it seems like a way to wrap up Charmaine. Maybe we get a couple phone call scenes with her and Jack, show some confusion, upset, grief, and later (character growth) forgiveness of Charmaine by Jack, and maybe some support for her after her twins are born (in, like, Season 20…); and just let Charmaine’s character go, all in all. 

Agreed entirely.
Longest Pregnancy on TV:
Bonnie (Family Guy)
Charmaine (Virgin River)

? 😂
😂😂 I always think time happens quicker than it does and then I’m like “wait..no.. cause Charmaine’s still preggers” LOL
Thank god Alex gave that helpful advice too… it feels like the directors, producers and screen writers haven’t got their head screwed on right about timelines… and how Netflix is notorious for not allowing shows enough seasons… so how are they gonna survive for 10 + seasons?!
While other shows have time jumps like “3 months later” in VR we get “2 days later”
What’s hilarious is that I feel like this town is portrayed as a safe, quiet, American town with lovely people but in reality, with all the crazy shit that has gone down in what, five months? It’s actually the most dangerous town in the US 😂
I say that too! Or “the soap opera of Netflix” lmaooo. Nothing but random drama & I still keep watching this meaninglessness 🤣 but shiii I’ll watch anything when I’m tryna kill time 🤷🏽‍♀️
True!! They use any excuse for added drama. But then Jack disappears for a whole afternoon and the explanation is he fell asleep in his car. I feel like this would have been a great moment to add some drama and not two random people getting sick with Mel watching.
Thank you!!!
Charmaine was never pregnant in the books. She’s a suuuper minor character.

And I agree about Mike being more of an intellectual equal. Brady is going nowhere in life and just brings Brie down IMO.
Yes I do if you can be more mature than me lol and not get so frustrated about the parts of the book that they have not followed, which is basically the majority of storylines minus Mel and Jack (and even theirs is quite different than the books, much more soapy)
Agreed. And as someone going through IVF her “pop in” embryo transfer was so ridiculous and upsetting. I’m glad that storyline is over.
I was sure the baby was going to be Mark's because I didn't see the writers picking the less-dramatic option. That said, I'm really glad it didn't go that way.
Right! All I could think about was:

![gif](giphy|sw7KSBKL3yme4)
Yes, and the number of people that showed up who don't know her. Just stupid.
Cackling at the use of this gif!! Also yes I just try to suspend all disbelief when it comes to timelines with this show because it makes NO sense…at the end of the day, I still love it, so it clearly can’t bother me that much lol
These people have more happen to them in 5 months than I do in 10 years.
Makes no sense
You’re not alone. I’m so uninvested in them as a couple.
I'm with you on this..I like Brie, I just don't like Brady, something about him rubs me the wrong way.
I guess I'm in the minority.  I think the chemistry between Brie and Brady practically  jumps off the screen.
I do too, and I don't see the chemistry. The electric guitar power riffs whenever they get busy are actually funny!
Exactly. Impossible for her to have conceived with jack.
No way, it was a weekend or a week tops, in Virgin River time, a month would be the whole season.
I could totally see her trying to pull some BS like that but it wouldn’t hold up. I’m pretty sure it’s standard practice to implant multiple at a time for the best chances!
thank you!
Are people really still calling it a plandemic? 🙄
It’s kinda a “show off for the camera” thing since no one answered you. 
Like Jim from the Office
Basically the entire plot to VR season 1 😂 I kind of laugh thinking about Tim Mathewson reading the script to VR and being like, “I’ve got this character locked down, since, you know, I’ve already played him.”
Sweet Magnolias shows up on the more like this list.
did the show end resolved or was it cancelled / unresolved at the end?
Most expensive place to live in North America. It's amazing, and simultaneously horrible.
Really? I thought they filmed there because it’s cheap. It’s outside of Whistler right?
My mum noticed that too! How peculiar!
And let’s not forget how pissed Joey was at Bill for wanting to introduce his girlfriend to the kids
I said this a dozen times watching season 4. 

Mel is 8 or 10 weeks... and Charmaine is still only 5 months? Only 3 months difference? Come on!
Definitely something finally deeply satisfying!!
I knew from the start of season 2 they weren't Jacks.
I'm late to the party, but how do we know Rose was Asian? In one episode Doc is looking at a picture of his late son on the internet, and the man in the photo is Caucasian (and looks like Doc). I just assumed Doc's son's wife was Asian, hence Doc's grandson being half Asian?
Coming from someone who’s only seen S4, Mike is super suspicious to me(wife roped me into the show lol)
I feel like I need to start from S1 all over again. I was kinda sad I blew thru S4 in a couple of days.
This show is the worst!! And the best clearly cause I keep coming back for more! But it is ridiculous that she is stilll pregnant and only 5 months after all this time. 🙄
That’s a very good point 😂 im mad we will have to wait for so long to know !
My insurance covers IVF.
Can just buy donor sperm and insert, no need for ivf
True.
Brady is actually in the Virgin River books. He is a pot grower in the first book. It's not until the 7th book that he gets a legit job and becomes a part of the town.
Rachel on friends by the timeline of the show, was pregnant for about 15 months. Though it only spanned like 2 seasons.
Yes!! I always found those so awkward ‘3 days later’ like do we really need to know we’ve jumped by 3 days, we’re still in the same working week 😂
well, he passed out drunk in his car
Hahah thank you!
Ugh, yes! I’m also going through IVF / frozen embryo transfers and it was such an unrealistic portrayal of what is actually involved. It didn’t help educate those who don’t already understand, and it probably only frustrated those who are going through IVF. I would never say I’m glad her transfer failed, but I agree that I’m glad that storyline is over. Ps: good luck with everything :)
I laughed so much at this as I was thinking the same
He’s a sociopath with a heart of gold
I feel the opposite. I like Brady, he is authentic. Brie hides alot, like Jack.
You don't see him get physically taken but we know that's what happened based on the ending and then S4 E1.
You got it!
He directed both shows!
Love sweet magnolias
It had an ending
production costs are low. but the cost of housing is high. Canada offers tax incentives when it comes to filming and production. That's why a lot of series film in Canada.
He’s not suspicious in the books so I doubt they’re going that route on the show but we’ll see!

ETA “suspicious” because too many people thought I was saying mike wasn’t in the books
Same! I think he’s behind a lot of things
Same I haven’t watched seasons 1 and 2 since they were released so I’m forgetting a lot of little things that happened
That’s what I’m doing! Rewatch from the beginning!
Do most salons provide insurance?
Wow! That’s a blessing
Most don’t.
Oh, I didn't even connect the show Brady with Virgin River books Shady Brady. I suppose I was thrown off by the fact that in the show/books his entire back story and character are so different  - them sharing the same name never even clued me into this guy being Robyn Carr's Shady Brady, haha!
Which I find much less dramatic than having a heart attack on a plane
You too ♥️
He’s literally doing everything he can to support her but I do think he might kill Don. Preacher did it lol
I have to do a rewatch all the way through. Someone said it nicely on one of these threads that though it’s full of drama it’s still very peaceful drama lol
It's filmed in Canada? Where?
He's definitely IN the boks big time Just ends up as Brie's husband. I like that Brie/Mike story. 

THey're playing around with characters, so who knows? Either way I really really HOPE they edit Brady out altogether I hate thie dum bad boy character and the dum drug lord storyline. I haven't seen one good comment on the whole illegal dope growers gang and what it brings. In the books there are REAL bad boy situations with a kidnapping and real life vigilante stuff. I wish they'd do that here. Brady is so meh. The one time the actor was able to do anything decent emotionally was when he's coming clean to Jack and admitting he wants to go straight way back in season 1. That was it. All they've given him to do is be a biker touch guy who looks about as tough as boiled chicken.
He’s not in the books??? I could’ve swore somebody said he was and he ends up with Brie in the books
oh for sure
I like that.
On the west coast. There's some filming in Vancouver, Burnaby, Squamish, Coquitlam and and a lot in rural BC for the waterfall and river footage.
No clue
I meant he wasn’t suspicious in the books - edited my post. I loved mike and Brie so much and hAAAAAATE her with Brady
The Brady character had a lot of potential, but they dragged his redemption arc out way too long IMO.
No he IS in the books but he’s not a bad guy in the books. He and Brie have a beautiful love story because he’s a tortured cop going through some thangs while she’s a tortured attorney going through thangs. Much more depth than the BS with Brady and very unlikely to result in him being a criminal mastermind on the show.

That dog will not hunt
Ah, that makes sense. Gotta go to BC to see it now 😄 no mountains here in Manitoba
I'm in Manitoba too, in Winnipeg. Definitely no mountains here. Garbage Hill does not count 😂
Maybe...depends how scenic the garbage hill is 😄
