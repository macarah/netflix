I thought it was interesting Love chose to open a bakery - in season 2, her friends say Love cooks when she's happy, but bakes when she's stressed
Really was not expecting natalie to be killed that fast but here we are 🙃
"Joe? I think we need couples therapy." absolutely killed me.
Guess Ellie isn’t gonna be receiving money anymore, just another kid Joe left behind
I shouldn’t have binged; that was such an emotional roller coaster and I feel like I have whiplash. I just finished and that last episode is making me feel like I should write a 5 page essay on toxic relationships and do something nice for my husband for not being one giant red flag.
was anybody else wondering about loves best friends? Like they were so important to her last season, and not even a mention/reference now
i love how joe thinks putting a baseball hat on makes him invisible or something
Love has the best wardrobe I’ve seen in years. Stylist did a fantastic job. Or maybe it’s just Victoria Pedretti.
How did I go from despising Cary and Sherry to loving them and caring more about whether or not they got out at the end? Lol
>! The first few episodes made me forget all about the muders and I was rooting for them to raise henry normally like it wasn't some show about a murderer🤡💀!<
The part where they're yelling at each other with a dead body and a sleeping baby (Joe finds out Natalie is dead) is too fucking funny
In the end Sherry and Cary were the truly optimized couple
[deleted]
Loves teenage crush actor is older then she is I found this amusing for some reason
Poor Henry.

"Oh, so your parents really loved Ford, huh? Mustangs?"

"Oh, you said your name was Henry FORTY..."
Can’t believe they killed Natalie off that early in the show
The first three episodes of the season were the bright spot. Having Joe and Love together in their chaos was so enjoyable. But then we went to the monotonous route of Joe with some new girl that after the past two seasons felt really stale. Love & Theo and Joe & Librarian did not have any real chemistry. 

The final episodes were saved by Sherry and Cary. 

I like the show but I don't think season 4 is necessary if they're going to do the same thing again but in a different country.
Vanessa from Daredevil is their marriage therapist that’s just classic
I also still think love was weird for leading on this poor 19-year-old boy
maybe i'm alone in this but i loved season two the most. there were so many likeable characters, it was comedic, yet dark.
Am I the only one that loved batshit crazy Love? So entertaining!
Oh shit, I’m on ep 10 and edge of my seat right now.
Why did Joe just suddenly stopped thinking of what's good for Henry when he got fixed on Marianne?
Cary is the real hero of the season.
[deleted]
Just started watching season 3 and I don't really mind spoilers. Why does Joe keep saying that they're fucked when he found out their child is a boy?
Joe and Love hiding their own cage keys separately, plus Joe snarking at Love silently for losing her cool because she can't pay off the police to cover for her (and deliberately mentioning try killing a famous comedian without a fixer) made me chortle so loud.
Glad the baby went to Dante, I think he mentioned trying to adopt for 3 years? 

I know they'll love and protect  Henry with all that they've got 😭
every girl he’s obsessed with: *breathes*

Joe: are you flirting with me?
I have to let it out..enough with the fucking cage already!!
All I have to say is: WHY DIDNT THEY USE FREAKING GLOVES?!?! THEIR FINGERPRINTS WERE EVERYWHERE!!!
did anyone else feel like they made Loves last monologue felt a little too Gone-girl-esk? like it felt like a bit of lazy writing considering how similar it is. like you could tel me Love wrote the cool girl monologue and i would believe you
 on episode 5. 

Yo this camping trip is wild lmaoo
Am I the only one that felt super heartbroken that Love killed James? 💔
The bathtub scene 😭 I miss Forty so much
Binged the whole season today and the ending was disappointing. >!They should have found some way to continue their chemistry, either as a couple or not. Love made the show dramatically more entertaining than Beck or this new chick.!< It's difficult for me to care about a season 4 now.
20 minutes to go!!!! Can’t wait. Have an 8 hour flight today so I’m going to download it and binge it on the flight!!
After binging it all in one night, I can confidently say I loved and hated this season. The incessant need to make Joe stalk one person after the next makes his actions feel so poorly thought out and stupid, and I seriously have no idea where they will take the show in the next season. His likability is at an all time low and is honestly irredeemable after this season, so much so that I don’t see how keeping him as a protagonist in season 4 will work. That being said, the amount of action in this season was insane and I honestly really enjoyed Love and Joe working on things together and felt like it could have been a great vibe moving forward. Too bad Love is dead and the amazing acting of Victoria Pendretti is going to be gone from the show forever. Also, why was every character so stupid this entire season? Matthew had cameras on their house completely and didn’t see them drag the bodies into their house? He didn’t check the camera across from the bakery once in his obsession with finding his wife’s killer, but of course, his son immediately thinks of that.

I think as a season by itself, this was a great season. Characters were good, plot lines were interesting, and interactions between the Quinn-Goldberg family were top notch. But knowing we have to sit through another cringe inducing season of Joe being an insane stalker with no one to be his foil is worrisome. I hope Joe faces some kind of justice next season, because if they try and make him relatable and likable again I seriously don’t think I can handle it.
I dont know why people thought joe/love would last, he is a psychopath. Joe doesn't really love these women at all and it never seem like he loved his wife. If she wasn't pregnant he would have killed her. Joe cannot control his obsession and he will never stopped killing.
love was so much more annoying in this season. like i know they’re bad people but sometimes her hypocrisy was too much for me. it was a big 180 because when S2 came out, i was head over heels for love
Why was there so much sex this season lol
This season was pretty meh.  It started off really strong, the middle was incredibly boring, and I liked the end until we find out  >!Joe goes to Paris.!< I just don't see what they can do next season to keep things interesting or fresh.  It already feels like they're rehashing character types each season (there's always a douchebag "bro", there's always a bitchy female best friend) and Joe's internal struggle reminds me of a less-developed Dexter.  I'm sure I'll watch S4 but I don't have high hopes.

I think S1 was the best because it was truly unpredictable and Joe seemed like a unique character.  Now it all feels a bit...old and stale. 

The writing has never been great, but I think I've stayed constantly for Penn, if I'm being honest, lol
I thought it was kinda weird that Sherry is this momfluencer and her kids are her pride and joy, but you literally never see her with her kids except maybe once for a second.
Just finished binging the entire thing. I felt like the season had a lot of promise at the start but crash and burned at the end.

I think Love Quinn was the most interesting girl Joe has been obsessed with and sadly nobody will be able to follow up with her. Any new girl Joe obsesses over (Natalie, Marianne, etc.) just can’t compare and feels like a cheap imitation. I felt like killing her off was such a waste. Most of the tension and drama that occurred this season was due to her stupid impulsive decisions too (killing Natalie, hitting that guy with her roller, shouting and revealing that she was involved with Natalie’s death, etc.). I think her dynamic with Joe was interesting and could have been played out more, but everything got pushed aside for what I saw as the “B plot”: Joe’s obsession with Marianne and Matthew Engler’s surveillance (none of that was interesting btw).

I didn’t like how the show seemed to… *humanize* Joe and Love and try to justify their behavior. Season 1 was amazing because it was unabashed about taking stereotypical romcom tropes and breaking them down. I ended up disliking Joe and Love more this season because of all of that (plus a lot of their actions just seemed stupid and illogical). Meanwhile, I started off hating a lot of the side characters like Sherry and Cary and ended up liking them in the end.

Henry was just a plot device the entire season and I’m disappointed he was essentially thrown away in the end. Like, really? He has the freaking blood of two murderous psychos and we’re probably never going to see him again. He could have had more importance to the series.

Overall, I’m disappointed with the writing (not the acting, holy hell Penn and Victoria were amazing) and I felt like the pacing was ALL over the place. There were no huge twists like S2 or deconstruction of tropes like S1. Instead of being smart or witty, the show ended up feeling like your cheap, average, run-of-mill thriller series you see everywhere. Disappointed.
Did anyone think it was weird how many times he mentioned Peach? I mean, it was probably only three times total, but way more than his previous victims. I feel like the “Peach is in FBI custody / still alive / witness protection” theory was floated once or twice here, but the choice of Paris for season 4 is interesting. They could have made Marianne be from anywhere, and they chose Peach Salinger’s go-to city. How wild would it be if the writers decided to write her back in with some crazy reason why she lived and stayed hidden?
I'm a bit struck how "Henry" sounds like "Hendy/Henderson"... Would've thought that name would've been crossed off right away... Their baby's name is literally all blood.
Wow, I thought the ending would have been a great series finale, with Joe walking off into the unknown future. Definitely think they should have ended the show while they were ahead, I don’t really see where the writers can take the show from here. 

Overall, I felt like episodes 1-4 & 8-10 were absolutely amazing and super engaging, so I’m okay with excusing how episodes 5-7 were kind of meh.  I agree with others that this season would have benefited a lot more from watching Joe and Love as this killer-crime couple who spies on neighbors and tries to hide their dirty deeds versus the love affair storyline. 

In terms of the affairs, I actually didn’t mind Theo and felt like maybe the audience would have resonated with his storyline more if they leaned more into Love being the bored housewife unsatisfied with how her life turned out and looking at this college student as something fun. I think they toyed with the idea, but they chose to focus on Joe’s perspective instead. 

However, I did not like the Marianne-Joe coupling, and it has nothing to do with Marianne or the actress who played her—I agree with most that the chemistry between them is nothing compared to what Love and Joe brought to the table. With Theo-Love, it makes more sense as to why they wouldn’t have chemistry, especially if the writers leaned more into Love just using him as a way to spice up her life (and maybe as a way not to kill? Could have been an interesting take)

One more thing I will note is that the final dinner scene between Love & Joe, where she talks about how she was protecting him, doing everything for him, etc. brought a lot of parallels to how Joe spoke about Beck. It was interesting to see the script flipped on him, and I think it brought the storylines from the past three seasons full circle. Again, I definitely think this finale could have been a series finale. 

All in all, I will probably watch the next season of You, but I don’t see myself getting as invested in the show as I have been. Will probably watch it in the background of whatever chores I have to do, but I don’t really see the show reaching the same heights as season 1 and 2.
I am extraordinarily happy that Mathew, Theo, and the Conrads didn’t die.
Why the fuck did Cary and Sherry not ask Theo to go get help/call the cops instead of wasting time looking for the key when Love could be there any minute?
This season had high highs and really confusing lows. It has Heathers “dear diary my teen angst bullshit has a body count,” energy with someone dying or getting attacked pretty much every damn episode.

What I loved about Love in season 2 was how composed she was so that you were shocked by the twist at the end. In this season, she’s just completely unhinged from start to finish and it just felt like such a stark and unconvincing change to her character. The acting from Penn and VP was absolutely phenomenal though. Despite how silly some of the plot lines were, I somehow believed them. Bummed VP will be gone next season.
im surprised so many people disliked this season, because i really liked this season (moreso the first half). From what I remember of last season, I liked this one way much more. Hated that she died, but it’s different from the last two.
I thought with the whole polyamory angle that they were going to end this season with Joe and Love accepting that Joe will be obsessed with someone else and use them as an outlet, while Love has affairs to make herself feel "wild" again. You know, keep them together but accept themselves for who they are.

But I guess it's hard to sell actual character development with two insane serial killers playing house.
Joe keeps calling love a psycho but he’s literally just as bad
Damn, like I knew Joe would kill Love in the end, but I really wanted Love to kill Joe. His hypocrisy was more irritating than normal this season. Love was the driving force of the more interesting story lines. Once the Marianne stuff started, Joe’s plotline was just so repetitive. Which from a narrative perspective, we already know that this is Joe’s pattern. A hot girl looks at him once and he starts stalking her. But it wasn’t as interesting this time
Hoping he will get arrested soon. I find it hard to believe anybody can get away with this much killing .
I can’t help but feel this season was just wasted Potential

They killed Natalie so quick she could have been an interesting character

They wasted Scott Speedman as an actor

Love died which sucks because she was a great character

Joe didn’t even take Henry with him that could’ve been an interesting dynamic for Season 4

Unless they bring back Jenna Ortega and Tati Gabrielle in Season 4 I don’t see what their plan is.

The one thing I do not want to see is Joe Stalking and killing people for another season it’s gotten old.
Mistake to get rid of an actress like Victoria Pedretti, just saying. Hate Love all you want but her performance was mesmerizing in every single scene. I look forward to s4 just for the bat shit insanity is entertaining but they had a chance to change this away from Joe seeking out someone new every season to something sustainable by doing a couple seasons with Joe and Love as a killer couple and having it blow up later rather than in one season.

Just saying. Either way, I ate a lot of popcorn at the insanity.
[deleted]
I feel like the show missed a huge opportunity to change the premise of the show by bringing Love & Joe's relationship into the focus. I had high expectations after the first three episodes but it really fizzled out soon after.
They went completely off the book maybe that’s why this season felt so repetitive
i didn't like that ending ):
Whats Joes hold up on having wanted a baby girl so bad?
I like that Joe had a new girl to obsess over because it goes into his stalker personality. He finds a girl and obsesses over them, stalks them, says they're his soulmate. Then the rush of it ends and he finds a flaw in them, gets bored, and finds someone new. But he was trapped with Love who has a similar mindset of him and can see him fully to give that Love. So what went wrong there? 

Well they said he didn't agree with her killing unjustifiably. They have 2 different killing styles. But at the end of the day they're both murderers and Joe stayed because his only bit of good is that he cares for children deeply. So then why was he so negligent with his own son? Just because it's a boy and he was disappointed the boy would be the same? That's lazy writing...the way Joe's character was developed, he would have fought to instill everything he wanted as a kid for his own. Protect his own son the way he protects completely random kids. They should have had the point of contention between Love and Joe being a difference in opinion of the way he was being raised. Made the two killers tango more and clash in their personalities of raising a child, mixing Joe's stalking obsession in the mix. Instead of having the easy option of Love cheating with Theo they should have made it so that way she was trying to replace him as forty since she couldn't get over the loss of him. Have Theo be a nuisance to Joe the way forty was, cause a rift between the two and then end up with Joe being disgusted with Love that way. At least draw it out more to make it make sense why someone who fully accepts him is just tossed out for 2 new random obsessions. 

I was even hoping for a plot twist of Marian or however you spell her name to sense danger with Love and throat punch her. Reveal a dark edgy side to her too where she got the upper hand and saw Joe and didn't save him out of disgust and got away. Then leave the 2 plotting and planning over it. Idk.
Did they change writers? It does not feel like the same series we have watched in the past. Only up to episode 5 but it is quite flat right now…
Are we 100% sure that Love is dead? She knew enough about that drug to grow it and used it in the past to kill her husband (very predictable), but could she have built up a resistance to it or something over the years or took the cure as well like Joe and then got out of the house when he left? It wouldn't be the first time he thought someone was dead who wasn't actually dead. We never actually saw her body burn. She could have had another body waiting as she had a similar plan to fake her own death after killing him. I'm just brainstorming.
A counter to the “they ruined Love this season” argument:

I agree Love was a very likeable character for most of season 2, and a very unlikeable one in season 3. However, at the end of season 2 it became clear that the person Love was on the outside was nothing like who she truly was. Ironically similar to how Joe puts on a facade and underneath has all these unhealthy obsessions and justifications for terrible things, the writing made it clear that Love mirrors that. I thought that part was actually really great and the perfect way to ferry poetic justice to Joe. The reason she and Joe could never be was because she shattered Joe’s fantasies and showed him exactly who he was, and he refused to accept that. He would rather keep moving on to his next ideal fantasy woman, believing hes her knight in shining armor, than accept who he really is.

I’m not super happy with where the show went this season either. I was hoping he would finally get what he deserved, definitely not that he continues being a masterminded savant built to get out of sticky situations. I think if season 4 doesnt end with everything truly blowing up in Joe’s face it’s going to be extremely repetitive, as it already has been. “He cant keep getting away with it!!!” In Jessie pinkmans voice, in my head, the entire show.
I feel like love was written so poorly. She doesn’t seem to be written as a woman who’s been married before. She seems so much more immature compared to last season. Granted If it was just a couple ep I would’ve assumed it was post partum love but this season love is so careless and downright stupid. I get the whole getting by the scrape of their teeth but the whole argument where she blabs she killed the neighbor is just sooooo idk 1 dimensional and lazily written imo. First eps were great and legit engaging really fell off after that. Overall disappointing season. The trailer for this season really focused on the murdered neighbor all for what 3 eps???
Honestly the whole bakery thing doesn’t make any sense to me. They had that thing up and running in a week, constantly stacked with baked goods, and I didn’t see one other employee the entire time.
Can someone explain how the fuck >!Matthew analysed the entire surveillance footage of Madre Linda,not to mention with a face recognition algorithm, Working for months in his office, yet still managed to miss what Theo found out in literally minutes?!<
They really ruined Love like that smh
This season had a lottttt of impulsive drama that made no sense but I don’t see how that’s different from previous seasons 🤣 I don’t watch this show for the writing, I watch it because the actors are typically on point for their characters and I love watching Joe’s growing self-awareness. I also love that despite his self-awareness, he still gets stuck in the same patterns. It’s really relatable to me. 

Penn Badgley’s acting is so good, like he makes the whole show come to life for me. His acting plus the commentary on our current social media culture is why I keep coming back to this show. 

“Publicity has a way of flattening, flattening you and the people you love into types, and it's really hard to deal with because nobody will ever let you forget what happened.” - Love

One of the most offhand but interesting quotes from the season to me. I read a book called Severance that made a similar statement about the internet creating a “flattening of time” - a space where we go to visit the past. Idk I’m really into the impact of tech on our mental health so those little tidbits that make me think keep me around for “You”. 

Have nooooooooooo frikin idea what season 4 will be like, but Joe walking around France in those trousers was prettttty hot. They fit him so well
It'd be cool if Theo is in season 4. He knows Joe was heavily involved with Natalie's death. And he knows Love is crazy, but he probably knew her well enough to know that she wouldn't off herself. Theo cared a lot for Love. What if for season 4, Theo starts becoming obsessed with uncovering the truth. He probably knows something isn't right and that Joe isn't really dead- so many he goes off to find Joe and have him pay for what he did to Love
I really do hate how Joe does nothing to conceal his identity (shave head, grow a beard, etc) he just throws on a hat and calls it a day? 

And sure, he’s presumed dead because of his toes (one being thrown into a pie in the oven) alluding to Love being a cannibal, but come on. That Paris scene, he could’ve done more. 

I loved Love in this season, and I wish they would have done more as a couple, instead of arguing about who’s right and who’s wrong. They’re both shit, the least they could do is admit it to one another and have a reason to get rid of people together.
Am I the only one that wished Love killed joe and become the main character / villain of the show ?
Joe needs to stop writing a poetic suicide letter for every other person he murders, it's gonna get him caught eventually... peach? gill? love? and they all sound like they were penned by him, in the same similar tone to beck's final book
! light spoiler warning ¡

what the fuck did I just finish watching…wow kinda disappointed if am being completely honest! this season felt very hectic in a bad way not many good plot twist other than the first episode death and a lot of plots were predictable 

furthermore, with the expectation of Joe’s coworkers and maybe Theo none of the side characters were likable and only in the last episodes did I find sherry and her husband HILARIOUS when they were caged lol! Also the body count this season was HIGH which isn’t bad but also there were a lot more of the sexy scenes but, don’t get me wrong Victoria P is gorgeous so I didn’t mind it that much. I am a diehard fan of this show but this season felt off
Ok, so I've let these thoughts percolate of the show. People seem to hate on Beck in Season 1, and are full-on sympathizing with Joe in Season 3, partly because Love is so unhinged. 

In case anyone missed the finale of Season 1 and then moved on to the next Seasons, as Beck says, "Yes, but it was *my* life." Beck and every other human on the planet has the absolute right to be a worthless trash fire contributing nothing to society, nevermind their own health and wellbeing, without being stalked, kidnapped, abused, and killed. Indeed, if Caroline Kepnes has a "point" to make, other than to tell a good story, it's that. A woman doesn't need to be a paragon of virtue and a Nobel Laureate to not deserve what Joe has in store for them. 

In fact, I was really worried that this was going to be a by-product of Season 1, focusing on the internal monologue of a sociopathic, narcissistic killer like Joe Goldberg. Just like how people sympathized with Walter White or the Punisher, that they would look at Joe as someone who maybe has a point, and that it's these women who are ultimately at fault for their own demise. 

I have to say Season 2 gave me some hope that that might not happen, as Joe's meditations on Dostoyevsky and the last shred of his consciousness tries to get him to understand that what he did was wrong, right up until the season finale. 

But in Season 3, some people seem convinced that since Love is a raging trash fire less psychologically and emotionally stable than Ramsay Snow, that that somehow justifies Joe's actions. Joe *fuels* Love's instability. Granted, Love was never dealing with a full deck given her family's inability to deal appropriately with literally anything, but Joe actively dumped fuel on the fire through the episode. In this case the comparison to Walter White is apt, and the way the fandom intensely hated on Skylar. 

He's complex as any character who has three seasons of television devoted to his biography can be, that said he's not *that* complex. He's a narcissist *obsessed with control,* living in a perverted fantasy world of his own delusion. He views himself as the hero, a literal white knight, yet connects the moment he saved his mother from her abuser with her simultaneous abandonment of him, which is why he tries literally everything to help those he becomes obsessed with away from their view. 

Go rewatch Season 2, you can pinpoint the *exact second* Joe's obsession with Love ends: the moment she reveals that she's been controlling him and not vice-versa. And Season 3 is all of that extended outward: Joe trying to regain absolute, total control, and falling back into a pattern. Some people seem almost a bit upset that Joe found a new someone to obsess over, without seeming to acknowledge or understand that people with personality and attachment disorders, without help, are completely subject to these kinds of patterns of behavior. 

There were quite a few weird plot holes in S3, and I think they actually did take it into some interesting directions. That said, the patterns, as someone who's experienced loved ones with similar disorders (minus the murders as far as I'm aware) they nailed the pattern repetition, the lying, the fueling of the domestic disturbance to a T.
I found myself wondering if I talk too much about keto.
Sure, Love was a hypocrite, but so was Joe. I think the point is that they're the same and he was "meeting his match". He hated her so much because it was like looking in a mirror. He still hates the murderous part of himself so as soon as he saw that in Love, he gave up on her. He doesn't actually want someone smart, he doesn't want someone who could challenge him, he wants to be able to control someone's life. Love had autonomy, which was his greatest fear.
Man all these rich folks using uber and lyft you know those fucks don't tip.
The final scene where Sherry and Cary got to TedEx fucking killed me. As expected, but damn their relationship is god tier and her lines were always funny as hell.
Joe didn't abandon Henry because it's the best for Henry. He abandoned the kid so he can get a fresh start himself. If he had taken Henry away with him, he couldn't have faked his own death. 

It just shows that Joe is an unrealizable narrator who always uses excuses to justify his own actions and perhaps lies to himself to avoid admitting how terrible of a person he is. 

We can't trust what his monologue says. When it says something along the lines of "To help and protect YOU, I need to get rid of xxx." Bullshit. More like "In order to possess YOU, I need to get rid of anyone else in the way. I'll kill anyone else who mentally has power over you so I can be your sole manipulator" 🙄🙄🙄 

Whoever still thinks he did what he did for Love and still have a crush on him need to WAKE UP. I'm sick of seeing that.
My feelings on this season are very mixed. On one hand, I thought most of the first half was great. The focus on the dysfunction of Joe and Love's relationship was so much fun, and really gave Penn and Victoria the chance to show off their acting chops. However, the second half was just ridiculous to me. I'm normally able to suspend my disbelief for pretty much anything, but the body count that Joe and Love rack up is insane. How am I supposed to believe they weren't caught? And next season is gonna be Joe in Paris? What? I unfortunately don't really have any interest in Season 4 if it's going to revolve around Marienne, as she was just an incredibly flat character. Shame.
I’m still watching and am disappointed in the season
Did anyone else notice how unfocused it would show on the sides and then focus on their faces only. I don’t know why but this bugged me so much.
This isn’t very relevant but why are Love’s parents now divorced and basically hate each other in this season? I thought they said in season 2 how in love they were and even got remarried or got their vows renewed(?). Have I missed something?
Just binge watched the whole season today and Love had to go, she was dropping bitches left and right, girl was out of control 

Love her though and will miss her from the show

Sherry and Cary in the box was one of my fav parts of the season and I’m really happy that a lot of the characters I liked didn’t die
Love's character was ruined the moment she hooked up with Theo
[deleted]
I just watched the whole thing in a day and I like… couldn’t stop watching but am really not a fan of Joe killing Love and leaving her for Marienne. Like, Victoria is a fantastic actress and I loved her… I was hoping she wasn’t actually dead a la Candace and Joe doesn’t say she had a funeral or anything so I guess it’s possible! But then recycling the same thing does seem lazy.
wait can someone explain why joe wanted a daughter and not a son
I enjoyed this season honestly. It's a very entertaining show to me.

One thing that bothers me about Joe is, why does everyone want to be his friend and why does every girl seem to want to have sex with him? If we didn't have his narration, I'd think he was just a pretty boring and quiet person with no personality.
I personally loved the part when she hit the antivaxxer over the head. Justified.
>! Hate the ending why did he kill love , if the show end here it will be good but if they continue they dragging it !<
Cary is the only side character i’m fucking with, god bless him.  I love that they’re managing to portray his toxic masculinity in a way that both shows he’s still got a lot of good traits and isn’t all toxic while simultaneously fitting him into the lovable oaf role.
This show is so ridiculous now I can’t even take it seriously
I’ll miss Love she was entertaining. Show can be so messy and insane but I can’t stop watching and it’s so much fun to watch
My thoughts:

-Sherry & Cary’s relationship is quite impressive
-Love was annoying and caused most of the main problems for them this season (I know she was a plot driver, but In a character sense she was annoying to me) 
-Marianne is so pretty
-This season was good. 
-Joe will forever be Joe
I know a lot of people are complaining about Joe doing the same thing over and over again but they also forget how incredibly realistic that characters thought pattern is in terms of mental illness such as sociopathy or even narcissism. People with personality disorders are just that disordered. They repeat patterns and expect different outcomes only to be saddened that they still feel alone and empty. 

Joe could never truly stay with Love because she was mirroring back all the things he hates about himself. He needs someone flawed but selfless and insecure which is why the Librarian made sense. They didn’t have crazy passion but he was literally looking for any escape in his delusional mind from a marriage to basically himself. Anyone who has dated someone flawed in this way knows that they could never survive being married to someone just like them.
Am I the only one who notices that like when the camera is focusing on one person in a scene, everything else in the background kind of seems blurred? Feels like maybe it’s building to something. (Only on the sixth episode)
I found season 3 unenjoyable to watch, almost didn’t make it through the entire season. I found it anticlimactic, predictable, and a bit cringey at times.
The predictable plot and unlikable characters just made it so hard to watch. 

The goal of this season was to clearly make Love as intolerable and insufferable as possible. We needed to hate Love so that Joe remains likable and almost forgivable. He is, after all, the star of the show and well we can’t have a female steal the show away from the “hot” possessive, and toxic man everyone loves the most. Besides the show needed Loves impulsive behavior to give Joe an escape plan from the “boring suburban life” they both hated so much. Everyone hated Love the entire season as if he isn’t just as horrible as Love he’s just more put together. At least with Love she’s more unpredictable. Joe is so predictable I absolutely KNEW he would kill Love for Marianne. Once he says that bull shit about “I’d do anything for YOU” he means it. One thing Joe is, is consistent and his obsession will always, ALWAYS, drive him to kill anyone who stands in the way of his obsession. His plans never work out and he always has to kill the woman he “loves”. Again, THE PATTERN IS PREDICTABLE. 

How is this town so high tech they have fucking rings that check your vitals but failed to do surveillance on the bakery where she was last seen alive at as well as where he last txt messages pinged at? How did a 19 year old kid figure it out before the fucking cops? The same cops who managed to get footage of Natalie handing Joe condoms in a parking lot but not footage of him driving her fucking car away from the murder scene? No way he wiped that car clean of all his forensic evidence he didn’t even wear gloves. The axe they planted had fingerprints on it but no fucking blood from the victim? Makes no sense to me. You can wipe blood up and it’ll still show. The husband was right to obsess over the fucking holes because the job was sloppy as hell and it’s obvious the show was headed in one direction, Joes freedom. 

I don’t even want to watch the next season because I feel like it’s just going to be me watching Joe obsess over another crush and fucking stalk people with his stupid hat (as if the hat makes him fucking invisible) and barely get away with murder again and again. Theo is just going to hold on to the evidence he has because he believes that Love was innocent or whatever and that’s gonna be a little plot twist for next season.

I have to say my favorite part was when he kept getting caught stalking Ryan. I fucking laughed and just got excited about the fact that he’s being called out on how he’s terrible at stalking people. I almost thought for a second that Natalie was a set up because of how fast her storyline moved but that’s what made me realize the whole plan was to make Love as insufferable and unhinged as possible. Which meant she’d be dead or framed for EVERYTHING by the end of this season because Joe was never going to change. 

Anyways my opinion doesn’t even matter.
 People in TV shows make me sick. If you have information that someone committed a crime, call the police. Don't confront them or warn other people. It's like you want to die. 




Theo, you poor brainwashed child.




I underestimated Sherry. I appreciate her character and I didn't expect that
Well that was quick..
Me peacefully sleeping at night knowing that I’m single 😴
After the cliffhanger of season 2 I had low hopes for season 3. I loved the ride though, but it's a bit of a mixed bag.

The start was great, the dynamic between Love and Joe is amazing. The character development between her, him and the new cast was good also.

Joe questioning himself was great for the series, I'm just disappointed the writers just threw his self criticism away when they half-assedly wrote in Marienne and he's basically back to square one, with a lot of wasted money on therapy sessions.

It almost felt like the writers are too scared to take Joe off the hunt and the second part of the season suffered for it in my opinion.
I was pretty bored with all the back and forth regarding their failing marriage, affairs, killing everyone on the town in a fit of rage & not being suspected etc.

It felt like too many things were happening at once and when Joe "you-d" Marienne i was honestly done at that point. 

The ending was pretty predictable but I feel so unsatisfied after finishing s3. It feels like they could have gotten rid of some aspects (sherry& cary in the cage - that whole swinging thing was weird) and it might have been better paced.
Was I the only one cringing at Theo the entire season? Dude had no game, no actual ability to chat and recklessly in love. Man I just wanted him to just go away and take love already cause that plot line was getting hard to watch
Maybe a bit farfetched, but perhaps the reason Love didn't tell Joe what she did with the bodies is because she used one in her place before escaping the fire. 

Based on how people are upset with Love's death, I wouldn't be surprised if writers were reading these comments and deciding if they should bring back Love for S4, and having an unfilled plot hole about Love's disposal of the bodies is juuuuust convenient enough to explain her re-arrival next season.
Is Love REALLY dead?
Be careful Joe, if you read too much Great Gatsby to Henry. He might start calling everyone Old Sport, and then at that point he basically is Forty
I loved this season and I think a lot of the reasons people are so negative about it is because season 4 cannot be a complete reset. I am begging you YOU team please do not just re do season one but this time in French. I don’t know about anyone else but I’m ready to see Joe actually battle with the police, have some podcast or whatever connect all his past murders make him kill some people in Paris so it becomes like an international manhunt. I don’t know just something to stop it from just being Joe stalks girl.
Never like Love. Not upset over the ending. She was doing too much. The show doesn’t need two serial killers. Honestly, S1 is still the best. S3 was trying too hard and failed. Hopefully S4 will be when all of Joe’s history will catch up to him.
I enjoyed this season as a whole, but IMO the parts with Love and Joe in therapy were the most interesting. Having them work on their issues together, badly, would have been great. Instead there was a time jump and both characters changed again, losing that progress.
So am I the only one who thought it was really weird how Love had sex with a teenager, even acknowledging he was a teenager mere moments before having public sex with him in a park? Like imagine a grown adult man doing that with a teenaged girl. And acknowledging the age gap before doing so. Yikes.
How good was Victoria Pedretti's performance this season? She's absolutely smashed it out the park, so convincing. One of the best characters in tv, Penn was incredible as usual. Its sad that Love won't return, it surprised me how good they wrote her character.
 Did anyone else tear when Joe left Henry with Dante? I felt like that was the ultimate growth for him, just that perhaps he has yet to realise it. To love someone deeply is to free them from your toxic clutches, instead of obsessing over them and holding on to them.
I literally spent that whole final dinner scene stressing because i thought the "chicken" was henry BAHAHAH
I know it’s impossible… but I am low key hoping there’s some way Love survived and season 4 has her stalking Joe for revenge/reconciliation.


Also, I honestly would have preferred Love to have survived and framed joe for everything and the next season could have had her replace joe as our protagonist.
I was on board with the beginning of this season, but feel like it nose dived so quickly. Spoilers of course:

>!I know Joe is a psychopath whose obsessions come from his imagination and they aren't supposed to make sense but I still couldn't buy into his obsession with Marienne. If anything, I felt like he had a billion times more chemistry with Natalie, who was indeed actively seducing him. Part of me wonders what the show would have looked like if they had switched the characters: if he had a misguided obsession woth Marienne first stemming from the "we like books connection" and then she died first and the rest of the season was about his growing obsession with Natalie. I think they could have easily woven in the same storylines like the camera spying, etc!<

>!Regarding the focus of the season, I felt that the interplay between Joe and Love was what made is so fun to watch. You basically have two crazy ass murderers who believe in their own righteousness because of their sick sense of morality and justice. Victoria Pedretti killed it (haha get it?) and Love serving as an equal, but different character than Joe was so great to watch. That's why it was so disappointing to me when Love tried to kill Joe and then Joe successfully killed Love: it felt like they just pissed away that interesting dynamic in an instant. I was actually hoping that Love would kill Marienne and continue on with her insane plan to make Joe love her and see how that would play out - maybe in some kind of nuclear detente situation where they hold each others secrets hostage and recognize they could have killed each other (but didn't)!<

>!I also didn't really buy Joe's growing unhappiness. He was so quick to reverse course and support Love after she killed Natalie but so quick to kill off Love for Marienne. It just felt like his obsession levels are inconsistent, if that makes sense!<

This was a fun watch but I think it's inevitable that the next season will be garbage. I have really low expectations
Joe is a hypocrite smh he needs to realize love is the one smh
Of all the things I didn’t like from this season, these are the worst to me: 

1. Joe’s character arc. He goes from not being able to connect with Henry to connecting with him to having a happy marriage and then to falling for Marienne. 

2. Marienne. Candace, Guinevere and Love all were interesting, well-developed, three-dimensional and had attractive personalities; they were not just pretty faces. Marienne on the other hand… she was mopey and boring. Nothing about her really stood out to me. She took off her bracelet, Joe thinks “she’s flirting with me”, and next thing you know he’s completely smitten. I mean… she’s nothing special, and Joe apparently is such a simp that he’ll fall madly in love with any girl who gives him more than a modicum of attention. That sucked. 

3- To me, Joe went from a well-intentioned homicidal psychopath to a psychotic douche. Kinda wish he gets shot next season!
I was definitely not expecting that ending. Felt bad for Henry. But also relieved that he's in good hands. Since the series got renewed for S4, I was kinda suspicious. But it was really hard to absorb that.
Just finished it in one day. 

I think Love was kind of gas lighting Joe in some of the episodes. For instance, when Love was interested to have an open marriage just like Cary and Sherry. She then gets triggered as she watches Joe & Sherry doing the deed. And then, she blames it on Joe. 

P.S. there are other instances from the season where Joe was being gaslighted by Love Quinn.
I don’t think Love is dead. Marianne is so boring in comparison to Love and she doesn’t bring out any type of difference in Joe. Love made Joe step out his comfort zone and show us a different side of him. Here’s what I think: 

Love isn’t dead. Remember all of those close ups they did of her body while Joe was staging the scene? Plus, they don’t even trust each other. When they were setting up the cage, they both hid keys in case one needed to get out. Even though Joe is more calculated, Love knows him better than anyone else. I’m sure she’d prepare herself at all cost knowing that Joe would do the same. 

If she is alive: 

She would find out Joe is in Paris and the roles  would be reversed. She’ll be the crazy stalker waiting to catch Joe while Joe is finally happy with Marianne. I don’t know how and if this can stretch out for 10 episodes, but I think they’ll probably kill Joe off or they’ll both die together. 

Poor Henry, though. It made sense to give him away but Joe is more concerned with Marianne and her daughter than his own child. Love should get justice for both her & Henry.
Too many comments to read so I apologize if this was already noted, but.... all the stuff with the nurse from his childhood felt very forced and unnecessary. It's like the writers knew they already drilled to death how desperate and unfit his mother was, at the hands of abusing men, and how vastly affected Joe was by it;

So they were like "Okay, how do we somehow introduce a *different* woman is his childhood with the same shit going on to further drive this very obvious point home"
So I guess the Pee still isn't coming back to bite Joe?
Without love I don’t think the show will be the same idk if I’ll watch the next season I don’t like Maryanne as much as I liked the Bonnie and Clyde love and joe dynamic
Really enjoyed it.  I also enjoyed that there were more facets to their lives and characters.  Multi-layers here.  Dark humor for commentary on society as a whole, exploring how everyone navigates the mundane part of family and marriage (and what do people who need all encompassing love and adoration like these two do to cope), the facade that most people wear.  Most people have a secret.  

I loved the dark humor of dealing with the gluten-free and oat milk crowd and cackled uproariously at Love dealing with the anti-vaxxer bullshit and its hilarious commentary on the Covid vaxx to boot.  I loved what I thought was an homage to Breaking Bad with the poisonous flowers growing under your nose.  They’re giving Joe a fresh start to go back to the original Joe for Season 4, which will be very interesting to see now that he has gained insight into what makes him tick through some self-awareness and reflection.  Penn B and Victoria P are great actors.
Kind of wish this is where the show ended, with Toeless Joe taking Henry to France and ambiguously suggesting that Joe is gonna stalk Marianne again.

However, since it’s already been renewed, here’s what I’m hoping for:

•It will be the last season.

•Joe will start a full descent into madness, meaning…

•Love will still be a main character. I need more Victoria Pedretti, and I’d rather have a Hannah Baker in 13RW Season 2 situation than lose her altogether.

•Ellie comes back! Maybe Marianne starts piecing together that Love was scapegoated, tracks down Ellie and they work together with Matthew to take him out… which means…

•They find Joe… and Ellie kills him. 😅
Season 3 was better than Season 1 but not as good as Season 2 in my opinion. What made Season 2 so great was that it built upon Joe's story but also took it in new directions. Old ghosts with Beck come back to haunt him and created a genuine challenge to get out of, and the new chase with Love kept you constantly engaged. S2's ending also brought a twist I never saw coming and the entire plot was just a stroke of genius to me. Season 1 was entertaining, don't get me wrong, but Season 2 made You one of my favorite shows. And although Season 3 was still really good, it could have been much stronger.

First of all, it didn't tie in very much to the previous seasons in the way that S2 did, besides Love being there. This isn't inherently a problem but the idea of You becoming a show where Joe just keeps going from city to city, changing names and just doing the same thing over and over again is going to get old quickly. I want some plot progression and consequences like S2 had!

Secondly, the suburban world and new characters of Madre Linda weren't nearly as interesting as the first two seasons, either (there's no one as engaging as Forty or Ellie this season). What I like most about You is the thriller aspect, and spending the first half of the season stuck in the vapid dramas of suburbia hurt the season for me. Things don't really get going until the 4th episode with Gil, and shortly after with Marienne.

Thirdly, although the ending had a pretty cool montage and I like the idea of how Joe tied up loose ends and went off to Paris, I don't like how Marienne just shows up, never finds Joe and then disappears and somehow Joe can never find her again? Again, I liked the ending itself but I was hoping that Love would do more than she did. She went down a little too easily. Previous finales felt like more of a challenge for Joe to get out of.

Maybe my standards for the show are just a bit too high, but after Season 2 I was expecting greatness and instead what I got felt like You by-the-numbers, which is still really good! All the moments I was supposed to feel tense I did (like in Episode 8 when Joe and Love come back upstairs after accidentally spilling the beans or Joe stabbing Love with the shot at the end), and all the moments I was supposed to feel surprised I did (when Gil hung himself in the cage and they gave us a well filmed and moody episode ending with the rain), but I just didn't feel the pure thrill I got during Fear and Loathing in Beverly Hills or PI Joe this season. Hopefully next season they'll be able to match or top that (maybe even get Theo, Ellie and some detectives involved to get Joe's sins to catch up to him) but in the meantime I can say I was still really satisfied with what they did  (I watched it all in one night, so that speaks for itself lol). Good work.
How on earth did joe afford the money to move to Paris and how on earth did he leave the country when he is on the news as a ‘dead man’
Idk about you guys, but I didn’t believe that Joe was in love with Marienne. Felt forced. Love and Theo was a little better, and felt more realistic, but as he kept doing those monologues about “You” (Marienne), it felt so wrong
Lets be honest, everyone here is only upset because they are obsessed with Victoria Pedretti! 🙂😀
How does Joe even fly to France??? Don't think he could just use his passport and fly off while being presumably dead
I am loving the dig at antivaxxers in this season. However it seems to be a slow progression to other seasons!
Already got spoiled for me since I wanted to be nosy and read the interview that Victoria did 🤦🏽‍♂️
Very mixed on this season. Loved the beginning. Loved the ending. Loved the dynamic between "Impulsive Psycho" Love and "Totally-well-put-together-bro-trust-me" Joe. Loved that they shoved Natalie out the door after one episode. Loved the therapy sessions. Loved Sherry and Cary, even earlier on when they were serving as villains.

But this season had WAY too much going on all at once and by the end I was exhausted. Marienne was fine but I did not like how she just fell backwards into being Joe's new love interest for the rest of the season. She was interesting but NOT because of that, and I feel they completely misused her. Side effect made Ryan a waste of time and it felt like he was only thrown in there to bump Joe's kill count. But what I hated the most was the retcon about James; in Season 2 there was a bubble of innocence and sweetness in their story that made me believe Love's craziness came from a place of genuine love. Now it's just "Oops! Killed him too LOL". Cool. That story didn't need to be touched. Now I don't care.
Anyone else super relieved >!Theo survived? He seemed like a genuinely good person who got in way over his head. I'm glad he and his dad are mending the relationship as well - a bright spot in the final moments.!< Also Sherry and Cary were hilarious they went from annoying to the best side characters of season 3. It was also really fun to have the dynamic of 2 Joe's with Love in this season - she was almost like a messier version of Joe. >!I understand why her arc had to end but it was fun while it lasted.!<
Love, I was rooting for you. We were ALL rooting for you. I just can't believe you keep on throwing way your life like that. I can't take it anymore. I really wanted you and Joe to be the psychotic ex-murderers couple that controls each other but honestly, it's tiring. 

That's all I came here to say.
Genuinely don't know where they go from here. Love and the baby brought an interesting dynamic to a show that was threatening to get stale, but with both out of the picture, is it just gonna be more of Joe's obsessive stalker shenanigans but in yet another new setting? Don't know if I'm down for that. If I'm being honest everything with Joe and Marienne was honestly the least interesting part of this season. The idea that the show has hit the reset button on all the actually interesting stuff that emerged from season 2 and 3, just to give us more of a dynamic that was already so stale that they had to subvert our expectations of it in the opening episode doesn't exactly entice me back.
Is it just me or did loves murders seem way more Impulsive and all over the place compared to joes? Also do you y’all think joe will stop murdering in season four? He always talks about not going back to his old self and trying to control his urges? I feel like he’s definitely going to get killed in season 4 since he had to disfigure himself just to escape this season.
You season 3 was just so messy. There were so many times I thought: would this character really do that. Love's choices ended up making no sense sometimes. Even though she is such a smart character she forgets finding out bout Joe thinking about someone else. She never suspects late nights, ignores all the excuses & doesn't even try to look into what he is up to. Even though it's obvious she doesn't trust him. The killings were too random, & had no weight to any character other than maybe the depressed husband Matthew. Other seasons had more reason & heart to the madness
To me, parts with librarian girl were pretty boring and kind of unnecessary
About episode 3 I started to realise that Joe/Love just wasn’t going to work out, they were both too crazy and too psychotic (as individuals), no matter how perfect they were for each other. I knew one of them was eventually going to have to be killed off, and I knew it was going to be Love (I mean, it’s “Joe’s series” after all), but I kept holding out the hope that somehow Love would be the one to make it out alive… I was really angry and sad when she died. She turned into such an interesting character. I wanted to see more of her and her story. Now we have to watch a whole new season of Joe chasing another “you” and most likely murdering her again 🙄
Something extremely inconsequential that I can’t stop wondering: why did the writers make Theo the stepson of Matthew and not just his son from his first marriage? Just seems like a weird, unnecessary detail.
Season 4, Episode 1:  We quickly learn through flashbacks that Love and Sherry staged the entire admission of Love having murdered Natalie during the swinging session (it turns out Sherry's marriage was on the rocks and Love had the idea to fake abduct them and lock them in the cage to work through their issues -- which ultimately worked to perfection). That's why Love so easily subdued Sherry, who we had just learned knew Krav Maga, while Joe was tracking down Cary (the show will overlook the obviously calculated risk that things could have gone poorly and Cary could have easily killed Joe).  

In exchange for orchestrating this plot for Sherry, Love also wanted Joe to think the whole thing was real in order to try and reignite a spark in their relationship. This is why, among other details, Love expertly told Joe that Sherry would scratch her arm if she was lying (that was all staged to deepen Joe's buy in). Love knew that the whole swinging thing wasn't going to actually fix their marriage, but thought that another hopelessly complicated violent abduction might do the trick -- just like old times. What better way for them to need each other than a whole new round of self-preservation, right? Indeed, Joe and Love have the best sex of their lives in the bakery basement right after the abduction. Mission accomplished (for the moment) and Love moves on to thinking about babies (while giving Sherry medical supplies and delicious food and seemingly inexplicably carrying on with mundane shit like school admissions letters).  

From there, we learn that things actually did start to go awry, with Matthew and Theo meddling and Love learning that Joe was having an affair, which sends her off the deep end. The final episode plays out mostly as we witnessed, save for one detail. Right after Sherry and Cary find the key and escape from the dungeon, Sherry gets "Love's" farewell email/confession (actually sent by Joe), realizes that something is terribly wrong, and races over to their house where she pulls Love from the burning house just in time. As an avid user of all manner of chemical uppers and downers (which we saw during swingers night), Sherry has ready access to a shot of adrenaline and gives it to Love to try and save her (which, just as it saved Joe, easily saved Love as well, at least as far as show logic goes). Recognizing that everyone thinks she's a murderer, Love (with Sherry's help) takes the same path as Joe and goes along with being "dead". With Matthew's web of community surveillance having been conveniently eliminated, Love's escape from Madre Linda attracts zero scrutiny.     

The show then reminds keen listeners that Joe tells us at the end of S3 that his body was presumed to have have been "butchered or worse", except for his two toes which proved to the police that he was dead. Let's forget about the ridiculous assertion that the toe he stuck directly in the middle of the fire could have survived and provided DNA evidence, and focus on what he didn't tell us... anything at all about Love's remains. All we know is that "people were ravenous for her" and she became "a bit of a folk hero." Indeed, we learn early in S4E1 that the distinct lack of any trace of Love has been the biggest driver of the folk hero narrative, and a whole group of internet sleuths (including some carryovers from r/FreeDrNicky) have taken up the cause of proving she's still alive. In an effort to minimize public alarm, the police (in true You fashion) have taken the path of least resistance in (publicly, at least) stating that Love almost surely burned up in the fire and is no longer a threat. Insert a young rebellious police/FBI agent who disagrees.  

The stage is now set. Joe is in Paris looking for Marienne, Love is trying to stay under the radar and has temporarily stopped obsessing over Joe, and then there's Henry. The one major thing that kept them together before and will ultimately bring them back face to face in S4. And scene.
Seriously the best show on Netflix hands down. I love that Love has met someone as mean as her in Joe. It’s weird watching two absolute psychopaths being overbearing and loving parents. A true contradiction in terms. The fact that psychopaths are so high maintenance and they almost entirely always think only of themselves.
For the longest time I thought o was the only one but I actually wanted Love/Joes relationship to work and be partners in crime but being who they are I can see why it didn’t happen

Love being killed off was absolutely ridiculous and I don’t know where they go from here
Is Ellie set to make an appearance this season. Kinda hope she just pops up lol and Joes obsession with the neighbour omg 🙃
That's eye cream you dumbass stop wasting it on your murdery, unwashed hands. That's like, the one thing I can't get over this season, which says a lot about how underwhelming it was. 

I did not like Love at all in S2 and it seems like the goal of S3 was to make her as unpalatable as possible yet every unhinged moment made me like her even more. I was ready for her to outsmart Joe's ass already and move the series forward. Eventually she would also get caught but would have been a nice final season 4 (maybe 5) with all sorts of justice or wrapped up storylines. But noooooo back to Joe stalking the randomest people and somehow having back up plan after back up plan. So if he didn't casually run across Cary's fun bag, he would've been toast? So many hail mary's from the most out of shape dude, which like why hasn't he started working out yet. Loved that his invisibility hat didn't work on the douche news anchor. 

Kinda got whiplash from how fast Marianne reciprocated his feelings. She seemed smarter and onto him and then she's in love. With Joe?? I know penn Badgley is super hot but damn. Joe says the wrong things all the time, breathes too heavy and is really overbearing. Also presumably he is just staring at people when he goes off into fantasy land which is super awkward probs. Barring the murder stuff, he is obnoxious as hell. Who loves someone after only superficially knowing them for maybe a year max? I'm assuming the timeline is that Henry is about 6 months when Joe starts at the library and then his 1st bday party passes and Joe and Marienne still aren't meshing and then who knows how many months more pass until their kiss. 

Lots of entertaining moments, the Gil thing was unexpected and seemed super fitting with Love's character but tbh I played phone games half the time while watching this just bc everything was so horribly paced. The beginning was good, when it was Joe/Love against the suburban emotional vampires. Then for some reason Love got really into sherry (why??) and Joe got bored and when Joe gets bored we all suffer. 

I hate this show can't wait for season 4.
My ranking per season so far: Season 1>Season 2> Season 3
This show was 100% Love's. Joe felt like a secondary character, probably due to superb acting from Love's actress. 

But I really think it should've ended with >!both of them dying!< and the writers pulling the plug on the show. I want more but I think it would've been good to end it here.
I rlly wanted to see carys dick
I’m a little underwhelmed by the season’s final outcome. >! I was hoping Love wouldn’t die, she was the most fascinating character in the show. Her dynamic with Joe, with all the other characters, her recklessness vs the controlled reactions of Joe… a shame for us viewers she is gone. Joe is getting a little repetitive and it’d be a shame if this became just a rehash of Dexter, where every season there’s a main interest and a bunch of mini bosses for Joe to take care of. With Love the fact that Joe was actually met by an equal nutjob changed the way he went about things. Also, the last episode where Joe has this 4D chess moment of knowing Love’s plan all along… felt very contrived, very scooby-doo !<
I really thought that killing Love wasted near endless narrative potential.


They've gone back to their already tired formula of Joe stalking a chick and trying to help a single mother with an abusive man.


We saw it already 3 TIMES. 



If he finds a new chick he is into, he'll find some other stupid reason why they are soulmates. 

"Oh, THIS lady got locked in a cage like me. It isn't growing up in the system or murder or love of books that matters. Growing up in a cage is the only thing someone can have experienced to understand me".






Now I'm not a writer, but if I were to write this season I would center even more of the conflict around Love's inability to fit in with all of the judgey people. Their need for conflict and a target should have been the thing that appears to initially strain their marriage but actually have it end up being the thing they need to spice things up. Their true frustration with eachother should stem from the initial lack of danger. Natalie was a good start but I would have like to have seen that cause Love to engage in similar less murdery stuff. Petty revenge against the neighbourhood bitches and sabotage and stuff to try and help her business. Maybe by screwing with someone elses? These characters do not fear illegal activity at all. Love should start off that way while Joe does more of his stalking shit and then towards the second half of the season they figure out that the illegal invasive stuff is an activity that can bring them together. 


But they overdo it and get caught which escalates things back to locking up people and murder. Joe can try to use his child as an excuse not to do these things and blame Love when shit goes wrong even when he is just as culpable.

One of the corners the writers wrote themselves into is the fact that none of Joe's covert vigilante stuff needed to be hidden from the wife. The only secret he could have from her that she cared about was him messing with another romantic partner. If he kills some pedo or abuser it don't matter because Love is a murderer too. So they did this obsession with the new chick with the same old personal issues and it just ended up showing us stuff that we have seen before.


The marriage with a partner in crime and the psychotic/hypocritical nature of both characters was hillarious and easily the best part of the season. They could have done more with it.


They can even have a split at the end where they are not romantic partners but just parents who are mortal enemies. At the end of season 2, the dynamic is that Love has a thing for Joe but Joe has lost the magic.

At the end of season 3, you can have them both hate eachother and trying to sabotage eachother but still being married. Love in season 4 could be an even more cunning and invasive force like Candace (who felt really underdeveloped imo). They also should really have Love do more of the Narrative voice, kinda like with Beck in the first season. You barely got anything from her except her inner dialogue with her brother. She is a murderer and manipulator like Joe and yet she had less of the internal narration than Beck who was a much more normal person.


All of the things I mentioned above had their base elements somewhere in this season but they clearly were not confident in straying away from the 'Joe loves forbidden girl" formula.

No implementation of Ellie either? No new jam for her to be in so Joe can rescue her? No revenge from her on Love for killing her sister? WHY!?


Wasted potential this season was...
Theo is gonna be the brother isn’t he
Im just ready to see Joe hunted down by FBI or something. I want to see outsmarted and watch this man be thrown in jail, brought to trial. I need him to have a worthy opponent who takes him down (and probably isn’t one of his obsessions)
so how the fuck did joe manage to get to paris after all that?? going through customs, being out in public with the massive news headlines of the homocide-murder btwn him and Love??
Loved the show. But, can't get out of my head how incompetent the police seems to be. They could have searched both the bakery and their house, a simple bluelight would have shown evidence of blood.
Joe + Marianne = 0 chemistry
Unpopular opinion, but >!The show should have ended with this season, with Love killing Joe. She's the only one who ever really understood 100% how his mind works and was able to stay one step ahead of him, and honestly, he's a sick fuck. His wife did everything for him, and yet he still kept looking at every other woman. He deserves to die!< Would have been a perfect ending, and honestly, I think having a fourth season will just be dragging the show on too long.
I think the show began to fall apart when Joe gave up and focused fully on Marienne . From that moment we were back to regular joe stuff which was incredibly disappointing to me after all the character development he had where he's literally trying so hard to be not his old self.

He's a bad person and needs to go to jail but him legitimately writing a letter to resign impressed me, he was totally ready to leave but Marianne forced it

Overall show was great and had a good conclusion but the Marianne thing was forced. A woman like that isn't trying to go after a married man regardless of if he says his marriage is over
i am really really really happy that henry ended up with dante. what a kind character and i really loved his actor.
I would seriously have watched series 4 if Love had killed Joe and became the narrator.

SPOILER WARNING:

Best season thus far, but the ending doesn't intrigue me. I'm not a fan of Marieanne as the next girl being chased, the time to bring her aboard doesn't work well... She's literally following up Love Quinn. There's no winning that.
I am half way through episode 9 and the personal emotional rollercoaster that this season is taking me on.. I don't really understand the need to kill the so early on. Because the only way it has effected the rest of the season is that the swinging couple overhear them. Otherwise, there was no building on the friendships Love made? I feel like time skipped and there was a missed opportunity for the root of the problems and issues they skipped over so much. I felt that a lot was missed. This season has thrown me? Not sure how I feel about it..
Whatever you think about the ending, Paris is the perfect setting for a creepy stalker serial killer romance.
>! If Joe was so prepared ahead of time to protect himself from (or kill) Love with wolfsbane, why did he grab the knife in the first place? Seems too convenient that he carries epinephrine (is there such thing as a pill form?), a syringe, and could've used that instead for protection (am I missing something). He also didn't know Love's deceased husband died via wolfsbane until Love came back from taking care of the baby so taking pills seems premature (Joe waited for Love to eat the chicken first so he knew the food wasn't poisoned). Idk, feel like the final clash had holes and it bothers me but know I could be missing something. Lol. !<
SPOILERS AS I’M ON MOBILE AND CAN’T COVER IT





Love and Joe as a killer couple was the best chemistry the show has ever had. My hopeful theory would be that Love doesn’t actually die, and used Candace’s body in place of hers for the fire. Remember the scene where they both wouldn’t tell each other where Candace’s body and Gil’s teeth were? And then Joe used the teeth to set up the scene in the end. Just hopeful wishing because I think Victoria Pedretti carried the season ☹️
I refuse to believe that... >!Love died!< at the end.
I would have rather followed Love in season 4 then see joe stalk for the fourth time in a row
OKAY BUT WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW EVERY TIME JOE TRIED TO “GET BETTER” LOVE JUST KEPT FUCKING THINGS UP AND KILLING PEOPLE. BY PATTERN OF WHAMMING THEM IN THE HEAD LIKE??  Also can we talk about how cute sherry & matthew were in the cage like mhm they shot eachother but they got closer in the end. Okay end of tangent. BUT LIKE SHE NEEDED TO BE STOPPED. JOE IS ALSO CRAZY AS SHIT BUT THIS SEASON HE VIRTUALLY DID NOTHING BESIDES HELPING COVER UP THE MURDERS AND KILLING MARIENNES EX. This season was an absolute shit show. Also the fact that hes in paris now this mf has went global-
UGH why couldn’t Love have made it! It felt too easy. And Matthew being suspicious of her just because of the bakery signing makes no sense. For me - Joe’s character is weakening and he’s preying on women way too quickly now with no depth. Love is more unpredictable and complex. Would have LOVED (lol) to see her for season 4 being the main character!!
please bring back Love, she was carrying this season smh
I think this season was the most entertaining to watch but man I hated the ending. Joe’s whole purpose in the beginning was to protect and care for Henry and what does he do? He kills the mother of his child and abandons him to go chase after some ass in Paris. Also, the whole season is about Marienne fighting for custody over her daughter why in the world would she want to be with a wife killer who abandoned his only child (and faked his own death, what’s his excuse going to be)? I highly doubt she would be cool with his serial killer tendencies. I’m sad for Love that Joe didn’t even mourn for her. He’s such a self-righteous narcissist I would be happy to see him go down in season 4. Really hoping Love didn’t die and will find him in Paris.
So Joe takes one look at Marianne and decides he likes (in love with) her. I’m not convinced. For some reason I just don’t feel like there was anything worthwhile there. His romantic interest in her felt very forced.
“Would you be a mistake” Yes Joe. Maybe he will realise love is the one at the end of the season
I thought this season was boring compared to the earlier seasons, but I loved the finale. Overall, I’m not a fan of the writing. It was blah and lazy. 

Anyway, I knew Love was eventually going to suffer the same fate as Joe’s previous obsessions, but Theo making it out alive was quite a surprise. I’m going to miss Victoria Pedretti - she’s an amazing actress and she plays crazy convincingly. Those crazy eyes… damn!

I also loved Sherry and Cary - they were hilarious. Sherry reminded me so much of Jen Shah from The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City - I was wondering the entire time if Sherry’s character was inspired by Jen Shah because the outfits, mannerisms, way of talking and the mean girl moves were just too similar lol.
this season felt like a parody of the show and the characters gave me whiplash lol
Hot take: I wished Joe died in the end, and the next season would focus on Love. I feel like we've gone as far as we can with Joe, but Love focusing on her son had a lot of potential
[deleted]
I wish they hadn't announced the renewal for S4 before S3 even premiered. I knew Joe had plot armor the whole time.
I would of much preferred this season had they made joe and love more of a killer couple that fell out but still managed to sort things in the end, I feel that them as a couple was better than either characters alone so the fact they really didn’t have them as much of a good couple annoyed me a bit.
Love that they brought James Scully back for a cameo. I was really missing Forty this season. Marienne is a good character, but not good enough to be excited that she’s his new obsession. I liked Love and was invested with her character. I also liked how unpredictable she was this season - definitely entertaining to watch. Wish they didn’t kill her off because I would have liked to see their dynamic further :/ now we’re back to single, baby-less Joe who is just stalking another prey. 🎶“I think I’ve seen this film before…”🎶

Loved the season, not a big fan of the ending.
A bit of an amusing fact I just discovered. Theo is supposed to be a 19 year old lusting after Love, a married woman in her mid 20s, when in reality the actor playing Theo is older than she is.
I really hope Season 4 is the end because seeing Joe getting away with shit again is irritating. I'm really glad that at least some people made it out alive but I knew there was no way both Joe and Love were both making it out by the end of the season. I expected Love to kill him though and season 4 to be from her perspective. I hope he gets a smarter opponent next season that is finally able to take him down
Major shout out to the music selection this season, Exile was amazing in the final episode, and I Lied by Lord Huron was really good too in an earlier episode
im actually obsessed with tati gabrielle. 
also sad that >!love got killed off bc even though they’re both murderers… love isn’t a stalker who steals lingerie from random women’s houses.!< so like, lesser of two evils ??
How did Theo spot Joe on the video footage at Natalie's car so quickly when Matthew has been viewing it for days and didn't spot anything? Isn't Matthew some genius
[deleted]
1. * joe: i will be a better person this time
1. * sees another attractive person
1. * Audience: Ahhh shit here we go again
I dont think im gonna watch s4 with enough eagerness.
For me Love was half of the show. Her murder scenes was so good that i was terrifying when i look at her eyes.
And joe fuck you man. You hippocrate. Youre a monster too. At least love knew that she was monster. She accepted herself and YOU.
I couldn't suspend my disbelief when I watched *Cary* running away from *Joe*, following them overhearing Love's confession. I mean, look at the sheer size and strength difference, Cary could have killed Joe with one punch but instead he runs away and **leaves his wife alone with two killers** in the room? How does that make any sense?
You could skip episodes 3-7, watch a 15 min recap and be good to go. Extremely strong start and end to the season with an extremely boring middle.
honestly disappointed that Love didn't kill Joe and become the new main character, Joe's shtick is getting old and repetitive, he was extremely unlikeable this season, his scenes with the librarian were boring af and i was just waiting for them to be over
HONESTLY - I would have preferred for Love to kill off everyone, including Joe, and escape to a new country and open a bakery in France while leaving Henry behind with someone trustworthy. I think i’m like Very tired of Joe and his shit. Making love the center of the show could have progressed it forward in a really smart way, forcing her to confront killing both of her ex husbands, forty dying, and leaving her child behind. She could have had a villanelle moment (but less assassin)
Did anyone else find it funny season 3 was in COVID era for like three episodes and then they just quit wearing masks for the rest?
“You murdered someone for another woman” was the best line of the series. What a strong reason to be jealous
am I the only one who found that adrenaline thing just to be some cheap plot armor in the last episode? like not only did he just so happen to know to grab the bottle but he magically knew to take it right before he grabbed the knife? 

and if he wasn't really paralyzed, why wouldn't he just get up and run away at any point? like, he literally had a plan to escape with Marienne so why not just go do that if he wasn't really paralyzed.
Yeah, almost wish this show wasn't so successful and was more on the level of Netflix's usual three seasons and done model. Like we could have had a real climactic showdown between Joe and Love, but the show's massive success means they'll have to stretch this out for another two or three seasons.

There's really zero appeal to see Joe go to another city and stalk another woman. This season the stalking was already starting to feel repetitive and that's with the added drama of Henry and Love as Joe's equal. Now, going back to season 1's formula as Joe as a single guy obsessed with another woman is going to feel like such a come-down.
Tbh it's just bad,they ruined the whole premise of the first season.. s2 was ok, but this one is nonsense, there's just no enough consequences to their actions... Just like killing eve turning into a comedy show.. why the writing quality decreases so much after first season? we need phoebe waller-bridge to come and save us all
Started hoping at the end that Love would kill Joe and season 4 would follow her. I just feel like that would have been more interesting than Joe going international searching for someone who he had no chemistry with.
Just finished it and i kinda love it but dislike the pacing sometimes. The first 4 episodes felt very fast for me because something is always going on. The later episodes, there were definitely some pacing issues but it is not to a point I mind as much.

Is it just me who kinda hated the editing? I feel like there was too much contrast on the background and the person in focus. That always distracted me throughout the entire series.

But overall, I actually really love the relationship between Joe and Love. I love that they are so similar ie. they both hv abandonment issues and both are obviously killers. Despite that, they are different like their killing methods where Joe is more of a planned murderer but Love is more of an unhinged/impulsive killer. I actually really love that they know each other so well to the point that they know and predict what the other will do. It feels like they are in the same team but at the same time, still in a cat and mouse situation together. 

Sad that Love is not going into season 4 because I truly did like their dynamic together even despite all the flaws and cheating they both did. Was it toxic? Definitely. But was it boring? Hell nah. Does teamwork make the dreamwork? Maybe. 

Overall: 8.3/10
Oh my god I just finished this season in under 24hrs! Definitely a whirlwind of emotions I am feeling right now!

Personally I LOVED the dynamic between Joe and Love working together and being partners in crime. It was really exciting and I’m so happy the milfy neighbour died off so quick because she seemed boring. 

Honestly, no one will ever compare to Love (is it Victoria’s acting??? idk) so I don’t really know if I want to watch season 4 at all! I was hoping this would be the last season. Despite Love getting killed off, the other characters got closure and it showed Joe moving to another city and just never changing. He will always fall back into his cycles. It seemed like an okay ending. I got so annoyed when I saw that season 4 was already confirmed 

Tbh I just wanted Joe to love Love and stop being obsessed with Marienne. I wanted to see more of Joe and Love’s dynamic of insanity and them against the world. They are so similar but so different. Their family backgrounds are so different but fucked them up nonetheless. I love the contrast between Love’s impulsivity and Joe’s calculative and obsessive plans. And how they are doing all the killings in the name of love.  We know Joe is a narcissist but what is Love? I also loved the therapy scenes, and just the “we need couples therapy” line. Absolutely lost it at that one. Imagine the therapist finding out about Love and Joe on the news LMAOOO

I LOVED Sherry and Cary’s storyline especially towards the end. They really saved the ending and I would read their entire book if I could 😭
It’s almost time
I did enjoy the dark humor and exaggeration of life in the suburbs. There are alot of married suburban couples who are playing house and don’t really like each other and it was interesting to see a caricature of that and what is often the facade of suburban life. It’s a sad reality
I actually got tired of following Joe. He is basically irredeemable at this point. I wish instead we got an alternate ending where Love comes out alive and we follow her in next season. Put Joe's story to rest.
Honestly, throughout the entire series, I've wanted Joe to win. But after he >!killed love!< I want this MF dead. Love is seriously my favourite part of the show, similar to the way Amy from Gone Girl is likeable as a character, but also psycho. I'm so pissed with how this season ended. Joe's story is getting old and >!without Love to be apart of the storyline!< I find season 4 is going to be repetitive.
I think the season 4 plot would be better if Love killed Joe instead and the next story would be she as a protagonist living a new life. It would be cool because would kinda be like season 2 but in Loves perspective 

At this point Joe alone is so boring to watch and the new girl is even more… I have no idea how the writers will make it interesting and also because of the language issues as hes in Paris now lmao
Well, they've been trying for 3 seasons so far and I hated that I couldn't do it, BUT THEY FINALLY SUCCEEDED. 

&#x200B;

I fucking hate Joe Goldberg. I want to watch him burn in season 4. 

&#x200B;

"More famous than Guinevere Beck". I. SCREAMED and felt red hot rage flow through me I swear...
what ive got from this season is that Love was just a crazy person while Joe is an autentic psycopath. Love mostly doesn't analyze the consequences of her acts and tends to regret, she gets really nervous after killing and doesnt know how to react or what to do. In the other hand, Joe is colder, analyses everything, always get away with every murder whitnout been discovered by himself.
What Season 3 was missing was the slow burn that Season 1 especially had, and that was still present in Season 2. In the first two seasons there was a buildup, a progression of carefully-intertwined events that led to the big moments. But with Season 3, it was like a slew of big moments, with no buildup leading to it. They just jumped right in, and didn’t stop for the entire 10 episodes. 

This didn’t fit the pace or style of the past two seasons, and it didn’t fit who we knew Joe (or Love, for that matter) to be. We knew Joe as pensive, deliberating, thoughtful (in his way), careful (also in his way, not making excuses for him here). Season 3 didn’t match that. 

I think they should’ve cut the number of characters in half, and done slower, more in-depth story lines with more substance, to give the audience time to really become invested. Seasons 1 and 2 had more substance and felt more “real” to me. Season 3 felt fake and fast. And I agree with others who have said that it felt “soapy”.  I hope they get back to the old, slower, more personal pace in Season 4.
I honestly find the whole “Joe truly wants to be a better man” thing puzzling. Or rather, it’s not as simple as it seems. I think that in Joe’s ideal world, he wouldn’t have to kill anyone - that’s about as far as it gets. I’m sure the same could be said for Love, because like Joe, she works to justify her murders. I don’t think either of them are better or worse people, she’s more impulsive and he’s more calculating but they’re both ruthless murderers.

Regardless of how many times Joe said “I’m not that guy I don’t want to be that guy” he sure found it super easy to murder Marienne’s ex in a very personal way. He is always gonna be that guy, and I hope that by the end of his arc he’s accepted that it’s just who he is.
Also Cary is peak himbo and I’m so here for it
I was really hoping that >!Love would succeed in killing Joe and then the series would just follow Love. It would have kept things fresh rather than repeating the same things over and over again. Also, as far as I know, no other series has ever done that before. Love is a lot more likeable, Joe’s pattern is getting old quick. Also, it winds me up that Joe refused to see that Love does things for the exact same reason he does. If he sees what he’s doing as noble, why does he see her doing it as crazy and dangerous? So yeah, I think that either Season 3’s finale should have been the absolute end (because it wraps it up so well) or that Love should have been the one to continue, not Joe.!<
Joe has arrived in Paris. Please kill Emily next, we need her gone.
Dante was my favorite character this season
So, if Joe wasn’t actually paralyzed, why would he let Love lure Marienne into the house knowing what her intention was?
Will we ever see all the survivors again from previous seasons and this one? Paco, Ellie, Theo, etc? It just seems right that that would happen, right???
I think this was my favorite season, though it’s hard to compare to the novelty of the first one. It took a minute to get there, but I feel like the show is at its best when it just goes for it and goes completely off the rails. It kind of has to at this point now that the body counts are so high. I loved the suburbia setting, seeing Love go full batshit, and loled at Joe deluding himself into thinking he’s stable/responsible. 

I didn’t love the Marianne plot, but I’m hopeful that if she returns in season 4 it won’t be in a relationship with Joe. Maybe she’ll be suspicious about Loves parting message to her and try to investigate? I feel like the show knows it can’t just repeat a joe stalks a girl storyline at this point after upping the ante. The Natalie plot line this season also gives me faith that they won’t repeat the same thing, it seemed like she’d be a familiar season-long character and then things took a total left turn.
Who else is still sad af that love isn’t going to be in season 4! She was awesome!!!!!!!!!! Amazing actor! The best show I have ever seen
Unpopular opinion : I love this season ! Nearly as much as season 2 but way much than season 1.
Victoria Pedretti is a 💎 of an actress and she will be missed if Love is truly....
I'm sure this isn't as unpopular an opinion as I feel it is, but I almost wish another season wasn't announced. S3 would have been a decent spot to leave it off. I just feel like there's only so many times you can do the "Joe falls for another woman and self-sabotages his life". Yeah, there are still different resolutions that we can come to on it but having him meet his match in Love and have to outwit her would have made a great finale for the series, maybe have it end differently than the way it did (maybe with him and Love killing each *other*). 

I just don't know how they're gonna pull off another season of this same song and dance. They're really gonna have to change up the formula for S4 so it doesn't just feel like Joe making dumb decisions over and over and over again. I get that that's the fun of it, the whole *point* is that Joe is a psychotic idiot, but even throughout S3 it felt so *exhausting* at times lol
Fuck man Joe and Love were supposed to succeed
uhhhh I do not want to see another season of joe following women around in a baseball cap
Season 4 could be pretty hype if it turns out Love had the exact same thinking about Adrenaline and somehow escaped. Might be a bit of plot armour but it would be pretty cool for her to be the main character stalking down Joe. Would be a good ending to the show as well
I would really like season 4 to be the last. I feel like this model isn't sustainable. Bring back the pee jar and throw his ass in prison!
Marianne and everything surrounding her was boring af, just a pretty face. They gave her 0 fun or interesting qualities. Natalie was insipid as hell and also never said a single interesting thing.
It’s crazy how romanticized this series is that we forget they’re serial killers 💀
Matthew does not give a damn to his wife when she is alive, but is all geared up with his tech to find the murderer ~ ironical
I guess I'm going to have to be the one to say it... 

Season 3 was an absolute dumpster fire. I think I'm done with this show.
 I was definitely thoroughly entertained this season but disappointed with the ending and that there will be a season 4. 

>!I was soooo excited when Love went in for the kill with Joe, but disappointed he ended up living lol.  I thought it would have been fitting for him to die like that. Like others have said Joe repeating the same routine every season has gotten monotonous so I thought it would have been interesting for Love to take over as protoganist. Also I laughed my ass at off at Matthew leaving him there!< 

Honestly I liked Love a lot this season; I liked how she was a mirror to Joe and kinda gave him a taste of his own medicine. 

Also I kept wondering the whole time why Matthew was only looking at those few seconds over and over again.. he obviously didn't believe Gil was the murderer so why didn't he track his movements? He would have seen him walk into the bakery and never come out. 

Not really to excited to see Joe sneak around with his baseball cap just in France this time, but I know I'll be watching it when it comes out. 😪
I love/hate season 3! But it definitely stood out compared to the first two for me. Also I know they're both crazy but I started hating Joe more when his focus turned to Merienne more than trying for his family. Like Love became an "outsider" (lack of a better word) when Merienne became his "You" and the focus of his inner monologue. Hated it. All the more when he killed Love and felt absolutely no remorse or didn't even look slightly sad that he killed his wife after being a "team". I mean I felt like he was really planning to get rid of her even before he knew that Love found out about Merienne. He just went back to his old ways and that camp did not help! Haha

Also not to ever tolerate cheating but I felt like Love's cheating was out of frustration and sadness that Joe could never see her the way he did in S2 + all the other stuff like grieving and postpartum. Meanwhile Joe's was because he was going back to his old ways. Really thought character development was gonna happen for him (them). AND!!! Playing Exile at the end really took me out (I love Taytay)!!!

Sorry my thoughts are still so scattered still processing and having so many emotions after watching it lol
Imo, this was the weakest season by far.

It starts on strong, in that I didn't like it, but I trusted the writing team like in the past, and boy oh boy was I rewarded, when they got through the therapy episode and Love and Joe teamed up.  But after that everything went downhill.

I think a better second half of the season would have been Joe and Love getting some comeuppance, Mathew finding out diffintively what they were but NOT going to the police.  Becuase he wants to deal with them himself.

Then a cat and mouse game where they are the victims being hunted, all the while set against a suburban background where they have to play nice and notmal in social settings while being terrified during the private moments, while Mathew takes them down one step at a time.  Mathew would have made for an incredible villain, but still be sympathetic.  We could have explored lore of the characters.  And if they wanted to grow, great.  If the writers wanted them to not grow, but instead prove they are incapable of truly changing even better.  Culminately in an ending where either Love dies or Henry is taken away and Joe is left alone again.  

With an overall moral for the season being that you can't outrun your past, you havr to face it and learn from it. Accept consequences and stop making the same mistakes.  It would have been satisfying whether Joe learned these lessons or not.

Instead we got a bunch of shit.  And whats worse, the bones for an incredible season are right there.  What a waste.
Well, considering there are 3000+ comments on this post (as of 11.03.21) I don't think i am going to add anything revolutionary, just my personal intake.

I really liked this season I think it was good, my only complaint is that the pacing seemed off some moment I felt like so much was happening and everything was packed in  a few episodes while other moments I could barely pay attention, the first part and last episodes are great  I completely stay on that but the middle meh. Boring and felt like filler. Killing Love was predictable af but still made me a bit upset cause it meant going back to the old formula. 

I also pray, hope, the 4th season  is the final season. I am afraid anymore, and we'll be going in circles so if they can just end on a good season it would be remembered as a good show, not great by any means but good enough to be rewatched and rediscovered some years down the line
Does anyone know why Joe kept Theo alive at the end…?
The show does an incredible job of portraying Joe's image of himself as the only "real" person, above all the modern societal bullshit - when he is literally the fakest and worst person there. 

Flip to Cary and Sherry, the "fake" couple representing all the modern stereotypes you love to hate. Turns out, they're pretty real after all, and are a fucking POWER couple.

My main complaint is they really missed an opportunity to cleanly wrap up Joe's story. Joe could finally realize he's an evil person and (even worse) completely full of shit, and that Love really is his perfect (psychopathic) match.
I really liked the dialogue between >!Love!< and >!Marienne !<at the end.>! Two different women who suffered trauma in their lives yet ended up in two different paths; one just much brighter than the other. As terrible as Love can be (and she made me SO mad throughout S3 with her reckless murder sprees), I truly believe Joe just made her worse. If Love is bad, Joe is 100X worse. It makes me wonder why she said they were perfect for each other in the end and I think it was because they are both hurt from the neglect they experienced in their childhoods. But going off on a tangent here. !<Overall, the dialogue spoke to me because it seemed like>!Love needed someone to tell her those empowering words from the start. And to help instill it into her as a young child, before she became so bad. It's also a wise message about women having each other's backs, the importance of self-love and having a healthy relationship with yourself first so you don't fall even further by letting in the wrong people.!<

>!"You know when you have that tiny voice inside your head, even for a fleeting moment, that tells you 'You deserve better…'? That’s your partner. That’s your real, true love. And if you betray her long enough you will lose her." Marienne's !<lines went something like this.
Just finished S3 and it was really good. 

I really don't understand people saying that framing Love wasn't good because at the end of the day, it was all true? I want Joe to stop getting away with everything so easily, but S3 was 90% of Joe dealing with Love's impulsive mistakes. >!Some people say that Joe made her become worst, but she already had a pattern too. First with her brother's situation and then with her ex husband (also she was already planning to do it again with Joe from the moment she started growing that plant on her backyard). She blamed it all on Joe's obsessions but her behavior was also a consequence of her own obsession.!< She would've done anything to make things go as she wanted to. They were equally bad.
Currently on episode 5 and have been growing to dislike Love since the 1st, this episode just sealed it 🙃

I liked it. I do wish it had been a bit less similar to the last two seasons. They could definitely still have highlighted Joe’s pattern while mixing it up a bit.

It would have been fun if they had done a sort of “Gone Girl” situation with Natalie. Bored housewife, who tries to have an affair with the boring neighbour. Maybe Natalie somehow realises they’re crazy (she escapes when Love tries to kill her, or finds Joe’s box) and uses that as a way to frame them for her death and run off. Joe and Love have to work together to get out of the situation and killing probably ensues.

I just think Natalie was such a fun character, it would’ve been great to use her more. Plus it would’ve given more of the Love and Joe team dynamic that I personally felt was the best part of this season.
Just finished episode 1 holy shit. I love love so much and didn’t see that ending coming lmao
I can't help but think they should've ended this show this season. I really can't think of a more compelling character/ foil for Joe than Love :-/
Probably should’ve let Love live if they wanted to continue an interesting season 4. Joe stalking and killing people isn’t going to do it anymore, and what is there really without Love? Only thing I can think of is that they fast forward 20 years and Joe is stalking his own kid, making sure he won’t turn out as Joe did. Maybe tries to guide Henry away from all the evil cravings.
any  animal kingdom fans excited to see scott Speedman(Baz) in this

So I guess Joe's next victim is gonna be.... [Emily](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EIP_101_Unit_00278R-e1624446929424.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1)???

Kidding aside that would make a very dope albeit confusing crossover.
Can someone explain to me how Theo found a camera angle that Matthew didn’t? Matthew saw the car leaving the alleyway, if the other footage was so easily accessible that Theo could access it, why didn’t Matthew?
Does anyone think they’ll rewatch? I loved rewatching season one and two but two because i loved Love’s character. But with season 3 i honestly cannot see myself rewatching it. Maybe im not understanding the full character development everyone is talking about but it was just so chaotic (joes fixations, killings)
My favorite part of the whole season was the scene when exile is playing it gave me chills. But besides that it just was meh. Can anyone relate?
I have to agree with other comments that this season was underwhelming. I feel as if it started off stronger than it ended. 

Anyway, Joe and Love were more unlikeable than ever before. They introduced an interesting character in Natalie just to kill her off and for Joe to become obsessed with someone less interesting (also someone whose character parallels Beck. Been there, done that. But maybe that’s the point lol). Some moments were certainly cringey and I wish they had done without. Worst of all, they killed off Love. Which I don’t have an issue with in itself, but I feel as if it could have been done better, and served their relationship the justice it deserved. It would have been far more interesting for their battle to have stretched out over a few episodes, with masterminded games and attempts to kill each other. 

I can’t believe they’ve regressed back to season 1 Joe, it just feels like such a waste. I don’t know where the story will go from here. I think the only thing they could do is have Joe’s actions finally catch up to him.
Wow. Binged this season in an entire day (thank you Netflix for being add-free). A LOT of thoughts to unpack, but I am going ~~to~~ try to keep it short and sweet because I am running solely on adrenaline and want to give my eyes a rest. These are just a few of my thoughts and if you disagree that is totally okay, I'm sure we all have different interpretations/takeaways.

I am really conflicted on the season as a whole, and that is mainly due to the ending. For the record, I have always rooted for the females on this show, starting all the way back with Beck. Of course she wasn't the most polished character, and lord knows she had her flaws, but I absolutely hated that she was killed off (though I may be alone in feeling that way). For me, this finale was ptsd all over again.

I understand that Joe is the protagonist, and therefore it is very unlikely that he will ever meet his demise, unless the show is ending. However, I was disappointed with the direction they took regarding >!Love's death, though I can admit the ending was fitting for a finale.!< I still feel as though there was more to come from this character, and perhaps that is because Victoria is just a phenomenal actress and I am always impressed by her. I just think she brought something different to this show. I see a lot of comments where people are saying they feel that she had some very fast and unnatural character development going from the second to third season, and I have to agree. Some things certainly felt rushed. She may have done a lot of f'ed up things this season, but there was no denying she was a good mother to Henry. I'm not sure what the writers wanted us to feel for the character, but even in the end I was rooting for her. The last person I wanted to see come out of this was Joe (er-Nick?). In fact, I think this season made me strongly dislike him to the point of not wanting to see him get a happy ending, ever. Because he will *never* be satisfied. This pattern is only going to continue. If you ask me, he is becoming aggressively worse and each time he tries to justify what he's doing, it sounds more and more desperate. I can't believe I used to justify his actions in earlier seasons!

Onto Henry, what an upsetting and short lived plot.>! I'm sure if the two of them remained as parents Henry would still have had a pretty screwed up childhood, but I think leaving him an "orphan" was pretty sh\*tty. !<The poor kid is going to consistently have to dodge the shadow of his parents. >!Dante adopting !<was the best solution though, so I was relieved by that.

Shout out to Cary and Sherry who, as many have mentioned in the comments, turned out to be really likable supporting characters who really made this season worth watching. I also enjoyed the subtle messages that were slipped in, such as anti-vaxxer discussions and providing some insight on "white woman syndrome." Dottie ordering tacos also killed me.

Overall, I am too invested to not continue onto the fourth season, as frustrated as I may get. >!Marienne is too good for Joe, and her ass better not be in Paris.!< As for the direction of the show itself, I'm not really interested in seeing another woman fall in love with, and then proceed to be killed by Joe. Maybe they'll surprise us with a completely different storyline next season. Either way, the FBI really needs to get on this- and I mean the real FBI, because Matthew and these PI's were not very good sleuths (though it was lovely seeing Marcia Cross on my screen again).
I can believe >! It toook 5 second to Theo to figure out what to look in the camera while the dad who is suppose to be a tech genius was just watching the same irrelevant one!<
Am I the only one a bit annoyed at the lack of accountability that seems to bless Joe? I just think that after 3 seasons, there needs to be some kind of legal/official implication from what he has done over years. I understand that a theme of the show is him getting away with his crimes but it’s getting irritating now (and making it all seem superfluous)
I think this season really highlighted that Joe can never really be happy.  Once the pursuit is over and he really gets to know someone, he’s done.  Love knew who he really was and loved him back and it still wasn’t enough.  It also shows how delusional Joe is.  He thought Love was a monster even though she did exactly the same things he did.  Wild.  I have no idea what they’re going to do for season 4, but I hope it’s not just following another random poor woman around.
Just finished episode 3 so not even gonna look at the comments, but god damn did I feel creepy for having the fattest crush on Theo. Then felt better after looking him up and seeing he’s only TWO years younger than me 😅
Joe looks the exact same in season 4?? Just two toes less and a different name?? What if someone he knew when he lived as Joe meets him at Paris and recognizes that he has two toes less?? which was also the only confirmed evidence found at the finale crime scene..?
Season was overall alright. Nothing great, but decent enough.

I think they really butchered some characters and storylines, I actually chuckled a few times at how bat shit insane they made Love, who was just a loose canon all season. Every single time someone turned their back she whacked them in the head with something, and she just had so many head scratching stupid moves throughout the season, it just seemed off from S2 Love. Speaking of S2 Love-- where were her "friends" who were a decently big part of her story in S2? Not even mentioned?

Joe's delusion that Love was the issue and not him was funny as well, albeit, intentionally I believe. 

Wasn't a fan of the young Joe storyline. Felt like it dragged on a bit too long and got some serious "The Butterfly Effect" vibes when his young self was telling the nurse about the signs of an abusive relationship and getting out of it. Just seemed way above a childs paygrade and reminded me of *The Butterfly Effect* when he goes back in time and tells off his friends father as a child.

Joe's ability to be a chameleon and stalk people seemed to get a huge nerf this season. As it probably should've from the start seeing as his disguise is literally a hat, but I would've preferred a bit more consistency on that front.

Overall, it wasn't bad. I'll watch S4, but there was just as big of a drop off this season as there was from S1 to S2.
I really liked the season when it was about a suburban family of murderers trying to act normal/cover their tracks. For example, Episode 2 was by far my favorite.

But then it got stale… like REALLY stale.

They had a really hard time balancing old trends (like Joe obsessing over someone) and new ones (like Love being absolutely insane), and it made the second half of the season a big slog.

To sum it up: the highs are super high, the lows are super low. Ultimately enjoyed it more than I didn’t.
I honestly was hoping Joe would die and the show would continue with Love. She was such a good addition. I would have loved to see her more.
I’m in love with Love this season. And I don’t know why, and I’m a little concerned about it. But her raw passion is so appealing to see on screen.
hey i trapped theo in the basement let’s have a baby ?????
I really hope marriene doesn't appear in s4. She just doesn't live up to the standards of the previous women Joe has been obsessed with, not believeable.
After how disappointed leave me Candace's ending last season, I was waiting for her to appears as one of Joe's classic visions to torturing him about how murder will always follow him and reminds him that he isn't a good person. 

Also, now with >!Love's death!< will we ever find out what happened with >!Candace's and Delilah's bodies?!<

Also I like the scene between Love and Forty; I already read that some people find it weird, but as a fraternal twin myself, it was very sad and I could related with the concept of your twin being your soulmate; I'm glad the season didn't brush over about how much Love missed him. Also, Forty was adorable in the bathtub scene.

I would've love for the dynamic of the murder couple to continue at least for another season so we could have see how it really affect Henry, but the baby plot  and Joe trying to find peace with fatherhood felt wasted.

Still this was by far my favorite season and Love Quinn was the star, I'm excited to see what's more is for Joe in Paris.
[deleted]
honestly wat a sick sick show
Sorry but I’m just not interested in this show anymore. I got so bored when Joe got his new obsession with the librarian, and now that love is gone looks like we’re back to square one. 

The season started of strong but had to force myself through the last 4 or so episodes. 

Not really interested in this show anymore without the Joe/Love dynamic. Or maybe I just have too much of a girl crush on Victoria Pedretti lol
[deleted]
Worst season yet. 
Joe character was butchered, he did not evolve, he refused Love for no reason, has 0 chemistry or reason for Marianne to fall in love with...

Worst season ending..

First 2 seasons are great, never watch s3 .stupid revolting ending
Entertaining season but it really bothered me how much Love was gaslit. Joe, never was good or valiant, but this was … awful. What a total asshole…
I know that Joe is supposed to be a psychopath, but he does show some glimpses of humanity in his flashbacks and monologues about “not being that person anymore”. That being said, he has been through so many cycles of loving someone and having them killed. Is that not mentally draining an traumatizing? How does he have the energy to go to Paris and do it all again? This season I had hoped that we would see him become haunted by Beck, Candace, and everyone else he has killed or lost along the way. He spent a long time with some of these people, shared moments with them, had the feel good chemicals simmer, and ultimately had it all ripped away cyclically. This season we got the usual Joe antics with some more mother and urgency to protect issues, but I don’t think it added much that we didn’t already know. 


He is a flawed character and I can see why they wrote him the way they did this season. If they go down the route in which his continual agency to kill is his downfall then I won’t be mad. But what I would like to see is some exposition about something that goes beyond him being a monster. What is the main message of this series?
Burning questions about final episode....

1. >!Surely Joe's toes would be burnt up in the fire and wouldn't leave any DNA being such a small part of his body? Or is that box they were in meant to be fire-proof!<
2. >!Why did he put a toe in the pie? Again, it would be incinerated.!<
3. >!Why the hell hasn't Joe been caught yet?! I know it is TV but he stabbed Ryan to death outside a busy gym, following fighting with him in the carpark. There would be camera's everywhere, his face is uncovered and he's not wearing gloves...!<
I found myself rooting for Joe for the first half of this season, but the second half made him more and more unredeemable, until the very end. Joe is an asshole, a hypocrite and he thinks he's the greatest person in the world.

It was really cool when Love literally started talking to paralysed Joe exactly as he would've talked to one of his obsessions, and Joe hated her for it. Joe loves himself, and Joe hates himself, which is what makes him such an interesting character.

The end of the show was kinda sad, I was really hoping this couple would work out, but I guess not. F.

I definitely liked the first half more, in hindsight. Where Joe and Love were like partners in crime, going to couples therapy, raising their kid, running their business and juggling it with changing diapers. The second half seemed much faster-paced and crazier with Joe reverting to old patterns, but I guess they had to do that if they wanted to keep the show going (which I'm not sure they should, Marianne is REALLY boring).
Anyone else feel like writers missed a big opportunity in season 3? I really enjoyed the first half but the second half became boring and flat. It would’ve been much more interesting to see Love and Joe still completely in love in season 3 and trying to be better people, but, as their past chases them and as they find new obstacles, they have to resort to old ways. It just seems like a more entertaining plot, like a Santa Clarita Diet , Gomez and Morticia Addams, or Mr and Mrs Smith. More chaos and fun. Instead, we got Joe’s same old shenanigans and jealousy. Not only one, but two new obsessions that felt like they utterly lacked chemistry. And Joe, once again, getting away with his crimes. If Love really is gone for good, it almost seems like two seasons of character development have gone down the drain. Not to mention losing such a stellar actress. Love really elevated S2 and S3. And after all the flashbacks to his years in the orphanage, it seems laughable that the ending means they parted ways with Henry. He has been abandoned, too (although probably now in better hands).

Side note, did anyone feel like the filters made the show blurry at times? They sometimes used too strong of a gradient on the outside edges that made me question my eyesight.
The forced political commentary of this season is off putting. Stick to what you are good at please
Marianne sounds like a phone sex operator. She is talks like she’s trying to seduce someone 24/7. It really bothers me now lmao
I wish I enjoyed Marianne’s character more. I felt like she was very stiff and unlikeable.
Insane that they villainized Love this season. There were several redeeming characteristics in season 2, and by the end of season 3, they make it seem like all their problems are because of Love. Like, no, Joe - you're the biggest problem. I can't wait for them to kill off Joe.
I fucking hate Joe Goldberg man. 

Love was perfect for him, and his dumb hypocritical ass should have appreciated her. 

Like murder is never justifiable, and they're both absolute garbage people, but they both followed the same train of thought and logic. Killing to protect the people they care about. Joe's dumb ass couldn't tolerate that for some reason, and fucked his own life up. 

I hope he never finds M, and if he does, I know for a fact he is going to get obsessed with some new girl and get M killed too.
did anyone else find it sad when joe had to kill love? that shit is straight up getting to me
Edit: don't read unless you've finished S3. *Spoilers*

IMO Love's erratic behavior for S3 can easily be explained by a) witnessing Forty get killed/mourning his death, b) knowing in the back of her mind that Joe only married her because she was prego, and c) possible postpartum issues. Not to mention moving to a completely new area and trying to set roots is overwhelming too. I mean think about it, if she was already batshit crazy to begin with, these additional stressors probs just sent her over the edge.

The bathtub scene with Love and Forty made me wonder if the show was literally hinting at past incest? Kinda seems to fit when you consider Love killed the sitter. Maybe it wasn't as much about protecting Forty as it was eliminating the "competition"? I think it could also kinda explain her unhealthy attachments to partners.

I'm so lost as to why they're continuing this series lol. To me the only thing they could do to make it halfway decent is if Joe finally gets caught. Maybe he meets another cunning "Natalie" who actually turns out to be an FBI agent or something? Or Love isn't really dead so she pulls a "Joe" and starts searching for Marienne, knowing it will lead her to Joe. Orrr maybe the Salingers PI found him in Madre Linda and was able to follow him to Paris? Whatever route they take, it has to be executed flawlessly in order to keep the essence of the show positive.
This might be screaming into the void at this point since it's been a month since this season has come out but one point I did want to make:

There is a **ton** of suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this show, but outside of that, the writers truly do a great job of working through such a unique plot. The biggest difficulty with a show like this is the escalation - after season 1, you're left wondering how the hell Joe is going to keep doing this without having it catch up to him, while also writing interesting and more engaging stuff for the audience. They did that with season 2 and added an interesting new element. This new element (wife and kid) really, really wrote them into a corner and they spent season 3 working with it anyway as best they could while **further** escalating the wild plot with all these new variables, and then wrote themselves out of the corner by the end of the season, such they have the same "base" they had when the show started: Single Joe, no kid to deal with on screen, no wife, all dealt with in the plot. That's why I have confidence in the writers moving ahead to season 4 - people keep asking if it'll get stale and if Joe will just re-do what he did season 1, but I'm confident the writers, with the same base coming into the show and going into season 2, will prove they have some new unique direction for the show.

I don't think I'm the target demographic for a show like this (30-year-old male, likes sci-fi and action) but the totality of what it offers - unique plot, humorous social commentary, funny one-liners in a voiceover, more - really makes for a fun ride.
Feel like this show needs to end with the next season or its going to go down hill fast. Also police really need to start being a thing in the next season. Joe gets away with everything so perfectly every season.
Okay after finishing season 3 and you see the end of Love and Joe go back and watch season 2 and look at their love story it is so heartbreaking. Joe destroyed Love and turned her into what she became in season 3.
Seriously I finished season three and they went back and rewatch season 2 and I cried certain places about how much they loved each other
Watching episode 1 of S3 now.  I would be devastated if Love Quinn dies :(
How old is Theo? It’s weird that Love, maybe 35ish, is having sex with a teenager,18-19. It’s so uncomfortable to watch them being intimate. If the genders were switched I think it would not be ok, but this ?
Kinda of a bummer ending tbh >!Love dying really sucked. I genuinely feel like she was the best fit for Joe and enjoyed the Bonnie and Clyde aspect of it. Not really super intrigued with where the next season set up is headed. Unfortunately. The first couple episodes were spectacular though, I feel like they could have played more with Joe and Love before having her die in a really… anticlimactic way. Or was that just me? Also the swinging aspect was… interesting… to say the least. I wasnt a “fan of Love” because obviously, she’s a fucking murderer, but Joe and her are two sides to the same coin and they had the same deep seated needs. He also wasn’t even remotely sad. I get she came after him first in a way but it was depressing that he wasn’t even a little anguished. He looked more sad killing Beck than the mother of his child yikes. I guess his character is a lot more shallow than I thought!<
Kinda frustrating to see one of Love’s last few moments was picking names for their future daughter while Joe busy swinging his dick outside.
Does anyone feel love gaslight joe in this season.
I know it’s very unlikely but I’m still hoping love somehow made it out☠️
I love in the swing and a miss episode, the safe word is Hakuna Matata, and Joe’s inner monologue is: “Disney should sue these people.” I fucking died at this line
What time are they adding it
umpopular opinion but they were all ANNOYING this season
Man the pacing this season was absolutely wack. A good middle portion of the season, I felt like nothing happened. Season 2 is still my favorite. This season felt more like a drama then a thriller. Hopefully the next season gets back to the S1 S2 feeling.
I found season 3 to be hectic and like the overall plot was hard to see until the end. Its almost a miracle that there was an overall plot with all the different directions it took. However I see the most defining elements being Love's struggle to maintain her current life against her connection to fourty and how badly Joe wanted to protect Henry from repeating the past.

Despite everyone hating Theo for messing in a marriage, it could not be more clear that he represented fourty. As much as Love wanted to protect her existing family, it felt good again to have a reckless, young, stupid boy need her emotionally and cause damage to her life. It was like a drug to Love and despite how much she told him to stop, she couldn't cut it off for good. When Love finally deleted Fourty's phone number from her phone, it was no coincidence that Theo turned up a second later. Of course Theo was the innocent victim in this because he was so naive and easy to manipulate he couldn't see her for what she truly was. After clear debate, Love picked her immediate family survival over fourty replacement and cracked Theos head. The only thing that kept him alive was Joe who still has somewhat of a moral code to keep innocent people alive. 

I didn't see Joe giving up Henry but after all the cutscenes going back to his childhood and fear of abandonment identified in therapy, combined with all his attempts and subsequent failings to maintain a normal life, it makes sense why he gave up Henry.
Who knew such shady shit was going down at Luke's Diner.  Paris was right.
If love had tried to kill Joe after episode 1, I'd be more onboard with it. But she was too reckless with her murders
So mega MEGA MEGA SPOILER so stop reading if you haven't finished the show!

If joe is supposably >dead< then how the heck could he get to >France< ????
OMG YES! the scene where joe and love attack/try and kill the obnoxious ig influencer and her weirdo husband.  i was like GETTEM 👏👏 cause up until then it was predictable af and i hated everyone..
new to the fanbase so this might be unpopular, but i really did not like theo. i hated him every time he was on screen. like yeah i get the point of his character but honestly i did not enjoy his arc with love and him as a character one bit
I’m sad that Taylor swift and bon iver song was perfect . I litteraly want to run threw a wall right now that ending was almost perfect . Victoria Pedretti is a godess.
Next season in Paris let’s go. I wonder what can happen next though.
This was THE B E S T season.
i’m really bummed that he killed love. she got on my nerves but i still loved her character. or maybe i just love the actress 😝
> now that Love is dead, who is going to compare? the show will go downjill from here, she was by far the most interesting girl Joe has been obsessed with <
Anyone else find it fascinating that this season >!Natalie was murdered!< and there’s a whole
Episode dedicated to missing white woman syndrome and a search takes place in a state park, while that is a huge story irl right now with the gabby petito case?
I don't understand why people are so annoyed by Joe going to stalk yet another woman... Like, that's exactly what stalkers/serial killers do, I think that they have explained his psyche perfectly in this show through his actions, I hope the next season is the last one where he gets caught and goes to jail!
[deleted]
I know so many people are sad to see Love go, but in my honest opinion it was just well-deserved. Even though Joe killed Ryan, he was trying to be a better person for Henry. Love on the other hand didn’t really look like she was trying and instead was just okay still being the serial killer she was, even with Henry. Don’t get me wrong, I still think both of them deserve to die, but Love more because Joe was at least trying… Not to mention that Love tried to kill him first. I thought the actonite syringe was genius!
All I gotta say is I'm so happy Matthew and Theo made it out alive
Joe is going to run out of phalanges if this show goes much longer
Maybe Tati carried some of Prudence's mischievous attitude over to this show, but did anyone else get the feeling that Marienne knew Joe would do something about her ex and was even delighted Ryan croaked? 

If Marienne returns for season 4, it'd be interesting to see if she had the ulterior motive of getting Ryan out of Juliette's life and, like Love, was aware of Joe's darkness all along. She may even be just as manipulative as Joe in a femme fatale type of way and could end up being his demise.
Joe HATES California, get this man back to New York ASAP
I’m feeling like S4 they might switch it up with joe being the one who gets stalked!
Who hurt Joe?

This season was a master piece. I am emotionally drained and still thinking about the show few days later. Just want to say this was the best season and the acting and story and everything was a masterpiece. I still don’t understand how Theo didn’t die with that much blood loss and I still refuse to believe love died. I hope she didn’t but she was such an amazing character man.
Isn’t Love’s mom wondering where her grandson is?
i’m gonna >! miss love so much why do i feel like she didn’t deserve this !<
I really wasn’t a huge fan of Sherry throughout the season, but that moment she and her husband had toward the end was sooooooo wholesome and cute
Cary and Sherry made it a lot better. Theyre hilarious
Did anyone else notice a constant blur around the edges of some shots? Wasn't terrible but was very noticeable in some scenes
The only decent thing to happen in s3 was that Henry went to a loving couple and was safe. It turned my stomach when Love said she wanted another baby, as she only wanted a 2nd child to save her own skin.
If season 4 finally has Joe getting brought down, I feel like Marianne will have a big part in it and I’m not sure if I’m feeling that. She’s stunning, but certainly was in Love’s shadow in terms of character presence all season. I wish it could’ve ended with Love and Joe taking each other down. I feel like we deserved to see a full season of that on itself.
Season 4. Joe in prison because they found his DNA all over everything
I legit thought the season would end differently. Everybody has secrets, and Madre Linda was full of them. Theo’s Dad having access to all the cameras should have been used a lot
more. So many people do illegal things to maintain their lifestyle, because they believe no one is watching. When Theo stole the files I was hoping he would find something to blackmail people with to save Love, or something.  Joe getting away at the end with few repercussions is such a let down.
This season was so wild. I absolutely loved it. I was always on the edge of my seat and never knew what to expect next. I loved all of the character dynamics and how the show makes me root for all of the characters even when they have opposing goals. I’m really glad some of them made it out alive this time and by episode 9 I could see that Love would go down for everything and Joe would get off scot free. (I mean honestly she was very obviously the problem from the first episode, and then when the Gil thing happened it was clear that Joe was going to have to do something about her) It doesn’t cease to amaze me how he’s always one step ahead. Of course, that’s how he’s written so duh, but it still makes for an interesting watch. I love how Love and Joe knew each other so well that they could practically tell what the other was thinking, and then plan around it. 

I love how little details got sown into the plot to come full circle later, like Love planting the Aconite, and the librarian dude whose name I can’t remember right now dropped the line about trying to adopt a child. 

I was really hoping Matthew was going to figure them out, and I’m glad he got the closure in the end. I really liked his character and how he was actually a genuinely decent due. From the introduction, Natalie made him seem like some corporate dude who could care less about his family, but he was totally the opposite. 

I wanted them to get caught, but I also wanted them to make it out without a scratch. I hope Joe doesn’t find Marienne.

I also wanted to say I like how this season pointed out/poked fun at Joe’s hat and hoodie disguise this season when the people he followed actually noticed him following them.
im sad about Henry. I know he is obviously 192737272% better with Dante & his partner but idk as a parent im like i could never leave my baby 😭
I’m seeing a lot of dislike for this season but I personally loved it, I thought Joe and Love working together was ridiculously entertaining and loved both of their side pieces
This season told me a lot about myself. An unsettling amount.
Well that was a wild ride. I both enjoy and hate how this show makes me feel
If Natalie's husband would have reviewed the footage of the Dude who was supposedly having an affair with his wife, he would have noticed the last place he was at was in Love's bakery and during the search in the woods he would have seen Joe sneaking around his place to plant the guy's body... So many red flags to show the cops... How do two people who are dead all have vanished after going to Love's bakery
Do we think he really had to cut off his toes??
So we are meant to believe that Matthew is obsessively watching footage of everyone related to his dead wife, but somehow didn’t catch Gil entering the bakery and never leaving? I was waiting for this revelation when he was about to shut down the program but… nothing?
Spoiler!! Commentary about the ending 
>!Does anyone else feel sad that Love is dead? I know she was a sociopath but I also just wanted her to be loved. I feel like I’ve been mourning her the last few days! I felt like her craziness would never end. I can’t believe she’s gone.!<
Upvote if you are a TRULY optimized man 😉
I fucking despise Joe. God I want him to die a slow, painful miserable death. He deserves nothing less than the absolute worst in this life and the next.
It felt quite sad seeing Love go to be honest. Sure she was evil in the finale, but seeing her go from a sweet and joyful wife and mother to complete self-destruction was upsetting. She was overly protective of her family and got rid of threats in the worst way, but I can't help but feel Joe is truly the culprit here who drove her to do everything she did. All she wanted was to be loved and to have a happy family. It also struck a cord with me when Joe burnt their album. They looked happy in the photos, only to have it end tragically.
i just finished season 3 but i’m still hung up on that jar of urine that joe left in peach’s house
I find it crazy how Joe gets with a girl that is literally the female version of him but still manages to fall out of love and chase after other women
Does anyone else think that this season was too much? I mean don’t get me wrong i enjoyed this season but i think it was a little over the top. i mean at one point my gf and i said out loud “she can’t stop.” S1 and S2 had a reasonable amount of joe and love’s murders but this season i not only question how they could have kept this up without anyone seriously catching on but also how the hell are they gonna follow up a season with this much crime? i feel like they just did too much at once and so fast. nonetheless i liked the season but just felt that not so much needed to be packed in so quick like that, idk anyone else agree?
Something I just picked up on and I’m not sure it was mentioned is I’m pretty sure Cary and Sherry found Loves key instead of Joes. It’s a small thing but it kind of shows how this season went. Joe was always one step ahead of Love.
>!I don’t like Marianne at all. Compared to Love, she has no personality. She was really boring, negative, and always pissed off about something. Rumor has it that season 4 is all about Joe hunting her down, and I don’t think I can get into that.!<
Haven’t seen anyone talk about this yet but it’s all I can think about.. does anyone else think that Love is alive? Going off a few points here.. 1 season three was basically her season, we really got to know her and also her backstory. 2 they never showed her dead, they showed every single other person that has died dead except for her. 3 don’t we think that Love was just as smart as Joe and either grew a tolerance to the wolfsbane or even took the antidote just like Joe?
Last episode. The way Love just stares to the side, lost in thought while sharpening the knife in that same rhythmic motion...... holy fucking chills.
Anyone think that Love is NOT dead? Just a thought...
It’s interesting because I see a lot of people saying they wished Joe died instead of Love and then Love could act as the main protagonist in season 4. But I feel like “You” wouldn’t be “You” without Joe’s presence somehow…

So wouldn’t it be interesting if Love DID try to kill Joe, BUT, she messed up like she did with Theo and he somehow lived? Making Joe get his karma back (regarding Candace) and basically be Love’s Candace in S4, trying to get back at Love, get revenge, and expose her? Then nobody believes him?? Just a thought about how that coulda turned out, it woulda maybe been a cool spin the writers could have.

Still trying to get over the emotional whiplash right now after binging s3 :,)
Just finished Season 3 and loved it. A great cast with smart writing. Victoria Pedretti as Love Quinn shined the brightest for me. The emotions that would cross her face before an outburst (or a murder) were so true that only a great actor could pull that off.
Anyone wanna talk about how Natalie checked out the book “Gone Girl” a week or so before she was murdered? Wild
This season could have been good if they committed to the fact this would be the end of Joe’s arc. Joe is no longer a character we can stand. He kills his wife, he abandons his baby, his new obsession was forced. 

I don’t want a new 4th season of just a retread of season 1.

My bold idea? The season ends with Joe getting his comeuppance either dying or a life sentence in jail. Next season the main character becomes Love and we get to have a season where the woman is the stalker character.
Absolutely loved when the therapist said you are a lot of things but you’re not murderers. The look on their faces were priceless.
I’d love to see Joe caught and go to trial.
I’m way late to this, but I disliked the casting choice for Marianne. She came off way too “Hollywood” for the part in my opinion. The second she came on screen you knew she would be a main character. She seemed very young and I didn’t find their relationship/chemistry with Joe believable. 

It would’ve been fine if she was like Natalie, someone who’s just a device to demonstrate the fleeting nature of Joe’s obsessive habits. But as a long-term character who’s possibly stretching into season 3, I just find myself wishing Love was around. Her character had so much more to it.
Joe is Ted bundy
How the hell did he afford to move to Paris? And whose passport did he use to get there?!
I'm glad he is in a city again, but watching him try to blend in within the suburbs was interesting.

I'm really looking forward to the casts' wardobe next season, that's for sure.
I really love Seasons 1 and 2. I love the cycle of Joe courting his love interest, the flirting, and the euphoria when their relationship starts. In season 1, the back and forth of Beck falling in love with Joe was great. In Season 2, Love started out as an amazing free spirit taking Joe around tinseltown as their relationship grew seemingly overnight.

Which is why I think Season 3 was a bit of a letdown for me. I appreciate that the showrunners wanted to try different things with the Joe/Love dynamic. But it was pretty soul-crushing to see Joe and Love hate being together despite being "soulmates." Season 2 gave viewers the sense that Joe and Love were absolutely perfect for each other so watching Joe despise Love and plot his separation from her is a huge bummer
I'm still confused with Dante, is he supposed to be fully blind? There are scenes he look completely blind, and scenes where he look so normally at Joe. He also answers the door alone and spotted the baby directly?
love was the best thing that happened for that show. low key wished she killed joe off and started her own life. he is too perfect and when the other characters in the show are so unlikeable, i found myself rooting for love and love only. at least she’s with her brother now…
Unpopular opinion and spoiler >!Im not bummed that Joe killed Love!<
At first I didn't like Sherry & Cary at all but by the end I was rooting for them not to die lol. I also found it weird Joe just gave up his son like that, like what is he gonna tell Marianne if he ever (hopefully not) sees her again. Also, I guess he just stopped sending Ellie money??? I hope this is the last season, I'm not sure what they could do with another season. 

&#x200B;

Also I loved Marianne's voice, loved that actor in Sabrina more. Her character was poorly written.
The biggest mistake they made this season was not realizing that the show was no longer about Joe. It was about Love and Joe.
Kinda wish Theo ended up with a pipe through his skull or something
Joe keeps on blaming Love for all of their problems when he’s wayy worse than she is. This might be unpopular, and incorrect since I’m only on episode 2, I kinda feel sorry for Love in a way. I’m not defending her or anything but it seems, to me, that she’s unstable >!and she snapped when she killed Natalie!<
I hated the love interest between Joe and the librarian (she's that forgettable). It felt so forced and without any chemistry.
After all the crazy events >!Love was like “Let’s have another baby”!< …was anyone else absolutely baffled by that? I mean, I kind of get that she figured that would make things better for her but it was still a bit random to me haha.
I kinda wished it was the other way around >!and Love killed Joe.!<
Joe didnt ruin some childs life for once. That is progress right?
I really think this could've been better if they split the season into two and the 6-month gap should've been in between the two seasons instead in the middle of this one.
wow i did not like the ending. would have preferred if love survived. so s4 is just gonna be joe at basically the same place he was at the start of season 1? that’s so lame
SPOILERS AHEAD







Also Marienne was boring af and Theo was annoying af.

Why did they make Theo the new love interest for Love? It doesn't make sense. A more interesting love interest would have been Matthew himself.

Also Marienne...not sure if it was the actress or the boring script or the lack of chemistry with Penn, but I was uninterested in her story. 

I swear they could have made this so much more interesting than they actually have.
For the end of episode 3: it’s the broad daylight for me
I hate the fact that love cheated but nothing happened but when joe does a sliver of it she goes bad shit crazy and kills em
Who was the nerdy kid in joes flash backs for some reason I thought the dude at the bookstore in S 1
There was too much murder this season! But I was glad they let some people get away alive at the end.
Thought Natalie was a cop. LOL boy was I wrong. Some events were predictable, but overall genuinely enjoyed this season.
I kind of don't understand the last episode, he left a lot of his DNA around the house but yet burned down the house BUT yet.. the police still found a lot of DNA? was that like part of the plan to make it seem like joe was struggling to fight her?
Love is the most annoying in this season.
Does anyone know if Season 4 is going to follow book 3? Seems like they basically could with the way they ended it. Obviously the one scene with Love in it would have to be edited out. 

Not sure how I would feel about it because 4 seasons of the same thing would be too much.
**Spoilers**

I frickin loved this season. I think I might be the only one. Couples therapy had me in tears, them teaming up to deal with Natalie like other couples might deal with a flooded basement, the swingers party, Joe's internal dialogue about ruining the marriage via opening it, Cary and Sherry were perfect, Love and Theo's chemistry had me squirming in my seat, getting a deeper look into Joe's brain and his patterns, Love's relationship with her mom, the references to current events without making them a major plot line. Other than the ending, it was a great season for me.
I hope season 4 has to do with Joes mom & half brother..
What I'd like to say is that the Marianne thing felt very forced, like there was no chemistry and real connection between them at all. It made some sense for Joe to want to escape his marriage at that point but why with her? She reminded me of Beck a lot but less interesting because Beck was in season one when everything was a surprise. While with Marianne the plot feels worn out because we already know what to expect.
Did anyone else appreciate the free advice from the counselor? She was spittin
Season 3 is a step down from the other 2 seasons. I think the show has ran its course.
>!Six out of ten at best. The second season was much better. This season had too many filler episodes or a variation of it. Like, only 5 minutes of a whole episode containing main-plot related AND interesting development. !<
I see a lot of people shit on this season, but i really enjoyed it!
Loves like love is definitely gone :( No coming back from the dead like Candace.

https://www.newsweek.com/you-season-3-ending-love-quinn-dead-killed-love-alive-victoria-pedretti-penn-badgley-1638558
So, maybe I just missed it, but is there a reason Natalie's sister doesn't care about her disappearance at all?
In the beginning I thought for sure Merrienne was an under cover agent that had been tracking Joe and his murder sprees. Also by the end I ended up fucking loving Carry and Sherry, they were so weirdly endearing?
Love became soooo irritating in season 3
The first three episodes were just of Joe and Love trauma bonding, she realized it wasn’t love quickly enough and I think the other relationships they were beginning to seek was just to escape accepting that they genuinely didn’t love or like each other
The timing of the bakery makes no sense! 3 days from when they signed the lease to an empty shop, the bakery was fully decked out, up and running and full of stock. That part is killing me
My heart was in my hand when Theo was dead thank the writers he made it alive
am i the only one annoyed by the lighting this season? it’s way too dark.
\*SPOILERS\* 

So I do commercial property management and the scene where >! Joe and Marienne are kissing under the sprinkler head !< absolutely killed me. Like first of all, a library, especially in a mega rich town, probably wouldn't have an automatic wet system, but rather a dry or pre-action system, or something of the like so that in the event of failure it wouldn't destroy the books. But that aside, have y'all ever smelled the water from a sprinkler head? It is NOT sexy, it smells horrid and there's no way you'd want to taste it, no matter how good the kiss is. So nasty. Completely took me out of the scene because I'm not like, there's no way.
I hated the library rain scene where they kiss
I’d hoped it was a fantasy
Just finished season.... wow was brilliant so sad its over. Loved every second of it
"she may come back with henry or a machete" 😭😭😭😭
The ending 


It felt a little anticlimactic,  esiecually Love's death BUT what got me was that Love said, "you gaslit me"

And yes, yes he did, first figuratively then literally.
>!I hated Theo but man hearing him whimper after he got hit in the head made me want to cry. He was just a kid trying to have a relationship with his step-dad and try to be happy!<
Best season so far, some lazy writing here and there but overall there was a lot of good ideas.

The characters were pretty nuanced all in all and the story arcs tied in well together despite some odd elements.

The metaphoric aspect of the plot and its twists worked.

I also think the Marienne romance was well foreshadowed from the get go and that despite what I read Tati Gabrielle was perfect in her role.

Everyone played their part greatly and the ending was perfect with the story being told ; Penn Badgley, Victoria Pedretti, Dylan Arnold, Scott Speedman all killed it.

Considering how things were set up, there's a possibility that a 19/20 yo Henry will be the one to stop Joe, by the time season 4 airs Penn will look more than old enough to convincingly pull off a man around in his 50's.
I liked the season, but I feel like they killed too many people. The amount of ppl dying felt more over the top than other seasons.
>!Netflix loves their X in Paris shows, first  it's Emily in Paris and now it's Nick in Paris.!<
my contribution to this thread is Joe wears sweaters really well
I feel like this is almost an unpopular opinion but I really enjoyed the season! I will admit I thought the end would be a little more shocking. It's not that I found it predictable because I still didn't expect him to kill her and was def like "oh shit" but idk the way people kept talking about the ending being such a twist I expected more than just her trying to kill him turning into him actually killing her.

I know people were criticizing the pacing and that they wanted a more drawn out series of events but if you think about it the Natalie storyline was dragged out the whole season as Matthew was still intent on finding her actual killer. Also, I don't think the murders were necessarily the only focus this season, I think the focus was also, if not more so, on Joe and Love navigating this incredibly toxic relationship dynamic, and trying to do better and be "normal" but ultimately not being able to

Edit: Also, I would have loved more therapy scenes. It was funny seeing them have to find other ways or metaphors to describe what was happening in their lives since they couldn't say what they were actually doing.
can I just say how happy I am somebody noticed that Joe was stalking them?

shout out cappie (Ryan the reporter)
I hate what they did to Love 🥺 I need more Victoria Pedretti in my life!
Who else really wants to be loved that deep that , that passionate, that honest were you can be your complete self the good the bad and the evil  were you would literally do anything in the world for that person. I do i want to be loved like that were we literally are the world to each other. And would do anything for our family and us.
I have a weird feeling Marienne will be the one to kill Joe
Unpopular opinion,

I was less bored watching this season than I was watching season 2. Maybe it’s because I have lived in suburbia and could somewhat relate more than I could have with all of the LA stuff in season 2. I really thought season 2 was just a giant joke of how LA people live and their lifestyles (nothing wrong with it, it just got very redundant). I also never liked Love or Forty from the start and honestly guessed the plot twist from the beginning which I didn’t mind as it was cool to see a change from the previous season. I just never grew to like Love which made it feel like season 2 dragged on but I was interested into what she had to offer in season 3. I think her spiraling out into her “true” self made this season so much more intriguing. She was impulsive and didn’t have all of the brains to fix her messes up like Joe did simply because she never had to.. Joe grew up having to fend for himself in extremely tough situations without help from family like Love had (although her family does suck which is probably a reason she is the way she is) but I don’t think it had anything to do with the writers trying to make her look like a “crazy lady”. It wouldn’t make sense if she knew how to plot all of these things out like Joe does. Also it wouldn’t make her impulsive behavior entertaining. I loved watching her and Joe dual it out throughout the season as they both are so similar.. but I really do think the ending was justified. She never let any man go that she took care of which was mostly Forty growing up but her past husband as well. We knew Joe was going to move on to another victim but he would’ve let Love go since she was the mother to his child and he did care for her in some sick, unhealthy way. Love was the one we knew was going to hold on as she can’t handle the rejection and feeling like the men in her life don’t need her anymore. It’s not surprising what she tried to do in the end to Joe. And if written another way such as keeping that persona she held in season 2 before the plot twist, it wouldn’t have been an interesting 3rd season. We had twists and turns each episode for two characters rather than one. These two going back and forth would’ve gotten old if it carried on another season. Hopefully they can think of a plot that won’t be another season 1 but I also like the idea that there are so many more possibilities out of there than just seeing Love become impulsive and Joe cleaning the mess.
Who leaves their door unlock after paralyzing their husband? Also how does the neighbor know not to call the police bc joe blinks 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Even the “world is out to get me” woe is me” librarian s a pos while pretending to be holy than thou... honestly Cary and sherry end up being my favorite characters— didn’t see that coming
I couldn’t stand love this season she basically was a big hypocrite.
I keep watching hoping it ends
 This show is going on too long with no end in sight. And i cant not watch it when a new season comes out ughhh
I feel like Dottie (Glamma, as one reviewer referred to her as, lol) had a weird storyline this season. Like, the lead up to her breakdown only really seemed to serve the purpose of getting her angry enough at Love, & alone with Joe, to bring up the fact that she suspected Love had killed her first husband. Maybe I missed something else but I feel like out of everything this season, to me? It seemed to fit the least with the story they were trying to tell.
how does a dead man fly to France? 🤔 how would he ever get away with not having a passport
[deleted]
I don’t care, this is a Cary and Sherry stan account now
I loved it!!! 

But, Scott Speedman, you really obsess over Natalie leaving the bakery and not check out the camera footage across the street!?

And Joe becoming more obsessed with a new woman ever 12 months makes him less interesting, because then it’s like oh you’re lying to yourself and us. You’ll never be happy and continue this cycle forever.

Lastly, without Love the dynamic of the show feels off. It’s just Joe the killer and an innocent woman.
I don’t get it why so many users here hate the way Joe goes ”around” with his obsession, saying he should move on. The show is based on him getting obsession on women. Why is that so upsetting?
Trying to imagine how they’ll do season 4 because Joe’s cycle of obsession with new women constantly is getting old and tired. I’m disappointed that we won’t get to see anymore of Love. I was lowkey rooting for her to kill Joe at the end. But at the same time it would’ve been disappointing if he was killed off. This show messes w my emotions bc in essence Love and Joe are murderers and manipulators and horrible people, but I…like them?? And find myself rooting for them ? Liked this season overall but I think 2 is still my fav
Really did not understand the Theo/Love thing. Just felt it was thrown in for the sake of drama. Think the only people I was rooting for by the end was Cary, Sherry and Henry
Series 3 started with Joe committed to doing anything to protect Henry & the family, yet he completely abandons this after episode 4
I just wanna say I was reading a lot of comments where people were frustrated with Love and her decisions I definitely was too. The only issue is that I think I liked her more because I had to put up with joes shit for like 3 seasons now and he’s just annoying as fuck to me at this point. Like if you think about it forty wouldn’t be dead love’s life wouldn’t be as fucked up as it was with joe’s he’s a black hole. And Love matched that energy always. That’s why they never worked. I just don’t wanna deal with joes shit anymore so imma just stop at this season 😂
Whiplash is a really good description for this season. 

So many emotions rolling in and out throughout the season. Victoria did a phenomenal job this season and both her and Penn knocked it out of the park this season. Their onscreen chemistry really made it. 

Also Theo was a really good character addition to the season.
Having watched episode 8, how could anyone think Marianne is boring or bad writing. Her scene with Joe at the liquor store is truly a great scene and has chemistry at least in my opinion
I just finished and it's almost 4am 

I honestly really enjoyed the therapy growth and relapse. People don't realize that once you feel "done" with therapy, it doesn't stop. You need to keep doing the self work, otherwise it'll go back to the old ways

It was really disappointing to know super early in the show that Joe no longer wanted to be with Love and that he was basically playing the long game on how to get out of that situation. Like everyone else, I would have enjoyed seeing them grow as a murderous couple. The psychopath and sociopath, perfect for each other and yet not quite.

I do feel for Theo and the fact that while Love didn't fully reject him and push him away, she still kept him along for the attention and then for information from his dad. I was actually very proud of Joe to actually send Theo to the hospital.

It was honestly really funny to see Matthew find Joe paralyzed and literally leave him as is. Now that was one justified dick move lmao

There's just so many different things to talk about but oh man oh man. Oh and Marienne was soooo sexy and I don't blame Joe on his obsession this season.
You know what fuck it, I don't feel bad for Theo at all. Y'all out here being mad his ass got thrown around like ragdoll after hating him all season. Not me, my morals are firmly off while watching this show and he's been annoying. Sorry Theo, suck to suck.
Did anyone find it relatable in some ways to the Gabby Petito case? I’m only on episode 4 maybe I should watch it more but I notice little things like the missing woman in the woods, they mention white girl syndrome?
Damn near cried when >!Joe left Henry with Dante.!< It really felt so conclusive because I feel like>! Joe really did want to protect him!<
Does anyone else feel like Joes childhood flashbacks were a waste of time? The only time they seemed to matter was that Joe has a hard time relating to men, seeing them as monsters rather than potential friends.  The whole Fiona thing was very boring and felt like stuff we already knew. I wish that time could have been used to flesh out Love more and her spiral down as a person. Or something else entirely.
Not sure how much all the flashbacks add up in minutes but I feel like a whole episode of time was used up for them.
I was rooting for Love so hard this season I hope she’s not dead…
For those who read the book, how did this compare to Hidden Bodies? (or was that more in s2?) I just started it today, so am only about 20% through
They wasted Scott Speedman. Not sure how writers could see his performance in Animal Kingdom and then make his character so limited and dull.
Season 3 is ridiculous, lots of eye rolling, but still I think I enjoyed it more than season 2 because in season 2 I knew what was up with Love from the 1rst episode and that kinda made the rest of the season anticlimactic.
The story line almost went Sweeney Todd the demon barber of Fleet Street and Love’s name is too good of a coincidence to be a diminutive of Mrs Lovett
Ok, i have a question that I would love to hear your responses from… didn’t Joe kind of fuck himself up though with that ending? i mean he’s supposed to be dead but looks exactly like himself and is wondering around in PUBLIC before things even died down…, and if anyone ever sees him without his shoes on or socks on, which i’m guessing is bound to happen at some point, he has toes missing… the exact toes that were the only things found from the dead joe. i feel like it would be too easy to put two and two together and find him out or am i missing something?
Anyone think her bakery’s name sounds like a fresh fart? Came here to ask only this
Wow, Love looked absolutely stunning this season. All her outfits looked so nice on her. Victoria's acting was top-notch.

I binge-watched it all in one day and what a ride. The first few episodes were so good. They had such a different dynamic compared to the other two seasons. I loved the therapy sessions. >!I wonder what their therapist thought at the end.!< It got boring when it went back to the obsession formula though.

I felt like this was a really good spot to end the show. No idea how they can top this season and make it unique with >!Love dead. The swinging scene was so unexpected but hilarious af - I had my doubts, but glad Cary and Sherry made it out in the end. !<
I would also like to point out the Matthew had pi's looking into every neighbours past, how the actual fuck didn't Joe's past come out? his last 2 girlfriends died one of which reported him to the police.
Was anyone else low-key rooting for Love? As much as I love Joes character, I wanted to see the dynamic of Love as the main character and her being psycho for another man in season 4. When she was laying on the floor at the end I was screaming for her to get up lol. 

Also just to clarify I know it wouldn’t have made sense for that to happen, I just LOVED her character so much.
Enjoyed this season but definitely not in the same way as season 1&2. I wasn’t surprised Joe lost interest and eventually killed Love at the end since he was going to season 2 but found out she was pregnant but she stopped being his dream girl by the end of season 2.  I didn’t feel the connection between Joe and Marianne. Marianne practically hated Joe until she found out about his childhood and then BOOM she was all into him. Also with how she came off in the beginning I find it surprising she would be into having relations with a married man. Somehow the ridiculousness of Joe not being suspected/getting away with the crimes seemed more out there this season. Joe and Love never wore gloves! I think they missed an opportunity with not having Matthew be more suspicious and either almost finding out all the murders or actually catching on would’ve been more suspenseful. Also he had camera access everywhere but saw nothing and was never suspicious the fact that Natalie had drinks with Joe and then Love was the last person to see her alive. I never really felt that Joe was ever at risk of being caught so it made things less exciting. Plus how did no one think it was weird minders started happening in “safest town” soon after Joe and Love moved to town and they had a connection to every person? Although the age gap between Love and Theo was creepy, it made sense because Love comes across immature and needy so not surprising that she may be with a younger man. 

Lastly…

1. How the heck Joe and Love have money when Joe volunteered and Love had the bakery that only ever had 4 customers and she kept giving free cupcakes to Theo?? I know Joe stole and then repurposed rare books to sell but that doesn’t seem like he’d make enough off of that plus the fact that he appeared to stop when Marianne somewhat caught him. 

2. Where does Joe get the money for the heavy duty cages? He already doesn’t seem to have enough money for his everyday life. Those can’t be cheap. Also how does he build them so fast?

3. Anyone else find it interesting that Nurse Fiona looked a lot like his mom? But I was annoyed that they flew past the fact that he found his mom and that she had another kid and that was that. They had too much  going on in the plot at the same time. 

4. Season 3 should’ve been the finale and don’t think there should be a season 4
This was one of the greatest seasons of television I’ve ever seen. Never thought I’d ever take this show seriously but Penn and Victoria deserve Emmy’s. Holy shit. What an acting masterclass 👏🏻🤯🤩😭🙌
Finally finished it, crazy season.
Tbh, I kinda wish the show revolved after Love after her performance this season.
The best season IMO
I am so disappointed. It started well and then just, ruined to me. 
Everything seemed so awkward past ep 4. 
I hate that >!Love is not there anymore. She was a very good character.!<
I hate that after all that "I love you more than anything" speech, >!Joe just gives Henry away. (I know it was for the best and he ends up with good people but still)!<
Marianne was not a likeable character whatsoever, I'm so over the "I'm gonna be a jerk to you until you prove yourself worthy to me because I have personal issues" attitude. The only time I liked her was at her very end dialogue. Girl was spot on. >!So I'm glad she lived.!<

Just end it. It's over. YOU ruined it, Netflix.
Sherry and Carey saved this season for me. They went from being these silly tropes to just pure comedic genius. My favorite characters by FAR in this show.
I think there’s such a good metaphor here for Joe and Loves progression in their relationship. The cage started with Joes library to preserve his books. Earlier on in the seasons, he was the perpetrator of his crimes. In season 3, the cage is built to preserve Love’s baking ingredients and coincidentally she’s become the one to initiate most of the murders in the show. Idk if they did that on purpose but it was a nice touch.
That was a nice house, I couldn’t believe he blew it up.
I was crying when he gave Henry up to Dante & Lansing. That was such a good part of the season.
Y'all, I just wanna say that this season was a wild ride.
I don’t understand how Matthew didn’t hack the cameras that were overlooking the glass cage in the basement but every other one in the city
When i heard the first couple notes of exile i screamed. Love the Taylor/You crossover
So what’s he going say when he finds Marianne?
Does anyone know if Love's mom, Dottie, knows the history of Love and Joe? Dottie called him Joe many times on the show when in s2 he was known as Will to everyone but Love. I know the Quinn family helped with the investigation at the end of s2 but does that mean they know everything?
What was Joe referring to when he said “What's got you stepping out of your routine? I dearly hope it doesn't involve pegging someone on this bed, RIP Peach. “ it seems like a reference from a previous season but I don’t remember?
I really hope they don't make a season 4.
How did Joe leave the country and get through airport sercurity and customs etc?? Even if he used another fake identity I feel like it wouldn’t have been that easy…
I think the ending was fine, but I really hope the focus isn’t entirely on Marienne next season. 

I don’t know what would make Joe happy or finish his arc tho? I mean he wants to “fix” problems these women have but then he’ll have nothing else to do, or they will find out his dark secrets so he’ll kill them and chase another one. It’s just dumb and never ending. But he did have some redeeming qualities, he saved Theo(this season’s Ellie/paco I guess) and he didn’t want to plant evidence and frame Matthew. Def seemed rational when compared to Love lol
I know this is a nit to pick, but the actor that played Theo (Dylan Arnold) is actually a year older than Victoria Pedretti, yet he was supposed to be a teenager and she was supposed to be a late 20s / early 30s suburban mom.  It kept throwing me off when she referred to him as a kid while he treated her like she was in her mid 40s (with the John Cusack "Say Anything" reference, that is a GenX movie)
This season really jumped the shark
interesting how they nonchalantly named the missing/dead white female "Natalie"
Will there be a crossover next season where Joe stalks Emily in Paris?
Love when Joe pulls his mask down to murder ryan in front of a business, where there would likely be cameras. One of the biggest themes/plots of this season is surveillance, and that basically nowhere is safe from cameras. 

Nit picky, I know, just one of those dumb things shows do that bugs me. Had pretty low expectations for this season and I thought it was enjoyable overall. Wasn’t bored watching it. I think season 4 has a good chance to be a bounce back season.
What is happening with the camera this season? The edges are like super fringed and the depth of field is so bizarre.

Like 70% or the screen is not in focus in every shot… once you realize it it is so hard to ignore
I love how in the beginning we are led to hate Sherry and Cary and they actually  end up being very redeeming characters!
How are they going to make a 4th season? That was a good ending to the series.
That suburban neighborhood was the most fakest town I’ve ever seen and I would hate to live there.
I personally didnt like this season. I think the direction of where the story went in s3 kinda just felt repetitive and disingenuous. I understand that love and joe would have problems, but every single episode they would hate their lives then find a way back to love each other for a moment, then go back to fuckin their side pieces. If anything i think the show should have ended with both of them dying
I dont like how quickly Joe killed Love, I think it would've been a hell of a lot emotionally effective if he injected her and the "we're perfect for each other, but not for Henry" bit but longer, that sort of thing
So isn't anyone wondering how Henry ended up on Dante's door step? Doesnt this prove Joe is alive, especially since only 2 fingers of his body were found?
The sudden cut to Cary and Sherry after Joe killed love, completely took all the tension and weight out of the scene for me, I think they should've removed that scene and just had Sherry notice the key earlier, because that sudden cut to that kinds ruined it for me
I'm done with You now , not sure I could handle a 4th season. It's all just to samey, I wish they had both actually died.
Can we talk about how Joe was absolutely NOT likeable is this season? Sure, he is the bad guy, he’s not suposed to be likeable. But when he starts to stalk Marienne, initiating another cycle of obsession, I was just bored. Then I got thrilled when he had his ass kicked by Ryan or when Love talked to Marienne in front of a helpless Joe. I just wish he was the one going down for good!
I hope this show is done for good. The ending seems to be left open incase they want to do another season. I feel like it would be ridiculous, and also overly repetitive. Like he can’t keep getting away with it..Also, I just don’t think they’ll ever be able to top Love’s character arc
Finished the season but could not and cannot get over the utter absurdity of Gil’s suicide note. If it wasn’t suspicious enough that it was printed, there is *no fucking way* that his wife wouldn’t have known he didn’t write it.
I honestly think season 4 will end with the PI that Peaches family hired finally catching up with Joe and having him either killed or put in Jail. I think we see Ellie return as well and Theo via the emergence of his USB drive.


Love was incredibly difficult to watch this season but I think that was the point, we were meant to grow the disdain for her in the same way that Joe does.
Wanted to love Marianne but her story was not only thin but also boring. This season felt like two different shows mashed together in the middle. The first half was so good and I thought the second episode was maybe the strongest of the whole series. That being said, I had to push myself to get through those last few episodes. I’m sad Love is gone, I thought the episode from her perspective was pretty heartbreaking.
So I didn’t like Season 2, but boredom drove me to try this season out and now I can confirm: this is one of the most overrated “popular” shows in recent memory. 

For a show that’s supposed to be suspenseful/thriller there’s hardly any suspense because characters never face any real consequences for their evil actions. According to the writers Joe can essentially just kill anyone he has any type of conflict or issue with and face zero repercussions ever, so why would you ever be invested in the conflicts in the show ? 

I feel like to enjoy this show, your suspension of disbelief has to be even higher than when you watch a superhero movie. And Marianne fails as a character because the writers failed to give any truly interesting qualities.
Man I loved this season but I feel like Joe and Love get so much sloppier all the time and really should’ve been caught by now. Like when Joe killed Marianne’s ex he very distinctly touched his jacket and the cops just didn’t check him for finger prints? Also this town has cameras EVERYWHERE and Joe and Love were practically never seen with a body? Or Joe managing to fly to Paris despite being “dead”. Don’t get me wrong, I REALLY enjoyed this season, but I feel like every season strays further from the realms of realism.
I don't get what the point of the flashbacks was, it shows >!the nurse being abused, I thought it could have been an interesting angle if they played it as: The nurse grooming Joe, noticing his obvious mother-issues, using him as a pawn to get rid of her abusive partner and rewarding him for it, leading him further onto this path of associating love with murder...Instead the nurse gets killed by her partner, Joe does nothing, and it just culminates with him going to see his mother after his friend says "You'll never know why your mother left you here" which seems to trigger him into looking for her. But the thing is, he could have done that without the whole nurse backstory side-plot, so what was the point?!<
One thing about this series I never understand is how is it so easy for Joe to sneak into people's houses like😭
Someone like Ryan definitely would have a security system
OKAY but what if Love isn’t dead 🥺 imma keep telling myself that.
Does anyone else think it was joe not love who deserved to die ?
I really feel like this season was perfect but also it concluded the story in a satisfying way and I genuinely think it is a mistake to do a season 4.
If they ended the show right here it would be a perfect ending. Season 4 just seems like a gratuitous thing at this point in that there is more risk than reward. Where Joe goes from here would be better off left to the viewer's imagination than turned into yet another season. 

I say this with respect as I do love the show. I really, genuinely, sincerely think that they "got the job done " with season 3 and only risk turning the show into something like the Walking Dead where it goes on forever for no reason.

All character arcs have been resolved.
Anyone else extremely sad/pissed that Love died?  I just was waiting for her to make a comeback, to finally come back to herself.  And then Joe fucking did what he does best.  

So crazy to me because throughout this season they’ve seemed like the best enemies, one always trying to maintain the upper hand, and Joe finally did to her what they’ve done together to so many other people.  

Her last words “We’re perfect for each other, but bad for Henry” really got me.  They were perfect for each other, maybe too perfect.
I just wish Dante had a bigger role, he seemed like such an interesting character.
Felt like watching a softcore porn. Just don't put on loudspeaker!
How did he get to Paris as a dead man? New identity?
Anyone else feel like they rushed the ending of this season? Like there was hardly any time between Joe meeting Marianne and falling in love with her. We never got to see him creep on her, take souvenirs, etc. It's just like suddenly they're both in love when they've had minimal interaction. Felt too fast
Okay, I did not connect to Marienne AT ALL, and honestly kind of rolled my eyes at both Joe and Love for the entire show post their ending therapy. I just wanted to shake them and go “you two kids knock this shit off already!”. But then I guess we wouldn’t have a show if they knocked off… knocking people off…
have read a lot about lazy writing and characters' stupidity this season

is it just me or  >! when love was confronting marienne, and marienne's kid came to the door, obviously no decent parent - esp one so in tune w danger & protecting her child's future - would allow her kid to enter that environment, however desperately she needed to pee?!? moreover, wouldn't anyone take the opportunity to FUCKING FLEE at that moment. impossible that you wouldn't get violent if not murderous vibes from love in that moment !<

I thought the writing this season was not as good as the second, and moments like these really irked me
Dear lord, please save Emily in Paris from Joe!! 😬
Is anyone confused that there in the bay area and acknowledge that corona is going on. But somehow all of the bay area doesn't wear masks in the the show? That's a joke. 😄 Good luck seeing a face in a coffee shop in San Jose.
I think Theo should have been played by a younger looking guy so it could be more obvious how messed up it was she was sleeping with the teenage neighbor.
IMHO The most annoying thing about this season wasn’t the show itself, but the watchers. Why do people keep having these arguments about who the better person is between Joe and Love. They are both crazy and they are both murders. They have different reasons for their murders, but neither of them are justified. They also both have there own hypocrisies, and their own infidelity throughout the season. So stop trying to claim that one of them has higher moral standards than the other, because personally both of them are crazier than a shit house rat. As for season 4, I see a lot of people complaining that it’s going to be the same shtick of Joe stocking a girl and then having to kill people in order to earn her love before it ultimately all comes crashing down on him. Like…no shit. Why are people annoyed by this? That’s literally the premise of the whole show. As long as the story is good who cares. My only hope is that the writers step away from the same four or five sides characters that they have written into every season so far.
I’d be so happy if the series ended here. This feels like it’s about to be dragged out for so long it’ll kill the show.
I loved the serial killer couple dynamic and although I liked the ending I'm kinda sad about love being dead instead of Joe. She was way more interesting than him in this season, would like to see more. They could've shifted the protagonist. Anyway, the ending scene in Paris was perfect. They could(maybe should) just end the series right here.  
Because what'll probably come next(Joes downfall) is so predictable that it's boring.
I binged it last night. It was SO good but Damn..,, Love truly is a serial killer.
I knew there was something about her 1st husband we were missing but I never thought she played a part in his death!
The re were a few things that really bothered me.

Love was VERY crunchy while living in LA.  The whole QUINN family's vibe was privileged yet extremely hippie.
Love was very chameleon like while trying to fit in her environment but I found it strange Love gave birth in a hospital and was very pro vaccine. This struck me as odd since she talked about past lives, reincarnation, cupping and seemed a little out there while living in LA and then moves to the suburbs and becomes mainstream, CA mainstream but still extremely vanilla. The Love in last season wouldn't have Called out and  shut down her mothers vineyard speaker about "finding joy". 

She seemed to be coming apart and at first I thought it was PPD and we were going to see Joe frame her for everything and PPD being blamed but no, just her inner serial killer slowly coming undone with no patience, or restraint.

The character of Mathew really was glossed over. A bored unhappy wife of a workaholic goes missing and he suddenly loses his mind refusing to believe the story that eventually comes out....Gil's supposed affair and obsession with 
Natalie. His relationship with Theo was weird. I feel there should have been more depth there. 
And Theo knew e everything, he was the videos he knew Love AND Joe were both involved but yet never said??
I wish he has said to Mathew "I wish I remembered what happened. I don't even remember meeting them..." and Mathew saying something about the Dr's saying he may never recover that part of his memory...just SOMETHING to explain why he didn't go to the cops and spill everything. Sherry and Carey didn't really either. It's like maybe they were better off saying LOVE or Joe shot them then they shot each other accidentally....besides guess they can't make a fortune giving inspirational talks and pushing their new method of care marriage therapy if anyone knew the truth.
[deleted]
The one thing that bugs me is that clearly Love and Joe are complete psychopaths. But yet they seem to show affection and emotions toward different events. I guess I really think they should have been emotionless but that wouldn’t have been good tv. Love does show it toward the end though with her blank stares.
One plothole I thought for sure would come up is when Ryan was attacked in the parking garage he was directly under a camera.  Not exactly hard for the police to find that it wasn't a simple robbery.
Y’all I just finished and I’m gonna miss Love bigly.
Season 1 will always be my favorite but i thought this season was pretty good, the tension of the dinner scene at the end was great. I thought the Marianne character and storyline fell totally flat though, maybe because there was so much going on this season I just didn’t feel like the obsession with her grew as naturally as his targets in past seasons, I didn’t feel any type of way about her at all
I have a few negative opinions about this season but one element I really enjoyed was the amount of times we got faked out with thinking people were dead. Carey while camping, Ryan (when he was pushed), Theo, and sherry and Carey after the swingers night. I genuinely didn’t expect any of them to survive their injuries and really enjoyed the twists
Is it just me or did the dinner scene of last ep remind anyone of Mr. And Mrs. Smith? I also just finished "only murders in the building " and couldn't help but compare Penn's paralyzed acting to Steve Martin's 🤣 On a final note, i loved the scene of Joe and Love both walking up with weapons when they thought the other couple overheard them. The season could've ended there for me lol
Kinda wish the marienne thing didn’t happen and instead we got the Mary Kay story line from the third book?
I just finished episode 10. This show is fucking unreal. Whoever wrote this are fucking geniuses. Like this isn’t even a regular plot twist show, it’s so above that.
I really wish Joe and Love kept there Bonnie and Clyde/Mr. and Mrs. Smith relationship

like it just work more, now Love is gone....
On Episode 6 right now and Joe's new interest (library girl, i forget her name) is downright annoying. I saw a spoiler for the last episode in the season and see they end up forming something. I feel like she will ruin the show for me. I hope her character flaws mellow out as time goes on.
Just came here to say that Dante was my favorite character through this whole season. 🙌
A different suggestion for last episode(kinda gruesome): >!What if love had prepared this nice dinner for him and it was actually marienne, and she could’ve said “does she taste good now?” I think it would’ve been a perfect touch and it proves how insane and how far love could go.!<
Is Theo not cringey as hell to anyone else. Like is he supposed to be a heartthrob or something?
Just finished and honestly really enjoyed season 3. The finale was really good as well. Can’t lie I absolutely hated Theo, not sure if it was the actor or the character itself but fucking hell he annoyed the shit outta me. Still can’t tell who’s more of a psycho either, both cheated, both killed. Also, the swinging scene with Joe and Sherry was low-key hot lmao
It’s so funny when talking about this show because people talk about it as if Love and Joe just ✨kill people✨but like these people are legit serial killers. They kill people for no legitimate reason and on top of they think what they’re doing is righteous. I get it’s a show but it’s interesting how the show managed to get people to humanize murderers.

That being said the show was decent I was entertained and i actually enjoyed watching. The affair storylines were cringey as hell though and they all had 0 chemistry. 

What annoyed me was how much Joe and Love could just get away with sloppy and pointless murders because people couldn’t critically think. I guess plot armor saved them but I feel like it’s not hard to connect Joe to his murders. He had the same name as when he was in new york so a detective or PI could’ve found more info on him and find out his ex girlfriend, her ex, and her best friend all died. and then he comes to no cal and a bunch of people in his neighborhood die. Like you could literally pull a joe on joe he’s not that clever, dude just wears a hat and sits in the background. and it’s not even hes invisible, people see him and walk up to him or mention it to him. Likeeee a PI could’ve found out he killed mariennes ex. That shit was frustrating. But it’s a show so yknow
I kind of wish they kept the Joe-Love "power couple" thing going a little longer for one more season, and then ended the series in a sort of Breaking Bad fashion with both of them getting themselves in too deep and dying together.
Theory here: Is Henry really Joe's son? I re-watched S2 and Love last had sex with Milo before she killed Delilah and told Joe she was pregnant. Just thinking maybe that's the reason why Henry kept crying whenever Joe held him? Thoughts?
Late to the party but just finished Season 3 and found it disappointing. Season 2 was far superior. Still it was entertaining though, but my god, the amount of douchebag characters in the show made it so hard to watch.

That thirsty pathetic kid, can you **** off? Seriously.

Love being completely stupid, and annoying with her overacting eyes.

And finally, episode 8 was probably the most awkward, most cringe episode to ever be committed to TV history. I challenge you to find me anything more awkward, uncomfortable than that episode. I think even the staff who were doing the filming probably felt uncomfortable.

Anyway good to see he’s in Paris now, seems like a fresh setting for season 4.
Also, Is the twins being name Love and Forty a tennis joke?
Joe is fucking despicable. Definitely think it would've been a much more interesting ending if Love actually got away and the show followed her afterwards.

I hated Joe this season. I get he's not a good person but wow, he was just completely irredeemable.

Will continue to hate-watch this show until he gets his comeuppance.
I feel like Cary's gun was a weird thing to add into the mix.

Firstly why tf didn't he go for the gun ONLY HE KNEW WAS THERE?!

Second, I can see love giving it to them because she's unhinged, but now you left them inside with a loaded firearm which makes getting them out much harder.

Third, them shooting eachother was so pointless. Like the first was an accident but I don't get how you can turn on eachother so fast and NEARLY KILL your husband.
It bothers me that Theo was the only one who thought to check the camera across the street from the bakery’s driveway to confirm that Joe drove Natalie’s car. Matthew had been obsessing over every camera and bit of footage for weeks, and Theo figured it out just like that??
Joes 2 toes were cut off and everyone believes he’s dead without the body? Doesn’t add up
>!I understand needing a life change after some shit that goes down in your life but if I had killed multiple people and thought that I killed my teenage boy toy (who's father is a tech mogul) I wouldn't be telling my husband that we should have a second child. I would suggest cutting our losses and leaving the country.!<

Love's quivering sad mouth and her affinity for impulse killing is too much for me this season dear god
>!Spoiler!< What I loved (and hated) about this season was how the writers force us to confront how deeply terrible Joe is. In season 1 & 2, it was easy to delude myself into rooting for him - we are watching from inside his head. Last season I was invested in the possibility that he could finally stop killing, for Love. And that there would be a happy ending for a character who has lived such a troubled life.

But this time around, it was painfully obvious that that’s never going to happen. The writers destroy this idea by showing a marriage (the ultimate happy ending in our culture) that is deeply unhappy. Joe has finally “gotten” the object of his obsession but he isn’t satisfied.

The juxtaposition of Joe’s narcissism and hypocrisy - and the inherent misogyny of it all- made it impossible for me to stay on his side. The way he judges Love when she kills, but justifies every act of violence that he commits - it is obvious that he will never truly keep his own moral code. Also, the way he cares for children but ultimately abandons them. Sending money to Ellie is quickly deprioritized when he has a new obsession. He leaves his son on a doorstep.

Ultimately I felt like the point of this season was the monotony and repetition. We can see his pattern so clearly in season 3, from his budding obsession with Natalie, to his full-blown obsession with Marianne, to know that he will never change and the “catch and kill” cycle will constantly be repeated until he’s stopped. The happiest ending we’re going to get is him finding a new obsession in Rikers.

And that’s honestly my hope - that the next season will be the last, and Joe will finally be caught - and his cycle of harm against women will end. Back to what I said, I loved this season because it shines the light on how deeply terrible Joe is, and forces us to confront his misogyny. But I hated it because it brushed up too closely with our reality, where abusive men like Joe are forgiven and adored despite their actions- and ultimately, get away with it.

i feel like they relied so much on the natalie twist to make the season engaging and interesting, but when i got to the end i felt bored and disappointed. his fixation on marianne started way too late, leaving an undeveloped love interest and his decisions later in the season to be flimsy and dumb. she’s a mismatched, water-downed hybrid of love and beck—his sassy boss who loves books and is troubled. she has nothing moderately interesting or unique about her. joe already killed beck and candace(technically, imma count it), >!so their decision to kill off love!< felt re-used and backwards. i think she had the opportunity to have so much more plot—she hadn’t reached the end of what she could give to the show. the side characters felt less developed than those in previous seasons, although i was entertained by shelly and cary at some points. i think joe has a redeeming personality trait of wanting to protect the innocent(children). we see this with paco and ellie—it didn’t make sense for him to >!abandon henry.!< if it were true to his character; he would have adored this child to the very end, it’s the one thing that has consistently shown his humanity. so for them to also abandon that faucet of their previous writing really irked me. i didn’t hate this season, but i now know the show is on a very quick downward spiral. either season 4 will surprise me or it’ll confirm that the show peaked at season 2 and has nothing more to give me.
How the show SHOULD have ended: 


Joe sets the house of fire and flees the country, thinking all his problems with Love are now over. Love manages to survive and escapes. Season 4 would be Joe hunting down Marienne in France, while Love is also tracking down Joe. A worldwide manhunt is set out for Love, as everyone suspects she had killed Joe and set the house on fire to cover her tracks. Love kills Marienne at the end of season 4. In season 5, Love and Joe get arrested and finally face the consequences of their actions. In trial they testify against each other, trying to pin the blame on one another for all of the murders they’ve committed. 

Joe killing Love made for a boring and predictable ending. I don’t think their story should’ve ended here. I wanted to see Love outsmart Joe somehow. 

P.S. how tf did Joe make his way to France? If he uses his passport to fly, surely it would alert the system and then it’d be known he’s actually alive 🤔
I needed to vent about how STUPID this season was and how it made me realize that Joe isn't looking for the perfect woman for him (which was/is Love), he's obsessed with being obsessed. It's the chase, the new feelings, the obsessing over every little detail - that's what Joe is in love with, not the women themselves. Once Love accepted him her fate was sealed. If season 4 follows the same storyline of him finding a woman only to kill her and move to the next, I won't be watching because that is both predictable and overused. I really hope the writers do better
I just don't get how a supposed experienced serial killer like Joe could so poorly cover up his affair with Maryanne. You'd think if he really cared about Maryanne safety and wanted to avoid love finding out and killing her, he would have been more vigilant in covering it up. Like, get another secret phone to talk to Maryanne on for a starters, all of Maryannes texts saying "can we talk" and "can I come over" just appeared up on his lock screen  when love was in the room lmao. 

Also, after killing Maryanne's ex, you'd think the first think he'd do is destroy all evidence, including the bloodied shirt. Yet he wore it in the house for ages, then panics as soon as love returns home and chucks it in the trash can. 
This could also be congruent with Joe's character though, how he gets very carried away as soon as he gets a new obsession and it's as if nothing else matters.
Am I the only one who is bummed that >!love is dead now?!< I was routing for Love to take Joe out somehow maybe temporarily and have the next season be centered around her. Like who gives a fuck about joe I’ve been routing for love since we were introduced to her
What does the note to Dante and Lansing say when Joe drops Henry off on their porch? Isn’t Joe supposedly dead?
Two things. 

One, the names Love was looking at for their next child was Julie, Julia. When Juliette walked in on Love and Marienne’s conversation i bugged out and got scared LOL

Two, Joe mentioned Ellie a few times earlier in the series but then that whole plotline kind of got dropped? Was hoping for more of that.

All in all, great final few episodes but a little slow in the middle. Sad that Love is gone, really liked her.
Just finished S3, and this is probably an unpopular opinion, but it really feels like this show has jumped the shark.  There's been at least a baker's dozen murders committed in the time span of a few years (Joe's abuser, Jasper, candaces bf, Candace, Benji, Paige, Beck, Pacos abuser, Delilah, Henderson, fortys nanny, loves first husband, Natalie, Gil, Ryan, and love herself). Serial killers are prolific in part because both they and their victims are often pretty low profile. I think I've read estimates that there may be anywhere between 30 and 50 serial killers active in the US at any given time, and we don't hear much about them.

I get that this is fiction and exploring the concept of solving relationship problems with violence, but we're three seasons in and the most cop involvement we get lasts about one scene.

With loves suicide note, she says she coerced Joe... But surely some true crime folks would look into the fact that Joe Goldberg, the deceased formerly of New York was a known associate of Guinevere Beck and all the disappearances and deaths around that. And the whole Sweeney Todd aspect would be picked apart pretty quickly, I would imagine.

Anyways, the show is fun, but I personally may just check here for the season 4 synopsis as it's gotten to be the same MO (Joe meets girl, stalks girl, woos girl, kills girl) just more and more dramatic each iteration, imo. Thanks for letting me rant some.
I’m so pissed about the ending. We all know that Joe had a wondering eye but he was so in love with Love and they had identical personalities. *SPOILER* They both shouldn’t have cheated (maybe the kissing was ok) and should of realized that they loved each other. *SPOILER* Imagine another season showing how the kid grew up and maybe even found out about the murders that Joe and Love committed?? Thoughts??
Why did Joe want a daughter so bad?
I had a blast binge-watching this show with my friends. I can't wait to hear Joe's internal monologues about Parisians.
Joe has SO many loose ends at this point: 
Peach’s family PI 

Ellie 

Matthew & Theo 

Sherry & Cary 

Will 

Paco 

Marienne 

Maybe: 

Quinn family PI/Dottie. Now that Love is gone Dottie will want Henry and might go after Joe or the murders of Delilah and Candace could show his involvement. How can they explain those since they’re not connected to Madre Linda? 

I feel like Free Dr Nicky/Peaches PI and Matthew/Theo working together would be enough to catch him right there. Also if Elsie met up with them since she’s not getting paid, could be an interesting team for season 4
What is with the “only the center is in focus” thing? It is distracting and annoying. Show is decent, but I find this “blurriness outside the center” off-putting.  If someone calls this is artistic, I call shenanigans.
[removed]
honestly, I am so glad they killed Love off. I never liked her. I feel like I should have at least rewatched s2 before starting this one but I don't think it was necessary. 

My favorites were Cary and Sherry towards the end, I actually started to feel bad for them once they let down that facade. (I also love the actress who played Sherry, she was sooo good in Search Party). 

Also wondering what they plan to do for season 4? It's just gonna be the same thing as every other season. I agree with the other person who said that this would be a great series finale with Joe in Paris continuing on with his life. We all know that he isn't gonna stop stalking/killing people and even if Marianne comes back somehow, I don't find her that interesting. All the loose ends seemed to be tied up in ep 10 so why even continue?
The most unrealistic show of all time.
In the words of the jesse from breaking bad “HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!!”
I liked Season 3, HOWEVER, it is by far my least favorite season. Too many loose-ends and unrealistic plot twists. The biggest one that got to me is, how did Matthew not realize that there was a camera angle directly across from the bakery driveway that would have solved the case several episodes beforehand? He was up day and night going over the camera footage, and not once did he think to check the camera across the street that we knew he had access to?
I just finished season 3. I’m not ok. I’m having withdrawals 😂 I feel emotionally invested now. I really liked love, I got annoyed when her and Dottie constantly brought up forty but man why’d she have to go.
It touched me >!when Love was looking for baby's name, then when she said: we are perfect for each other, i didn't want her to die, even better for me if she ran away with the kid!<

Marianne was  boring, yeah she work in a library, matches Joe's interest but that is it! nothing was really charming about her and she is a very sad person

Now Matthew the tach guy should have done more I believe, he was just to slow with the power he have

again >!gonna really miss love quinn, wanted her to be alive until last minute, dammit she was gasping that they were perfect couples. damm Joe! !<
Please I can’t be the only one who doesn’t like Love at all. I swear everyone’s obsessed with her but I hate her just as much as joe. If not more, she’s basically a predator. Legal or not her being 35 sleeping with a 19yr old who still lives at home is CREEPY
LOL at the police finding enough DNA evidence in two toes to identify and conclude Joe is dead in the house fire but never any DNA evidence to convict him of any of the murders. Our boy is running around willy nilly stabbing public figures bare handed and the police are like “must be a mugging, case closed.”
I got surprised by how many people felt like Love is the annoying one... Love never pretended that she's perfect or that her partner is perfect smh... I think she didn't have selfish motives behind wanting to keep him she just liked him for who he is, It felt so sad to me when she was trying so hard to make him love her and save marriage while he was just pretending and obsessinh over the other girl, they are both messy and garbage but Joe is the worst in my opinion.
I just wanted to say I JUST realized Ryan was Cappie from Greek 😂
Just did a rewatch and noticed how Beck said "What are you gonna do the next time we have a fight, torch the place?"  felt it was fitting all things considered.
I hate watching this with my fiancé haha. Makes mind think about bad shit
My wife and I just finished season 3 and I can’t believe the amount of drama and tension they managed to build over 10 episodes. >!When Love attacked Theo… that was heartbreaking.!< I didn’t expect to like him so much by the end. What a wild ride.
There’s too much sex in season 3. Idk it was just something I really noticed. 
I was even shocked when they had that episode of Love talking about her and Joe’s sex life being non existent . 

In my head I was like you two have sex like almost every episode but then I realised what Love meant was lack of connection. 

That being said there’s too much sex scenes in s3 and that whole couple swingers episode was weird as hell but I did get some laughs because of like delivery
Having sex right after they killed somebody and right in front of them, says how sick both of them are. I thought S3 got out of hand. Jesus christ they ste crazy as fuck. Wtf
this ia the worst show i ever saw (s3 ep8)
Loved it, I laughed more than was immersed because none of the main characters deserve any empathy. People who hate Love are missing the point. They’re both completely crazy and broken people who will never recover or be redeemed. It’s best appreciated from a distance. Just so happy that fewer innocent people died this season compared to others…
Is love really dead?
It seems I’m in the minority but I loved this season! I love seedy rich elite stuff though. So sort of seeing LA celebrity/influencer/wellness culture satirized really did it for me.
Theo was my favorite character this season, so happy he didn't die. My favorite characters last season were Will and Forty. First season was Elijah. I hated Love, she was so annoying and impulsive. I wonder if people like her more than Joe because she's extroverted. Her and Joe are actually very similar, they both have big hearts and are smart, Love is just more extroverted and people focused, while Joe is introverted and more focused on his daydreams.
honestly. Love ruined this season for me. The ending was so satisfying.
What is lifetime?
I totally fell for love's fake persona in season 2, but absolutely hated her guts through season 3. So I think they made what Joe felt very relatable. I wish the actress would remain in the show but I don't see how
I feel like Joe is misogynist..idk if anyone else thought that. 

The way he kinda just...objectifies women. Even the person who is his "you" gets objectified.. 

They seem less than people to him, more as a toy to throw away when disinterested.
Unpopular opinion but I thought season 3 was better than season 2. I was glad to see Love get her demise. She was an impulsive character who never failed to irritate me. Everything that happened in this season was because of her: Natalie’s death, Cary and Sherry finding out about it, assaulting Gil. She is a heartless person: tried to kill a teenage boy (Theo), and would’ve easily killed Marienne without a second thought had her daughter not interrupted. I’ve seen people who are mad that Joe killed Love, but I think it was necessary. Had Joe not killed Love, she would’ve easily killed him. I felt that she would’ve overstayed her welcome if she was included in season 4. I think the writers have done all that they can with the Love and Joe love story. If their romance was to continue on to season 4, it would be extremely repetitive and would most likely mirror season 3. I will admit that Love was a very interesting character who added a lot to the show but I think her time was up.
I'm not sure how I feel about the new season at all. I truly wished they kept Victoria's character. I do acknowledge that they can't go for so long with other stories lines too. I still think it would've been nice to have her in the show. 

Besides that, I think the storyline dragged on for a bit too long. In terms of the back and forth shit with their marriage and affairs. Also, I don't understand why they would make Love fall for a teenager, Theo. It's just so weird and uncreative to me.
The writers basically took S2 and copy-pasted it onto S3. It's just the same show but with different characters, except lesser people die this season. 

I hope S4 will have some sort of miracle crossover event with Emily In Paris. Otherwise, idk how the writers will elevate this show. The killing is getting repetive and there is nothing exciting about it.

I did like Sherry and Cary in S3, their characters were GOLDEN. So fucking annoying, yet PERFECT.
I really need this show to end with Joe getting killed or caught. If he gets any kind of happy ending I will hate it. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who watches this and actually wants to see the bad guy finally have to pay for all the fucked up shit he's done.
Joe's being obsessed with Marianne felt so rushed and fake. He worked with her for a while without really caring then suddenly gave her the stalker treatment? And Marianne liking him back also felt rushed. She seemed to think he was creepy at first. I guess she just forgot about him stalking Natalie????

I actually liked Theo and Love. Love seemed so desperate for love from Joe and when she wasn't getting it, caved and gave into Theo. I think that made sense.

Finally, who was the note left with Henry supposed to be from? Love?? If it's from Joe it makes no sense because that would mean he knew was going to be "murdered." Also did Dante ever mention wanting kids? He seemed happy with Henry but that's a huge risk to assume someone would keep your child.
I enjoyed it. I felt like Love had to go as soon as she killed Natalie and it was cemented when she killed Gil. She killed her ex husband and was growing drugs to use on her current husband. Good bye! The actress who plays her was great tho. But won't miss her character. I'm actually glad Theo's young and in lust self lived. Hope he learned from his mistakes. Marienne was OK. She kept straddling the fence on should I mess with a married man or not (the answer was not). Don't need her back again next season either.

Very curious how they are doing to do Season 4. I bet it's the last one. And doubt Joe makes it out alive. Wild guess.
How did Joe go from being obsessed with protecting Henry and being there for him always to leaving him behind?

Strangely in comparison to everyone found the first few episodes slow and the last few enthralling.

Also loved the chemistry between Love and Theo and couldn’t wait for them to get together
This show ruined Lion King for me
You guys see it's already renewed for season 4? I liked that ending. SPOILER OF END OF SEASON 3 AHEAD.



I'm happy that she is gone. She was impulsive, impractical. And just down right insane.
Everyone here is judging the season in terms of how it sets up season 4, when we haven't even seen it yet and there's a lot of room for the writers to go. As a standalone season, this one may have been the best. There is a twist right in the beginning with Natalie dying, and then the tension between Love and Joe leaves such drama and uncertainty about how it will all end and who will end up dying until the very end. Season 2 seemed like a rehash of season 1 until the end, but this one had new takes on the drama and moved the plot forward differently throughout. Best season yet.
I fucking hate Sherri so much can both these psychos kill her in the most gruesome way possible pls
You know the whole aconite wolfsbane thing was kinda dumb when you think about it. Joe did not react in his narration like someone who took adrenaline or saw this type of poisoning as a possibility. Even worse the only reason he was poisoned was cause he picked up that knife…which he didn’t need because he already had his own wolfsbane syringe in his pocket.
Did anyone else think the cinematography this season was absolutely shit? Like it seemed as though the entire season had been shot in portrait mode or something, cause almost all scenes had this intense focus on just one small part of the face (or sometimes just the face), while the rest of the frame was super blurry.
It was hard to watch.
Yeah massively disappointed by this season. Maybe I'm just tired of Joe but I wished it was from Love's perspective more and that she survived and started new for season 4. That would've been crazy. 

They also butchered her character. Like I thought she was a "ride or die" type of person but seeing her cheat and getting mad at Joe (before him and Marienne) was annoying. They absolutely ruined her character this season. Which is a shame, the actress is phenomenal. And her character was so compelling in season 2. 

Overall, it just didn't keep me on the edge of my seat or engaged like the previous two seasons. Shame, was really excited for it too. Fingers crossed Umbrella Academy S3 won't let me down, as that is the other one I've been excited for.
I think we can all agree Sherry and Grant are actual couple goals.

No I'm not being ironic at all. Like wtf they're actually really sweet together. 

Even the whole polyamory thing...they were so nice and sweet about it. Like I'm just saying, if they invited me to try I'm not sure I would have said no to them T.T
I hate the Maryanne character she is so boring, a woman waiting to be rescued. Loved the couple though Sherry and Cary SAVED the ending
was not a fan of this season

1.  too repetitive. I was hoping this would be centred around joe as a dad and when he finally realised he has mommy issues I was hoping he’d finally stop obsessing girl after girl.
2. Love is a hypocrite. she kept blaming joe for everything then goes around murdering (leaving joe to clean up) and hooking up w the next door teenage boy 
3. joe and Marianne had NO chemistry whatsoever
>!Joe is very much a bad person but holy shit Love May genuinely be worse!<
when joe started "you"-ing other women, my bf and i could not stop rolling our eyes to each other. i mean seriously. so predictable that i didnt even think theyd do it. feeling disappointed
They reallyyyy under developed Mariannes character, which makes me not excited for S4. 

Joe had chemistry with Beck, Love, and even Natalie. Absolutely none with Marianne. 

I liked her as an actress, but not her character.
I really don't like this season. Tati Gabrielle has one of the worst roles on the Sabrina Series and now here? Come on.
Why did Love have better chemistry with a teenager, than Joe had with anyone? I think I need go bleach my brain now.

Edit: he’s older than her in real life, phew, removing my brain from the bleach
I’m sorry, I have to say this… I hated Marienne. She just had this really smug and unlikable personality at first, and no matter how they wrote her, I couldn’t get over that first impression. Absolutely woeful character.
They want us to sympathize with Joe SO BAD, and YOU mostly fall for it (sorry, thought I should try that 🤣) but it will never happen with me! These shows introduce women who are just as bad as the man, so that you can pity the man/main character even more. Nope! No lie, I UNDERSTAND, NOT CONDONE, a lot of Joe’s killings… because in his mind, he’s doing what’s right. Also, he usually kills his hostages…. But Love just kills anyone in the same room as her lol. Joe even tried to explain that, however, he’s not the right messenger! And the women/other characters usually get into this shit BECAUSE of (or for) the man too… which Love spoke on, but she’s not the right messenger either lmao. Anyway, Sherry & Carey caught me off guard lol. I’m happy Theo is alive but I’m still pissed that 40 isn’t 🤣😭 And idk if this is the same audience from YouTube years ago but apparently everyone hated 40? 🤨 Fuck y’all, I miss 40 lol. And I hope Joe doesn’t find Marienne 😭🤞🏽 Shes my favorite character, then Theo, and Henry lol… all after 40 of course haha. But I really hope he’s caught and I don’t end up watching 4 seasons of this creep for nothing 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️😭😒🤞🏽🤞🏽 Another thing is that these ppl always kill themselves then write about it, I know it’s common and I know the victims are in different places.. but no one picks up on their writing style? Word choice? Nothing? It’s probably just because I love reading and writing but these are key details tho… I mean, Beck WAS a writer herself, her style should’ve been known. Gil was married for all those years, does his wife not know how he talks/writes, like things he’d say and wouldn’t???

PS, I’m super new to Reddit and idk what a flair is.. or much of anything on here for that matter.. 😕
Joe is a gigantic fucking hypocrite and started to annoy the shit out of me, I actively rooted for Love to kill Joe and Love getting arrested or SOMETHING. I was angry most of the time watching this season lmao
[deleted]
i absolutely hated this season and i find love so annoying.. it was almost painful to watch
I was rolling my eyes at how much the shows writers were hating on the setting and blaming it for turning the main characters crazy. The cringey "suburbia bad, city good" message makes it seem like it was written by an older millennial like Lena Dunham.

Don't like suburban living? Move back to your stinky overpriced city then.
I don’t like Joe as a character anymore. His storyline keeps repeating and he’s getting stale. I wish Love killed him and the show transitioned to her as the main character. She’s so much more interesting.
Love didn't deserve to be killed off. 
If s4 is gonna be about another girl who Joe's stalking , I'm not watching ugh
Someone need to call sherlock,bosch,ford and trench to love and joe regin of terror
I hate Cary and Shery so much. I am loving this season overall. Love is great and Joe is too. The problem is that they don't trust each other very. It's going to end very badly I think.
I thought diverging from the books was a good call for this season, then I watched it.

It was an ok, fun-ish watch, but the writing this season was all over the place. Not realistic, very random character arcs, strange plot holes, ... It was wild. Not very excited about season 4 at this point.
Just started watching and so far so good.
Was not a fan of this season at all teflon Joe
Super messy overall. While I did enjoy Loves storyline at the beginning, it started to become easily predictable in what was going to happen in the ending. I’ll probably watch the next season, but I won’t invest a whole day like I did today.
I thought the season was alright, everything seemed very predictable, season 1 + 2 had crazy endings but it seems joe was always gonna win out in the end anyways, I don’t know what I feel about season 4 if Netflix does make one
Binged watched the whole season and it honestly felt exhausting to watch. All the characters felt insufferable and excluding that twist in the first episode, everything following that just felt following a pattern.
At first I thought Natalie was going to fake her death because of the note that she read Gone Girl and the way her husband gave the speech of her missing way almost identical to what Ben Affleck's character said in Gone Girl. 

But then they just killed her and it was done.  

Also, if Natalie's husband was going crazy looking over the footage...how would he miss the other camera? And how come he wouldn't just zoom in a bit to see Joe's hairy arms instead of Natalie driving.

There were so many good twists but a lot of loopholes and a little bit of laziness with the writing. There's still questions from past seasons that never got addressed too.
Wasn’t Love pregnant or smtg. Hate to see her died like that…my favourite character in season 2😢
I thought season 3 was just so fun versus s2 and s1 which were a tad better than ok.  I don't know this time it was so off the rails that it was enjoyable for me
Did anyone else think Dante wasn't actually blind and was secretly an undercover cop or something? He was so nice compared to the rest of the lunatics, that I stayed paranoid about him.
I liked the beginning and I really liked the ending. The middle gets away from me a bit, I would to have like to see Joe and Mariannes relationship some where other than just the library. Maybe leaned more about her artsy stuff. Didn't really feel the obsession the same way I felt it for Beck/Love, or even Delilah. 

Overall I feel like the season lacks a bit of connective tissue, but gets tied up nicely with a bow by the end. Not as good as Season 2, but good enough to make me already want a Season 4.
>!Someone please explain why joe suddenly was able to move at the end ???? I am so confused because if he took the pills before then why didn’t he move when Maryanne was here only minutes before Love tried to kill him ? !<
Sadly Love did not use cyanide from peach to poison Joe. That would have been a beautiful way to connect the begining and the end of their story.
I didn’t hate this season, it was entertaining, nothing fantastic, not as good as the last one-gonna miss Love, she kept Joe on edge. I wonder if this show will ever end with him being jailed, or if they’ll change the formula (it needs to) for next season.
Joes mum >! Does she also have a pattern of leaving her children and starting anew over and over ?? !<
My thoughts on this season seem to be different from anyone else's. This was my favorite season & i thought Joe fucked it up & Love was in the right…. Maybe im actually crazy tho 🤣
I can’t believe I felt sympathetic towards Joe and Love and was literally scared the whole time they’d get caught of their crimes (makes me question my morals lol cos they rlly dont deserve to live in that suburb w the rest of the people… looming serial killers day and night)

What stood out to me the most was Joe could get so obsessive to the point that he could carry out a conversation and live in his present so much while killing/burying someone and act like nothing happened. Makes me think if murderers out there think that way too (kinda crazy)
Idk if it’s just me but this season didn’t keep me on the edge like the previous ones apart from love dying
I’m conclusion Love is a dirty bitch for letting that little boy fuck her on the ground of a park and the bitch is crazy. Only take aways from this season.
I hated how this shows started just completely making you root for these creeps, i really loved sherry and cary’s characters as in the end if gave me someone to be happy for. I really wanted the show to end this season with them being found out and hunted down…
After seeing Love kill somebody in the 1st episode , going on to kill multiple people after . I knew early on she wasn’t going to come out of that season alive . When you start to realize Joe didn’t want to be with her anymore mid season that all but confirmed for me , Love was already dead . Victoria Pedretti is a great actor and carried that entire season . Sad to see her go
"It was a bad moment a lifetime ago"

I cracked up when Joe said that
Okay so I've learned to not compare the books to the series because it is way off now but I get to enjoy the books and see how the Netflix show plays out. So far it's really good. I mean Joe met his soulmate his true soulmate love. He just can't face it because well she knows him but really KNOWS him lol love it!!
Here’s what i THOUGHT was gonna happen while watching. I thought joe would persuade Love to do polyamory earlier and that Love would have a relationship with Theo and Joe would have a relationship with Marianne. Then they would get jealous and kill each other’s new partners and then  rekindle I guess?
Dottie is funny as fuck.
I was really hoping they would get caught in the last episode ugh. Love needs to learn not to kill everyone who upsets her. It felt like someone was killed every 10 minutes. Love was really the one fucking everything up in this season, Joe was just her partner who cleaned everything up for her. 

Shows like this are hard because I grew attached to the main characters and wanted them to get away with everything, but also wanted them to get caught because killing is bad. Makes me feel very conflicted but at least it’s fiction.
Wasn’t Joe called “Will” in season 2 but is now going by his actual name in Season 3? Did I miss something??
I’m so glad Love is dead. It should have been her and not Natalie.
>Did anyone think about that they have Joe's DNA now because he cut off his toes? They found the jar of piss at Peach's place right?!<
I JUST WANTED LOVE TO KILL OFF JOE FOR GOOD 😭😭
Woah😄!! Season 3 was a rollercoaster of emotions.
I wrote a post after I binged S2 some time ago and irrevocably declared that S2 was so much better than S1 in all aspects.

But S3 was something else. Though it did get a bit slow after Gail's story was wrapped. But it was so exciting in Ep8 when Sherry scratched her arm which showed that she was lying, everything after that was Incredibly written. And when Joe was faking to be paralyzed and UNO reversed Love. That was freaking awesome 😂. 
"Did you really think I wouldn't notice what you were growing in the garden"🤣 
But It was sad to see Love's death. I'm usually unmoved by character's deaths but Victoria Pedretti is a hell of an actress. It's sad to see her go. Loved the way they worked together. Love would kill and Joe is expert in taking care of it afterwards. Match made in heaven.

As for the ending, People in this subreddit are Split. Some like it, some don't. 
I especially Liked the ending very much. Since Ep9 I was scared that they'd mess up the ending but it turned out to be quite good.

All in all, it was a great season. Hooked me from the start when Love killed Natalie. Must watch.
So everyone keeps saying Theo is in high school but was that said cause I assumed he was like 19 in college?
I hope Marianne takes him down. She was the last person to speak to Love (besides Joe) just moments before.
Ok so I just finished you season three and I have a lot to say. *Spoilers* First off giving Henry to the gay couple was the best choice joe ever made. Second is he still sending money to Ellie now that he is in Paris? And how the hell did loves body count over take joes this season I thought for sure he would kill a lot more people. Also loves dead so are we ever going to find out where love dumped Delilah’s body.
I read Ellie was going to make a comeback and was pretty disappointed I didn't see her. Joe should've went back to get her from wherever she went before he fled to Paris. He was already having issues sending her money and she isn't even mentioned after the third episode, where he didn't get the chance to send her any because Marienne caught him stealing the book and had to return it. She might think he's actually dead because it's probably in the news all across the country. Just flaked on both her AND his own son. Starting not to like Joe...
My son just turned 2. Joe and Love struggling with a newborn is TOO REAL. And every time I see Henry’s cute face and hear his cute noises along with his psychotic parents I become less sure I can finish this season. I need a spoiler: does anything bad happen to Henry? Is he gonna be okay?
I'm still confused why Joe had to >!bake his toes into a chicken pot pie !<
Just started Season 3 and I'm very curious to know - Do we get a Love voiceover episode? I remember there being a Beck voiceover in season one and an episode with Love's narration seems sorely needed.
This season is so good so far. The humor,the complexities, the mocking of joes continued misogyny. 
Victoria’s acting is out of this world
Is anyone else disturbed by the relationship between Love and Theo? Their relationship creeps me out.
WHY COULDNT JOE JUST BE GRATEFUL??? LOVE WAS HIS DOWN ASS BITCH
So no ones gonna acknowledge that LOVE is the one that ruins the season? The entire shit show starts because she kills a girl immediately. Ok joe cheated, SO U SLICE HER NECK OPEN WITH AN AXE??? I don’t see why everyone views joe as the un likable one when everything he does from this point on is done because of how radically unstable love is. Yea he’s an asshole and a creep but he just wants to be a good person and have a normal life , the reason he falls out of love with Love is because he realizes she is exactly what he is trying to NOT be. He falls in love with Marienne because she is someone who joe thinks he can have a normal life with , that’s all he wants.
YOU season 3 was like watching a boring game of ping pong. Does he want me?  Do I want her? Blah blah blah. Everything that made season  2 so great ( mainly the hilarity of it) was missing here. They had so much opportunity to make fun of the suburbs in the same way they made fun of LA, mainly with hilarious supporting actors, but instead of balancing the morbidity with fantastic moments of comedy gold ( see season 2) or intrigue (see season 1) it was just plain dull. Halfway through I found myself wishing Benson and Stabler would show up and solve the “mystery” of all those piled up bodies in one quick episode
What if Joe killed Love instead before she could’ve killed Natalie?

I love Victoria Pedretti but that would’ve been an interesting S3.

Not really a fan of how these new characters were underdeveloped, even the optimized couple.
Did we ever get clarity on what actually happened to loves ex husband?
See you all in two years!
Did we even need Marianne? The whole plot of their relationship seemed like a rinse and repeat. Any time she appeared on screen I was instantly bored. Remove her from the season and you would have the same plot. Joe was falling out of love with Love anyway because of all her murdering.

SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING INCLUDED

i still dont know if i like this season. love was very out of hand but the ending was pretty cool. SPOILER ENDING:


i was just confused of why joe gave away henry i would think he would keep him? and why burn the house down there is noway they would find loves body and the message on the laptop. also why didn’t theo snitch on joe and why didnt the 2 neighbors snitch on joe aswell? (their characters where so unintresting to me i didn’t even bother remembering their names) btw is love a pedo now? ffing a 19yo how is that okay? i loved love as a character but after this season shes meh. i felt like the series should’ve ended here.
Why is no-one talking about the blind man that works on the library? It's one of many things that don't make sense.

This season was awful. Very boring.
Spoiler alert. I finished season 3.


If they are seriously going to make a season 4 I sincerely hope they find a loophole to bring Love back. I didn't care for her character in this last season being that she was so damn impulsive. And just different.. But, if they really want the show to move forward they can't keep repeating the cycle. When Love was added in to the show it set a different dynamic. Even if season 4 is about her finishing Joe off for good, and them not resuming their love story, at least it'd be better than continuing the cycle over and over again. I wouldn't be surprised with how intelligent and cunning she was that she didn't also take adrenaline to counter act the possibility of Joe injecting her with the wolfsbane as well. She's smart. Who knows. Maybe she woke up while the house was burning and ran out the back door? I think that's the only way they could save the series. Where they go from there is a mystery but at least with Love in the mix they can create something worth while as a final season. I don't wish to see three more seasons of Joe obsessing and killing. I can't do it.
Really wish they did something else with the plot towards the middle and in the end part, as well as keeping Love alive. I felt like Joe and Love had a very good dynamic I was rooting for them to end up falling in love with each other and just admitting their both physcopaths who will just keep murdering together. I just hate the back and forth undecided if they want to be together or not.. Also hate the Theo character.. the actor played him well. But it was already a given Love needed a love interest since Joe always had one idk. I felt like they killed Natalie to fast it was getting so good in that first episode. I felt like more plot development could have happen leading up to her being killed. I agree with others the end was just rushed and boring. Season 1 and 2 is def my favorites. Season 3 was such a let down…
Love should've lived and Joe die. Would've been great for season 4, now it's same shit different day, and I just didn't feel connection between Joe and Marianne
Can't people ever be happy with their loved ones? Like ever? Goddamn, the lengths people go to make sure they stay safe without any repercussions is just totally wild. 

I know this show is fictional, but still, the part of being unhappy with the person you fell in love with is quite disturbing, and the aftermath is totally ugly.
I thought Cherry’s husband, Carey was going to rape Joe when they were alone in the woods during the boys camping trip. He kept saying all these things filled with deep sexual undertones lol

I wasn’t surprised when Carey revealed that they were in an open marriage and were interested in sleeping with them
Ffs ruined the ending of the show by accidentally clicking on a spoiler post 😡
The ending was weird and I it kinda reminded me of Dexter season 2 finale... so random. Liked the season tho, it was good until the very ending IMO 

Didn’t really like Marianne because this relationship felt a little bit boring, but I guess we’re gonna see her in the next season? I really don’t know what to expect
One thing that's kinda confusing to me is that is joe sociopath or a psychopath??? 

Well for me I think mostly sociopath because of his upbringing and stuff which is clearly shown in S3 

What do You'll think?
Season 3 was fun🔥 now I’m excited to see Joe in Paris next season.  Can someone explain why Joe baked one of his toes,  though ?? And was Love’s box of victim memorabilia supposed to survive the fire?
[removed]
This season was better than S2. The first 3 episodes or so felt like an entirely different show. We had the married killers desperately trying to keep things together, which was funny and fresh. Honestly the whole Joe stalking/killing thing got boring after S1. 

Too bad they went back to stalker stuff with Marianne, and now they killed off Love. Sigh...
I was so excited for this season but it was a bit of a letdown. I wasn’t as inclined to binge it like I had the first two seasons. I don’t feel it was as well written or well produced. There were a few cringeworthy moments in there, like when Natalie gasped and when Joe was having a heart to heart with his infant son. 

Even if Joe was falling out of love with Love, I feel like he would have also stalked her at least at one brief point in the show once he suspected something, because he’s all about that. Then, once he realized he was into Merienne because of mommy issues, you would think his newfound obsession would die out a bit, but it didn’t.
Yes because Joe not switching up his look even a little bit it believeable. Also i hate how they made him just a woman obsessed psycho with not even enough time to make the obsessions believable😭
Maybe I’m wrong but I think criticism of this season is a little harsh and premature. The show was limited in what can be done by the pandemic and anything is going to feel rushed if you binge it in 24 hours. I found this season to be highly entertaining from beginning to end, which is what it’s supposed to do imo. 

Victoria Pedretti was amazing and I’m sad to see her go but I think Love’s rapid downward spiral makes sense. She lost her brother, had a baby, got married, her parents got a divorce, she moved to a new town and clearly lost all of her friends from Los Angeles. That would make anyone act completely differently and go through a bit of a mental breakdown, let alone on top of the mental issues and skewed values she obviously already had. 

The problem with Joe’s POV is he’s horribly selfish and has no empathy for Love, so the audience has to overcome that to sympathise with characters he doesn’t like. Not that Love isn’t a deeply terrible person too, she is. The irony of this is they really are perfect together.

tldr; Victoria Pedretti talented and hot, so excited for Joe to go to jail or be murdered
Having watched up to episode 8… love had more self destructive tendencies compared to Joe and far more impulsive instances… granted both didn’t know the other was cheating, Joe tried his best at self restraint so many times … first with natalie then later on with Marianne until love pushed him to go on Cary backwoods trip that broke his wall.

Both Iove and Joe are clearly broken but penn for me acts so well that despite knowing he is a bad guy still makes me root for him.

Also I may be the minority that actually feels the chemistry with Joe and Marianne.. too individuals that have jaded pasts but are attracted to each other without high drama
okay now that i have finished the entire season i can say the following:

the first half of the season was really predictable. from the very first episode i knew joe was going to murder love. it gets boring watching them kill people then have everything easily cleaned up or explained away. knew marianne was going to be the love interest from their first meeting although i thought the show was going to satirize itself a little with their relationship since it was so formulaic/typical joe. he “falls in love” immediately, projects his ridiculous fantasies onto her, they have the cliche “making out in the rain” scene except it’s sprinklers, their relationship moves at warp speed to the point where it’s comical. marianne literally introduces her daughter to joe right away and joe seems confused as to why the kid isn’t siked to meet mom’s new fuck buddy.

i kept thinking “this is so ridiculous that the writers must be fucking with us and joe is going to realize his pattern of trying to be captain save a hoe” with mommy issues which he almost did until i realized “nope they’re just literally doing this same exact story over again with different barely developed supporting characters”. they live in a world where people are getting murdered all the time but there are also video cameras literally everywhere but as long as you put on a baseball hat that apparently doubles as an invisibility cloak you’re good. 

i will say i went from hating sherry and her husband and wanting to see them killed to wishing they would flip the script and kill love and joe to escape. it gets boring watching joe get to constantly escape every season especially to paris like you don’t need a passport or anything.  plus unless the show gets some fresh ideas it’s just going to be more of the same “joe falls in love by doing a bunch of crazy shit then realizes he’s with an actual human with their own needs and feelings, gets bored and eventually kills them. 

also, WHAT ABOUT ELLIE? she was briefly mentioned early on then quickly forgotten.
It was unrealistic how they got away with natalies murder.Any good police  could have checked the cctv footage infront of the bakery and figured out joe was the one that was driving.Also theo could have just rung the police when he found out cary and sherry in the cage.Also I hate how joe could get away with anything without any repurcussions.I hope he gets what he deserves by the end of the show.
i’m gonna miss love so much
Ending reminded me a lot of Dexter's ending that everyone hated: SPOILER ALERT (I cba using the white border thing)

Joe blames himself that he was gonna ruin Henry's life but he will be back for him one day.

Joe leaves Henry's with people he trusts and who wanted a child (the gay couple) 

Joe fakes his death and leaves to start a new life far away. But presumably continuing to find the right lady for him.

Dexter concludes that staying with Harrison would end him being harmed. He states that he is the problem 

Dexter leaves Harrison with Hannah trusting her to raise him

Dexter fakes his death and leaves his life behind, and stayed away

Both stories aren't complete yet but I respect the similarity, we know You took huge inspiration from Dexter, these two endings just show that.
I had to google why I was weirdly crushing on Marien’s  horrible ex - KAPPIE!!!
I'm sorry but this season was a little much.   The plot went from interesting "mind of a killer" show like "The Fall" into a total Soap Drama.

How is Joe still getting away with manipulating crime scenes like this and people believing it.  He's not Dexter!
So the whole ring thing was kind of dropped? EVERYONE wore one, remember? Are we meant to assume they handled them somehow offscreen? That would have been useful to see.
My main question now is how did Theo have the footage from the security camera of Joe driving and disposing of Natalie’s body and not use it against him even if he’s presumed dead?  It sounds like Love took the entire fall
I really couldn't stand Sherry and Cary at the beginning and I still don't like some of their individual traits, but as a couple they were like the total antithesis of Joe and Love. Definitely couple goals.
Very unhappy with this season. I used to love Love, but she turned from an extremely smart woman to one that is incredibly tacky, messy and dumb. Not sure how they did a complete turnaround on her character, she’s nothing like last season.

Watching the final episode now and if she makes it out alive, I won’t be watching season 4.
Can we talk about the classic book recommendations that the episodes revealed? Book lovers get in here
Can anyone clear up Joe and his mom scenes from all seasons? Did he take the fall for the guy he shot when he was little? I thought  him being taken from his mom meant she did so she should've been in jail or a mental hospital?
well rest in peace to !marianne! in s4
Okay, so I’ve never used reddit before and I’m on mobile, which i’ve learned makes it harder or impossible to tag spoilers. So i’m saying this now, if you haven’t finished or at least watched more than half of the new season, DO NOT READ beyond this point as i will be talking about SPOILERS!

Also this is probably gonna be pretty long, since no one i know watches this show and I’ve had so many feelings and analyses bottled up that more than one of them are def gonna bleed through. Im just hoping someone will read through this and hopefully we can all have a fun debate/conversation on our interpretations :)
 
Overall, my feelings for this season were pretty mixed. But everything I wanted to say seems like it’s already been covered in this thread so i want to talk about something i haven’t seen discussed fully yet:

The scene where Sherry and Cary discover the Quinn-Goldbergs had something to do with Natalie’s death. 

Now, i think the way they found out felt very stupid and forced in my opinion. And it seems a lot of other people feel that way. I understand Love was very unstable, and in a very dark place after losing her twin, possibly experiencing post-partem (idk how to spell that sorry) depression, and, y’know, even a psychopath has to be affected after taking so many lives. But it just feels so weird that Love decides to just…shout it out? Knowing their neighbor’s were in perfect hearing distance? 

Anyways, I rolled my eyes pretty hard at the set-up but can I just say I LOVED the climax. 

Violence is something that happens in abundance in this show, but from my memory (and please feel free to correct me if im wrong), we don’t see a lot of the victims fighting back. Besides Peach at the end of s1 and a little bit of Ryan mid season, Joe mostly gets the drop on the victim and has little to no trouble getting them exactly where he needs them to be. 

(Examples; Joe tricks benji into entering his dungeon of his own volition, then bashed him from behind. And even when he kills him, it’s through a spiked drink and the real violence comes from the deconstruction of his body. Not counting her real death, Joe stalked Peach and hit her from behind. And her true death is insinuated to just be a gunshot. With Hendy, he drugged him and then accidentally threw him down the stairs. Basically what I’m trying to say is, for the most part, Joe’s had it pretty easy when it comes to putting his victims down in a quick, efficient, and clean way without getting his hands too dirty.)

So getting to see a full on brawl between Cary and Joe felt very satisfying, and it felt good knowing Joe wasn’t going to just get out of this situation as easy as he always does. It really put all the “skills” he’d learned so far to the test, especially against a character who could’ve been physically capable of overpowering him. What had been his saving grace in committing his crimes was that he had always been unassuming, almost none of his victims were expecting him to do what he did and that’s how he always had the upper hand. But the Conrads knew what they were before they even had a plan, and watching Joe and Love unravel in a situation they had absolutely no control of just felt so needed.

And the tension. Oh my god.

I rewatched the scene where they first went upstairs more than once. I loved the focusing effect they did, fogging everything beyond the characters to give that illusion of adrenaline and tunnel vision. And even before the reveal, watching the Conrads pretend they know nothing while the Quinn-Goldbergs calculate their every move had me literally on the edge of my seat. 

   And it’s so gut wrenching watching the couple desperately keep up the ruse of swinging. It really made me sick to think what could’ve happened if they hadn’t noticed Sherry’s scratching. Would they have gone as far as seducing the killers in order to get out safe and sound? It was just the first time I truly felt anything for the Conrads, just pure empathy and sorrow at watching someone do whatever they think it takes to get home to their kids. 

And i loved how Sherry basically sacrificed herself in a way, telling her husband to make a run for it as he was the one more physically and logically capable of overpowering either of the killers and attempting to escape. It really made me look at her character in a new light, that she was willing to throw herself back deeper in the room and tell her husband to “Go.” I personally think if she was as selfish or shallow as I originally saw her as, she would’ve seen herself as the weak link and ran for safety as her husband fought off two attackers. But I think she really gave Cary a fighting chance by being the one to break the silence, as all of the attention was focused on her when Cary shoved Joe. 

The ensuing fight was truly entertaining. I feel like they really succeeded in building up the tension, and seeing Joe struggle to chase after and get an upper hand felt really fresh. 
     
    Usually we see Joe struggle socially or intellectually, like him rethinking his entire life after realizing that he has mommy issues, or failing to integrate into his obsessions circle to a point that he gets sloppy. But we rarely see him struggle when it comes to murder. I would almost say Peach wouldn’t count as a true struggle, as I’m pretty sure he had a concussion and was on heavy pain killers. If he had been fully physically fit, i believe Peach’s death would’v been as easy and efficient as the others had been for him.
   So yeah, seeing Cary full on body this man and put him in a headlock just felt very deserved (obviously lol). And all of this happening while Love is still trying to manipulate Sherry upstairs just really puts the cherry on the chaos cake for me. It just felt good seeing Joe be forced to get his hands really dirty, in a situation of his own making. He was the one who pushed for this whole swinging thing, and watching him lose his grip on the entire situation more and more was awesome. 

It was definitely one of my favorite sequences in the entire show, but in my opinion it’s only so good with the context of all of the previous victims. For me, a lot of season 3 fell flat or almost felt like a different show entirely. But this scene felt like a real, understandable de-evolution of everything they’d done until this point. They fucked up for real, and both had to do things even out of their own weird/dark moral codes and comfort zones. 

I’d really, really love to hear other people’s opinions on this scene since i didn’t see a lot of talk about it yet, which makes sense since the seasons only been out for a couples days lol. But yeah! That’s my take and i wanna hear other peoples too :)
>!Fuck love and fuck joe!<
The issue is, no other girls Joe is obsessed with are remotely as interesting as Love
Started off in New York, then Cali and soon Paris. My man’s taking this shit worldwide😂
spoilers: i thought they were gonna link joe's piss jar that he left at peach's house in the new season
I loved the beginning of this season, but toward the last few episodes I actually had a hard time getting through them.

I feel like Love and Joe were two different flavors of crazy. I’m sure they’d both be diagnosed as psychopaths and their deep rooted abandonment issues mirrored each other but I don’t know how to explain it. I feel like Ryan and Joe shared more of the same vibe (which gave me a few chuckles) moreso than Joe and Love. 

I lost a lot of that twisted empathy for Joe this season due to the fact that I wish his love interests were more developed/a slow burn. I understand it’s pretty much a beautiful woman in his vicinity but this season demonstrated in more than one way that he doesn’t care about being loved, he enjoys the hunt. I was not necessarily rooting for either him or Love- but the ending felt very “and it was all a dream” to me. 

>! I’m sad to see Love go. I liked their dynamic for the most part. I would have loved to see a split (not amicably) between the two of them and watch them do their own things, I would have liked to see a hunt for Joe as he hunts someone else. I also didn’t mind Theo that much. I thought he was sweet, maybe unimportant, but it was nice to see something mildly genuine. Didn’t care for Marienne, Sherry, or Cary I’m sorry. Loved how Dante ended up with Henry though due to him saying how hard he was trying to adopt while coaching Marienne. !< 

Despite enjoying this season though, I’m not sure I’m down for another. The tension and dynamic will be unmatched at this point and I wish they would have taken better advantage of it.
Why do people consider Love to be worse than Joe because she kills impulsively? Premeditated murder, which is what Joe does, is considered a worser crime in the US
Why does Joe never wear gloves? The guy is constantly leaving his DNA in places he’s broken into/crime scenes, also leaving his urine and jizz behind 😅
Ok, read the books, watched the show. Thank fucking god that the show made Love into a great character and further made her into what she is/was. 

I’m sad to see her go because she became the focal point of the show, during last season of course but also this season, eclipsed Joe as Joe became more efficient at killing and covering it up. 

I have not a clue as to how the show will continue, or if it even should. I just wish for a never ending season 3 now, I guess.
I thought it was funny they pulled Marcia Cross (Bree Van de Camp) from desperate housewives and then used the “cut off appendages to fake death and frame person for murder” plot line same as desperate housewives
Just finished with the boyfriend and we both sat there in disbelief. Once that wore off I was like “what now?!” Is it gonna be the same storyline with joe in season 4? It’s getting kinda old… I can’t see how this can continue without something new and fresh. I really liked the whole Bonnie and Clyde thing they had going on and tbh I’m gonna miss Love…. And sherry!!! She was so hated, but so funny by the end of it.
Although Love was obviously the PROBLEM of the show, i was honestly disappointed by what happened to her character. Taking her character off the way they did was too final and irreversible. BUT if the writers are creative enough, which I believe they are, they’ll find a way to write her back into the show (which i hope) because i feel like a good plot line for them is for Love to have escaped somehow, tracks Joe down, and it be a battle royale between the two crazies. That would be a GREAT extension to their arc, going from two lovers to two enemies fighting it out to the end.
Honestly, I’m glad we got a “happier ending.” 

Between thinking Cary had died, Theo was at best completely paralysed or at worst completely brain dead, and a thousand other just super bummer plot lines, I needed to know they’re all mostly okay.
This show keeps gettin' dumber and I'll never stop watching!
Scott speedman is so good and i wish he was in more shows like this
Where is the couple's therapistsupposedly from? Her name is Chandra which I believe is Indian but her accent and looks more Meditteranean specifically Italian and Greek.
When she said “he’s cheating on me” did anyone else at first think she was referring primarily to the fact that he killed someone and didn’t tell her, while the romantic affair was an issue secondary to that? I really got the impression she was more upset about the secretive murder she wasn’t involved in than the actual cheating
Having finished this season and with the ending where it is, just had a passing thought that it would be a laugh riot if in season 4 there is a cameo from Emily in Paris being both Netflix shows
Does anyone else not like how Theo and Love spend the whole season developing feelings for eachother, yet Joe and Marianne are thrown at us in the last 3-4 episodes and the way he's obsessing over her and pretty much ignores every thing he cared about with love (their baby, the cheating, what he said about wanting to stay as friends with her) i know the show was written with everything happening for a reason. I just think if youre going to have BOTH characters have an affair from eachother, make it equally as fleshed out and cared about on both sides. There was so much kick back from love/theo where the only chemistry he had was flirting with her and trying to get her to flirt back and when she responded negatively saying im married and never again etc, it doesnt make sense for her to have this reaction, then still defies everything she said in the nest few scenes with them. It doesnt even make sense that the show has Joe and love still going to work on their relationship with Sherry,Cary, they get outed again, then have to work as a team again, but its like youre not even rooting for them anymore because you just know that theyre both working towards a seperate end game. The ending shows you that Love still cared about joe and she only paralyzed him, rather than killing him, but he 100% kills her as soon as he gets free from it. Kind of really bummer as I love the anticipation building in the beginning of the season when they start going to therapy together and start to be happy again. It doesnt make sense for a married woman to ever wanna fuck a high schooler kid that looks 23 lol
Their baby just witnessed every after-killing-cleaning scene lol
Anyone else here were hoping that Joe would have outsmarted Love by giving her a fake key for the Room?  
So the couple would have truly despaired and gone insane? I don't know, I think a darker ending would have been amazing.   
Honestly, I think they should end it as is. No more Season 4. :)
>!The death faking was brilliant but would much loved it if Love was the one who did it and not Joe.!<
The best ending to the show would be Joe becoming obsessed with a new girl, but she knows who he is secretly and kills him in the end
I really am tired of this series. I only watched this season out of commitment to the first and second season and even then I was disappointed by the events of the second season and felt Joe should've been caught and locked up already. >!What bugs me more is that he went and found ANOTHER woman after Love kills Natalie and now his schtick is that he's searching for Marianne wanting to have this life with her. Honestly with how it ended, he can't have her. He can't have anyone. He's stuck in the delusion that he can have 'the one' and live happily ever after. I really wanted season 3 to be the end of it, and now I want season 4 to truly be the end of it.!< I am really tired of Joe. Rant over.
I hated this season. I only really like the last episode, everything else just felt too unrealistic. With a man who’s so great with technology, how was he unable to find any concrete evidence? And Love is crazy
Also, did the fact that they >!never wore gloves while stabbing/hanging/etc make anyone else uncomfortable? !<I know it's such a small detail but still 😩  I swore it would have caught up to them.
I really thought they were going to use Matthew as some weird serial killer/drug dealer/gang leader character, and that would be why he and Natalie were having problems, had security cameras all over the place, didn’t seem to “notice” his wife was missing right away, etc.
Really didn’t like that they killed of love.
I’m curious about the future of Joe at the end of the show. My first thought at the end of the season was “He always wins”. Love was psychotic and pretty smart herself, but Joe was always one step ahead. Will Marianne find Joe’s weakness and somehow cause the end of Joe? Or will the show end with Joe winning, despite being technically a villain that we are meant to root for. I’m not sure which one would be a more interesting ending.
I don't believe Love is dead, I came here to see everyone's theories and not one mention so far?
Crazy how this Youniverse completely eradicated covid
Hi, loved the season. So much potential. Just want to ask, I wrote something about it that might be considered mild spoilers and wanted to post it here. The title of it might have spoilers and I saw that's not allowed so didn't post it yet.
I actually liked the ending of this season and what happened to Quinn. It was a great way for her to go and for Joe to escape. I am hoping for Joe to die while getting caught in Season 4. I am weird. lol
Too much borrowing from Dexter.
\*Spoilers ahead\*  
>!I liked the season but disliked the ending. I'm not hyped for a season of Joe starting anew in a different country repeating the "stalk a girl-date her-kill her" cycle. At least, if they hadn't killed Love, or he had taken his baby, it would be an interesting twist.
Before watching the last episode this is what I thought was going to happen: Joe thinks that he got away with his plan, and even though he couldn't pick up Henry, he would go meet up with Marienne just to find that she was already killed by love. This would be a nice cliffhanger for S4.!<
okay hear me out..... >!i dont think love is dead!<
Anyone else think Joe's obsession with Marienne seemed a bit forced??? Like I know Joe is psychotic but I felt like he was actually shown to be quite stupid in this season idk. In all fairness I haven't watched the first two seasons in a while but like... this season just didn't hit those same notes for me. It was too obvious that Joe would survive at every point until that final fight scene with Love when I thought he might actually die.

In fact, I thought it would have been a good thing if he were killed by Love. Joe's ability to survive has gone too far now to be honest - it's unbelievable. He's not even shown to be careful. There's a point to be made about the implicit trust given to white men in society but I just feel like it's gone too far. 

I really think this should have been the last season with Joe and Love either getting killed and/or arrested. Like the first season had me rooting for Joe and the second season had me sort of indifferent to all of the characters. This season genuinely had me despising Joe (and Love to some extent). Like the idea that he was a funny interesting murderer surrounded by annoying fake "good" people worked in the first two seasons but the stereotype of the annoying baddie in this season was just so overawed by Joe's inability to be even slightly self-aware and his continued obsession with someone who it's unclear why he is so obsessed with. 

I thought the scene where Joe and the guys went to the forest was the high point of the series as it showed Joe an alternative more acceptable way to release his demons. But he took that theme and rather than growing went straight back into season 1 obsession. 

These are my thoughts having finished the series about 15 mins ago. Lmk if you agree or disagree and wish me luck that I finish the assignment which is due in 6 hours 🤣
At least VP's nostrils will get a rest from now on.
#spoiler

>!spoiler! I’m just very sad upset and angry that joe and love ended up turning on each other and as someone else I forget their name,
“I wolf(sbane) you”
My heart hurts man it was so so good and still is but the way it turned around made me sad !spoiler!<
Idk why but between episodes 4-7 I was so irritated watching both Joe & Love 😭 also Natalie had so much potential
My favorite parts of the season were what I’d call the “controlled insanity” parts. Like… they’re still psychotic murderers, but they’re trying to act normal. I really enjoyed that, and I wish the rest of the season had followed suit.
i think joe annoyed me a ton this season cause i just felt like him and love were good for each other but he was chasing someone else
I don't really know how to phrase this?
But i loved season 3 but i don't like Love
Like the way the story went and everything was very enjoyable but at the same time Love ruined the show for me haha the actress is really good tho
like how tf did he get to Pahrisssss
[deleted]
It was quite difficult to watch at times, but still hard to not keep continuing on to the next episode. I almost wish they released weekly so it would last a bit longer.
Why did joe run the risk of acting like he was paralyzed when love poisoned him? If Marianne didn’t bring her daughter she would’ve been dead?
How did joe get into France after faking his death? Did he use a fake passport lol
Well.. I really liked this season. I liked how they showed how Joe s mind worked and the pattern of his actions, I didn't find it redundant, I actually thought it was interesting especially seeing how he started to realise it was "mommy issues" but then denies it and says it's not a pattern, it's real this time.
I think Love was shown the other season from Joe s perspective when he thought she was perfect, helpless and the one. He does this to every woman, but no one is perfect and as soon as he realises that, he loses interest and the woman starts "showing" her negative traits. I suspected last season that she murdered her ex. 
I did think that she killed people with no reason and Joe was cleaning her mess, and the fact that they still weren't caught was a plot armour but hey for me it's not bad, it's an entertaining series, doesn't need to be ultra realistic.
If there will be a 4th season I will watch it, I am really curious where will they go with his story since I believe it won't be the same storyline, but ofc it's going to show his pattern since he obviously has issues.
Ugh I was rooting for love and joe, THEYRE PERFECT for eachother ! Love was trying so hard to make it work and joe was unsatisfied. How the hell is joe gonna find someone else that truly understands him for him and forgives his uncontrollable ability to kill for whoever ‘you’ is.
Joe, smart enough to get away with murder but not smart enough to realise he's doomed to repeat the same pattern over and over and over and over again.
My favorite part was when Joe saved  Theo and  took him to the hospital. The best part of the season to me was feeling like Joe had empathy and was healing his trauma, going through the healing process and trying to be a better man. Yea he still killed people but he had a conscience and you can see how much he's grown with him saving that kid like that. Other than that, I couldn't stand Love's character. She annoyed me the entire time. Season 3 was not great in comparison to 1 and 2, but it was entertaining still.

Love leaving the bakery with the front door open having two people locked in the basement is a bad writing at its best.
I have finally figured out the weird bereft feeling I've been having since binging YOU over the weekend. I can't lie to myself that I like Joe anymore. That illusion has been crushed by his selfishness. No, scratch that, by his self-awareness. For example, he mentions his need to obsess and stalk which he knows, if he does not indulge, will "explode". Joe behaved fairly appallingly all season. He became more of an everyday creep as his self-awareness became obvious and he allowed himself to stray, relinquishing any faux inner conflict entirely. I'm not certain I want to watch s 4 anymore.
[deleted]
I keep wondering if Loves mother will hunt down Joe because of the loss of both kids and her grandson.Well see how that goes…
Is it wrong that after finishing this season, I kinda want a relationship like Love and Joe?😂😂 I mean, they were kind of perfect for each other.
This 3rd season was really just Joe cleaning up Love's mess, there could have been something deeper to it but I didn't really feel it. Season 2 had so much genuine energy and chemistry between Love and Joe but I guess he stopped having any feelings towards her after she revealed herself to be the only person who could possibly accept him for who he is instead of being some blank slate for him to project on to. 

There could be an angle of Love being hurt by these men and her break down being a result of their actions. Joe hid his true self and desires from her so she was never able to make him happy even though she is the only one who accepted his true self. Theo was overly persistent and even though she was compliant with his advances it feels as though she was being taken advantage of. Her crimes like Gil and her ex husband make her seem unredeemable though. 

The Theo subplot was disgusting, made Love into such a hypocrite and made her really hard to support as a character. Joe didn't actually cheat by having sex with another woman until Love had already cheated with the 19 year old son of the woman she killed. Even though Joe was unaware of/didn't seem to care about her affair, it could have at least made more sense if she got mad at him for cheating without having done it herself first. 

I get that a sociopathic killer doesn't really develop mentally, that they have patterns, that it's an unreliable narrator, but it doesn't have to feel so formulaic. Joe always "loves" some boring lost girl and wants to protect some kid that the show doesn't bother to make you give a damn about compared to the romance plots. If the whole romance with Marienne wasn't intended to be some self-aware display of Joe's habit of only caring about a fictional ideal of a person(which Marienne kind of touches on with her "too good to be true" monologue which gives me hope) then she was honestly pointless and boring. Both Joe and Love's affairs were underwhelming at best. Hardly deserving of their climactic jilted face-off. 

In short, the actors carry this show scene by scene with great performances because on paper the writing could definitely be better. I still enjoyed the thrills of the season but I think season 4 NEEDS to actually shake things up or it's gonna become a joke.
Really feel like the ending to season three is comparable to the ended of dexter, really just a struggle to pull it all together at the last second
I’m so glad Quinn got killed, I’m sorry but she was too much for me. Just killing any and everyone!!
Binged it all yesterday. Mixed feelings for sure. I think the second season is one of the best seasons of TV, especially if you read the book and know how relatively linear and mundane it was, the writers for the show took that and made it into something really special. So high expectations were set but not met in S3.

Love's impulsive killing isn't suspenseful or interesting like Joe's, just acting on rage for shock value. Maybe if we could hear her thoughts like Joe it would be different. I agree with a lot of comments here that Love going on to be the protagonist or co-protaganist would be really interesting.

The Conrads were really well developed characters that went from unbearable to strangely likable, and certainly provide an example of "true love" in that they were flawed, had fights, and at times acted selfishly out of impulse but still had amazing communication/understanding/forgiveness and in the end were there for each other 100%. I think Sherry's line about having to choose a soul mate and work like hell everyday for the relationship is wise and real, which is a nice contrast to her very contrived influencer persona.

Some of the plot holes though are hard to reconcile: Matthew not looking at the camera pointing into the alleyway??? Matthew not seeing bodies being dragged in and out of cars, Joe's and Love's house, the bakery??? Police not searching the bakery when it was the last place she was seen??? No one questions how ALL of Joe's remains but two toes remained in tact after the house fire??? Matthew, despite being a tech billionaire, couldn't get access to Joe/Love's cellphones?? He would have instantly solved the case and clearly has the resources to do so. Also just really sloppy that they are texting about murders, not using burner phones/encrypted browsing for incriminating internet usage, that shit doesn't fly in 2021.

Marienne was not well developed, she wasn't in the season long enough to be. I think the message that she was conveying is important: a white man's experience is vastly different than a black females', and it's important to try and get some perspective outside your own. Joe never understood this, even when she's straight up saying Ryan's death could be easily pinned on her (because of the mad black woman stereotype and racist policing), it just goes right over his head. But overall she was a plot device to bring Joe/Love's relationship to an end, unfortunate because I thought the actor was great.

I do like how Joe was putting the pieces of his mental illness together. The ebb and flow of being "good" and being "bad", even though he now knows it's bad, is a realistic depiction of struggling with mental illness that I can relate to (just to clarify mine doesn't manifest in stalking and killing, just self-destructive things).

Overall I'd give it a 8/10. Definitely worth watching, not worth raving over like I did with S2. 

Hopefully S4 brings another new twist to the overall flow of the show, because the Joe finds his "You" and obsesses/kills over them is going to be fully played out if that's all it is.
Spoiler?* I guess if you haven’t seen it but I did NOT realize that love already knew Theo was a teenager. I thought she found out later on. I was legit shocked
At the end in the cafe I was expecting that to be Ellie walking through the door.
My wife and I thought having Natalie in a threesome with Joe and Love (being jealous) would have been a better way to off her halfway though the season. 

Didn’t see the twist coming.
Joe is not that cool.
“A bisexual man is a truly optimized man”
Idk. this whole season had me switching sides. The first few episodes I totally was on Love’s side, Joe was essentially cheating with the neighbor, and they had both killed to be together - not that it’s justified but we understood the Natalie killing from Love’s POV. Joe started drifted away from the marriage, but Love herself even said, “why am I so unhappy, Joe’s done nothing wrong” he hadn’t even begun to think about Marianne at that point. Or at least not obsessed. Then Love gets railed by some teenage neighbor because she’s unhappy with Joe, and up to this point, from her POV shown in the show, she’s the bad one for that. Then Joe really starts blowing her off and caring about Marianne, and Love cheats again which this time was a little more justified after Joe blew her off the night before. Love just wanted to Joe to want her again but he couldn’t even if he wanted to. I hated love for >! episode 4/5 whichever was the first one she slept with Theo,!< but i think that’s what the show directors wanted. Idk. was hard to really root for one of them consistently. Wish somehow Joe would’ve realized what Love had done, and killed Theo and rekindled the relationship with Love. Disappointing ending but now we wait for season4. hope y’all enjoyed the rambling
can we please discuss the exile track >!while love was being dragged all across the floor by joe!<? tnx
With the ending joe wrote a suicide note for love killed her with the injection dragged her body to the middle of the kitchen so shes been dead for at least 2 hours id say he had to cook that pie too for his toes how would she set the house on fire after being dead already.. and marriene saw love right before that all happened and knew joe killed her ex ryan so im confused on why she didnt report anything? Also sherry making love "savage" on her blog what did that even mean?
I thought Joe and Love working through their marriage was exciting to watch . At the same time I thought it was entertaining when they were enemies as well. It crazy to watch because Love knows how Joe thinks and it’s like he finally had a perfect matchup.

The writing was sorta lazy at times.. when Love immediately linked a bloody shirt to Joe murdering the news guy as if he hadn’t been handling dead bodies for the passed month. Believing that the shirt had new blood on it was just unrealistic.

Also the fact that Love went from dedicating everything to make things work with Joe to having a 2 minute conversation and now wanting to kill him. 

The whole Marienne obsession was kind of stupid too. What was the point of Joe getting over her and breaking the illusion to then getting re obsessed. The back and forth just got annoying after a while and made entire episodes a complete waste of time.

Love and Joe’s rivalry was just really entertaining to watch. Especially the final scene. In the end Joe outplayed her but it would’ve been cool to see more battles between them. The 4D Chess kinda reminded me of Light and L in death note.

This season just had too much going on at once to be as good as before. It made the whole dynamic with Guinevere seem like nothing lol
Episodes 1-8 were a chore. Episodes 9 & 10 were baller

Cary and Theo had awesome dialogue. Love's facial expressions were just as great

The rest is uh.... leaves a lot to be desired. Season 4 better be wild
This entire season felt like it was being ripped straight from Dexter.
I want Joe to get back with Marianne and have her be the one who catches him. She's my favorite character (besides Delilah from s2 and Karen from s1) so I at least want to see her this season and see her get a good ending.
I just can't be invested in marianne or any new love interest that Joe has because love was quite literally perfect for him, even love said it "we are perfect for eachother", and she said this as HE KILLED HER! She had character and I will look forward to season 4 but Victoria pedretti and love can't be topped and any other girl Joe chases will see pointless and boring to me . Amazing season though, it has been out for a week now and I'm still bamboozled (so much so I NEEDED to come on reddit and discuss it
I know they only showed it once, but are we supposed to believe that Love and Theo only had sex once? Asking because some of the words that were used kinda makes it sound like they messed around multiple times and
Just finished the season, anybody else feel sad?
That ending was fucking insane. What a wonderful season. Beautiful writing.
me as true crime enthusiast:
GLOVES?!
FINGERPRINTS?!?!
Even though Love and Joe had a toxic relationship  ,  I still enjoyed seeing them interact , with each other .   It sounds like season 4 will be set in Paris with Joe stalking Marianne and we all know that won't end well
Huge spoiler ahead

I am so sad that they offed Love I wish they had gone on the route where love thinks she killed Joe but he ends up surviving and we don't know till mid season 4. Now it feels like season 4 will be a repeat of season 1 and 2 and idk how I feel about it.
Love’s neurosis caused a lot of problems every time they get to an ok place. Like the Gil thing, than swinging with their friends and getting mad at him and screaming about killing Natalie. Also, they found the key she hid in a stupid box of sugar??? Who hides a key like that?????
the camping part was my favourite bit of this season
Did anyone else feel like the way they wrote Love and Joe's relationship was too all over the place and inconsistent? Like >!one minute they're fine and he loves her, and the next minute he says he doesn't love her. I thought the therapy storyline was interesting because they realized they were "the same" in a way, but it didn't last long. And then when the marienne thing happened I got bored because it was the same shit he did in season 1. !<
I have a theory that all the people left behind by Joe will come together to take him down.

Marianne, Paco, Ellie, Dottie, Matthew, Theo, Sherry, Cary. I know it's idealistic but fuck yeah I need this.
best season yet
I was hoping the show would handle the marriage/fatherhood aspect better than Dexter did. Sadly that wasn’t the case, instead of committing to it they shy away from it, kill Love and give the baby away for adoption. Really lame. I’m pretty much done with this show. The first season was great and then it just went downhill way too fast.
I just finished the season. Some thoughts:

1. How can they say it’s based of Hidden Bodies? I thought season 2 was loosely based on Hidden Bodies, and this would be based on You Love Me. The library and Marienne character with a daughter also made me think it was based on book 3. 

2. The season gave me teenage slasher film vibes, akin to the I Know What You Did Last Summer movies. It was a lot. I know the original show/book wasn’t realistic, but it has gotten so far out there it’s almost campy or comical if that makes sense.

3. Love might be crazier than Joe.

4. Scott Speedman is hot. I thought there would be more of a twist relating to his tracking of people via the rings, his videos, etc.

5. The box HAS to go.

6. Shari was a funny character - the writing was witty. 

7. I didn’t get the toe in the pie significance or what the point of that was. 

8. Marienne and Love both looked gorgeous and their acting was great. I wonder if Marienne will be in season 4.
fuck it i loved it. lots to say, but i had a good time and will leave it at that!
Anyone else think there is A LOT of monologue from Joe especially, but Love too… might as well have been a podcast
I just finished this like yesterday but I have soooo many thoughts

* I love the way this show makes me hate almost all of the side characters right up until the moment Joe (or Love) is about to do something horrible to them. Then I'm like "Wait, no, wait stop I like them more than I realized-". Seriously Cary and Sherry were the WORST but I cheered when they found that key.

* I think my prevailing sentiment for this season can be summed up with "god*damn* it, Love!" because every time it seemed like they were out of the woods she pulled them back down.The first two seasons were a lot of Joe creating his own problems for himself, so it was interesting to see this dynamic for him.

* I wish we got to see more of Dante (and his boyfriend). More of all of the side characters really, they all felt super underdeveloped compared to the supporting casts of season 1 and 2.

* I was really curious to see how they would handle the kid... turns out they handled the kid by barely having him factor in at all, really. I almost wish there was a bigger time jump between seasons 2 and 3, because there's not really a lot you can do with a baby... its a baby. It basically either existed like an accessory or was with a babysitter the whole season, then completely dumped at the end. I guess it's at least super on brand for Joe to obsess over having a baby girl and then check out when ~~s~~he isn't what he expected.

* I could use fewer sex scenes. Maybe it's just me because I binged this whole thing in one afternoon/night, but like half way through the season I was getting exhausted just watching them.

* I did love the entire dynamic between Joe and Love. I actually wish we got to see more of Love's perspective. That episode with her narrating and Forty reappearing had me in tears. I would have totally watched Season 4 if it was just all Love.

Overall I think Season 1 is still my favorite, but I did like this season a lot. I'll have to re-watch it to see how it holds up now that I know how everything resolves and the tension isn't distracting me. I'm excited for season 4, but I am wondering if they're going to need to start wrapping this show up very soon. I mean, I think season 3 did a good job of keeping things fresh, but it's going to get stale or stupid eventually.
At the moment im on e8 and im liking this season less and less as its going forward.
I'm so upset he killed Love. I would have much preferred it from her perspective in the next season. Getting sick of Joe's shit over and over.
I had mixed feelings for like 2-3 episodes, but overall I really like it. It was way different than s01 and s02, focused more on Joe vs Love than Joe and a new crush.
Erm DOES ANYONE ELSE WATCH IT AND FEEL ALMOST *ANXIOUS* AT THEM POSSIBLY BEING CAUGHT….
Season 3 is aids after like the third episode.
Cary and Dante the real heroes of this season
Is anybody disappointed with the ending of Season 3?
Particularly around Love's death.

It feels too "haha I predicted you so I win" kind of moment right at the end when Joe kills Love.
I think it would've been more dramatic to have had Love live in some way, either for revenge, to screw over her mother some more or to still play with Joe on some level. There's just something so endearing about Love's character and I'm sad I won't get to see more, especially because it feels like her arc isn't complete. It feels like they just dropped her at the height of her intensity because they needed the season to end.
SPOILER Wow just finished season 3. I found it super fascinating that when Love was dying one of the last thing she said was that they were perfect for each other. I felt that. They truly were. Not only were they both planning to kill each other that night, they both let their spouses love interests live (which is a first?), they both were murdering people long before they met, they both have mommy issues and they both really really imagine themselves wanting to live normal lives (but can’t even if they tried). However I would not be surprised if somehow Love was still alive. I would find it thrilling if season 4 started with Joe having another love interest to fill the time of finding Marienne or even actually finding Marienne and that person/Marienne tragically being murdered (maybe even simultaneously while Joe is creeping on them) by none other than 3rd degree burned Love. I would also be ok with it not renewing because I think that ending didn’t leave me too much on a cliff. Idk all I know is I will watch anything Victoria Pedretti is in - she slays it.
I was really expecting to see Ellie this season...
Henry is FUCKED. He’s definitely gonna be a serial killer when he grows up, he’s got the genes on both sides. Unless it cancels out 🗿
I hoped they would lean into the bisexual more, might be the only way Joe could find a healthy relationship and season 4 is him deciding between obsession and love
Was Love pregnant at the end when she was looking at girls names and said Julia Quinn-Goldberg? Anyone else catch that?? If she was planning on changing her name why not change your last name if the concern is people recognizing you??
Damn did anyone else find the finale ending really sad? Why did they have to play “Exile”, it was so moving. They really made us feel sympathetic towards Joe, Love, and Henry in the end. Really tugged on my heartstrings with the concept of sacrifice and family.
One thing left unsaid: Joe didn't match Natalie's normal texting style with her sister. Natalie usually used full lowercase and no punctuation with her sister, but Joe used correct capitalization and punctuation. He made sure to mention it regarding texting Matthew, but not her sister. I'm surprised this never came to a head later on, so this is another thing to add to the list of loose ends.
His new name is nick. IM GONNA PUKE
Wait so did sherry and cary reveal the truth about joe and love?? They mentioned something about it in passing but if so joe’s gotta be significantly more careful now I would think, even in a foreign country and dead to the world
Marianne kicking over her bottle of Jameson and the liquor in the bottle being clear…
My heart was racing all of the last 2 episodes. I have not had a show do that to me in forever.
As a parent, this season had far less sweatpants, tied up buns, and skipped days without a shower than what's realistic for new parents.

Love should have looked like she did super hungover for the whole season.
Can anyone explain why, if Joe had already taken an antidote for the aconite, he couldn’t talk to matthew?? I don’t understand if i’m missing something
I was really sad when theo "died" and i would like to know if anyone else really liked theo?
still dont get why joe cut his toes of??
This season was a little boring at times
Much preferred this season to season 2.

In season 2 the supporting cast just seemed very shallow, and they certainly didn't get the best out of Victoria Pedretti... I just found it boring. 

Season 3 was make or break for me, and I will definitely be back for Season 4!
Love's fights with her mom were so triggering to me.  My mom is also an abusive narcissistic alcoholic/addict with severe emotion regulation problems who immaturely hits below the belt during her episodes of berating her children, but she keeps a line on us by "helping" us financially if we need it and then holds it over us for the rest of our lives. She was also good at hiding it like Loves mom (family had money and successful careers) until she got too deep into her addiction/divorce/etc, as she lost everything,  then we started to see her really crack which set up Love's true issues with her family past just the divorce and her parents being super weird. 

I like that we saw more of the relationship between Love and her Mom because it explains a lot more why Love is the way she is.  She just didn't work through her mommy issues and didn't set boundaries with her mom (who, like my mom,  has NO respect for boundaries, talking about her sex life with her daughter,  showing up whenever she wants,  and becoming volatile when boundaries are set) until >!her mom endangered her Baby.!<

Raise your hand if you were raised by an abusive narcissist (without the becoming a murderer part) 😂🖐😭🖐😬🖐
Cary and Sherry are top tier characters I swear they nailed the cage moments.
I'm sad that love is gone, I really liked her...
For some reason since the end of 2nd season I really hoped they'll just settle together and have cute happy family, but sadly that couldn't be the case I quess :(
I wasn't surprised at all by the ending tbh, though it was an emotional rollercoaster. Ever since Gil's death I was thinking "okay so how is Joe gonna wrap up this season by framing Love for everything" lol
Is no one going to talk about the attempted foursome though? 

Also, I love how everything ended - I feel like Joe really put in some care there. And Loves emotional switch is so fun to watch - one second she’s sweet and human then next she’s like “here’s the gun who’s going to kill the other first. Bye”
theo was extremely immature but i also felt very bad for him. i knew as soon as love thought he was dead that he wasn’t. a lot of the things were predictable and i became very attached yet un-attached to love’s character. the end made me cry & i don’t even know why or what for. the whole thing was truly an emotional roller coaster.
i love that they incorporated a relationship that was open ESP with sherry & cary. also when loved screamed what she screamed in the living room - my jaw fell so far to the ground. the transition of them trying this open relationship to them being in the cage. golden.
also if they were going to make love just as crazy as joe they should’ve put more growth with the two of them instead of putting the focus on a new interest joe has. wasted potential.
Im genuinely confused?? Did we ever find out how love disposed of the bodies form season 2?? I remember joe asking this season and she replied with that it was better if he didn’t know. I thought it would’ve been a plot point at some point but that never happened, and with love dead I feel like it would be unimportant now.
What I don't understand is how the neighbor has access to so many cameras, but there doesn't seem to be cameras ANYWHERE in this town that anyone is monitoring. How did they not get caught? I mean, every other house besides the neighbors and even the parking garage had zero. It seemed like there were NEVER any people around when they're dragging bodies through the alley, and their house windows were ALWAYS open, but no one saw anything? Joe is cleaning up broken glass and blood in broad daylight with the curtains wide open.
This season ruined the show for me. I was shipping joe and love. Then this season ruined both of them for me by turning both of them into toxic cheaters.
How does Joe get to Paris?? How do you fly there when dead?  Idk im buggin,....
I haven’t been strolling the threads but unpopular opinion possibly: Sherry and Cary were my favorites this season. I get that Love and Joe were supposed to be like overly toxic and emotional but after like episode 6 or so it got annoying the way they were going after literally everyone but each other. I’m so glad Sherry and Cary made it out in the end. Also where is Joe’s money coming from?? How does he afford to move so frequently and to these highly expensive cities and start life completely over ?? While repairing old books on occasion ??
There were some fun moments this season, but it's gotten a little too repetitive for me. There's going to be a new season but can we get a little less formulaic? Time to stretch those creative juices. I hated the Theo storyline and a lot of the "mishaps" that started to happen after episode 6 were incredibly predictable.
My wife told me the show's format was changed to a dual lead because many viewers felt Joe was being presented as too likeable, can anyone verify this? I'm asking because as a fan of true crime the "serial killer living undetected among us" is a sadly recurring theme. I assumed this was the point of how Joe was presented, we got to see how others and even Joe himself buy into the Good Guy masquerade as opposed to the stereotypical Hollywood style bad guy.
I don’t know why….but…I almost feel *bad* that Love is dead? 

Anyway, here’s my hot take: Love actually isn’t dead and will hunt Joe down in Paris. Rule #1: if you don’t visually see the character dead, they aren’t
Can someone explain to me how >!Joe didnt get caught for killing Ryan? Wouldn't his finger prints be all over him?!<
The swinging scene was hilarious
did the last scene showing >!joe strolling through the streets of paris!< while the credits roll remind anyone else of hannibal lecter strolling through the streets of bimini at the end of silence of the lambs?
i was 100% convinced that matthew was going to hack into the baby cam joe and love had set up in the cage
3 seasons and Netflix still refuses to call this show a dark comedy/thriller. It's an absolute gem and it's made me laugh more than What We Do In The Shadows.
Everything Love did for Joe was for him, everything Joe did was either for himself or Marianne it seemed.
I loved watching the show but I'm not sure I liked it (Ok, maybe I did). So many things were laughable I can't believe they were approved: >!Love killing everyone for no reason, people dying when they shouldn't have (or not dying when they should have), Love falling in love with the teenage neighbor... !<But I actually liked Love and I think >! it was a mistake to kill her!<  \- she's an interesting character and Marienne is so boring. And>!Paris!< at the end of the season was so fake! I can tell next season will be hillarious if Joe stays there for a while (grumpy parisian here)...Unless they get the budget to >!film in the real Paris!<
I found the series less good than the other ones but that might be just because the end was depressing. I wonder if its partly because this was the conclusion of a story while series 2 was merely the middle of the series. I really liked some of the early series 3 stuff.

In the end I felt sad about it because I was kind of rooting for Love and Joe to work out and I liked Love as a character - maybe it was just the first impression which was so full of life, asking about the ass/peach- but it became increasingly untenable. 

Glad Dante and Lansing got a baby.   


I'd like Joe to get a real comeuppance now, but I'm not sure how it will happen. I think Love was his truest and purest rival so I'm not sure what would ruin him at this point.
I wonder if Joe has ever tried to visit his mom as an adult.
it angers me to my core that joe finally finds someone who loves him for who he is and will kill for him >!and he turns around and kills her and searches for someone new!<
i am 2 weeks late to the party but I'M BACK FOR JOE BACK ON HIS BULLSHIT
I found it refreshing that they always kind of explained who was watching Henry whether it was Grandma, baby sitter etc.  I feel like no other shows take the time to do this and it’s so unrealistic (I think of dexter).   Kids are so much  constant work lol

Source: dad of a 1.5 year old 😂
HOW DID JOE GET TO PARIS THOUGH
This show is starting to turn into Dexter.
Anyone else get Dexter feels?  Fakes death, unloads son, moves somewhere new.
I didn't think I was gonna enjoy this season because for me the 3rd season of netflix original series is usually where the show gets extremely boring and self-replicating. But S03 of YOU was perfect! I actually liked this season more than the first two ones. 

I obviously loved the perfect sociopath couple not having patience to not kill anyone for more than 3 seconds. I like both Love and Joe as characters but I do not really care for them having happily ever after(cuz you know they are both psycopathic murderers), so it was just fun to watch them skrewing each other's lives in the worst possible way. At some point I was actually cheering for the two 'yeah you guys keep doing your things and maybe kill each other' 

Weirdly, it was the side story of Theo and Matthew that I was more emotionally invested.
When Theo was first introduced to the show I didn't understand why he had to be Matthew's 'stepson' from his previous marriage. Why so complicated. He could just be a son from Matthew's previous marriage, right? 

It was in the very end of the season when I came to sort of understand what they were trying to do by setting Theo as a stepson. So he's not Matthew's blood related child and his mother is no longer married to Matthew. There's not really much to define them as a father and a son. 
But in the end it's Joe who abandons his real son and persuading himself that this is best for Henry. Matthew is not exactly a good father nor was a good husband but he tries to learn from his mistakes at the ending. 

Honestly I was so glad Theo made it alive from that basement even though some part of me still thinks it makes no sense he survived that fall.
What bothered me the most was Marienne’s French accent. She literally couldn’t have sounded more American.
Anyone notice how Love is the physical manifestation of Joe’s issues? Joe (just your average Joe nothing to see here) and Love -all issues Joe has just more untamed? Thought it was nice symbolism in the show especially between Joe’s past with Fiona and his mum

I think the fourth season could see Joe’s brother.
Ending was convoluted

Matthew had been obsessing over the footage and never thought to look at the camera across from the street?

Joe and Love basically one upping each other by planning for each other's demise (key inside the cage, the poison, the knife, etc.). It just felt like so many things had to happen perfectly for all of that to play out. Then Joe's able to move to France without a trace and his body is never found, but presumed dead anyway because of the toes?

On top of it, the Conrads get out, but they decide not to go to the cops?

Just felt like they had to over explain and do the ending.
Holy crap what a whirlwind ending. Really kept us engaged. I usually get tired of TV shows after 2 or 3 season but holy moly. Also love the cool details you guys are catching.
Can some explain why Matthew was so sus of Love but just kind of medium sus of Joe? I didn’t really get what he was seeing on the surveillance cam that concerned him, and I also don’t really feel like they gave a good explanation of why Gil’s murder suicide was not to plausible to him. I really might have missed something though.
I was really hoping Ellie would make a comeback. I'm wondering if Season 4 will have her and she'll turn Joe in or end up being the "hero" of the entire series. I'm happy Henry ended up with his new family, I really liked Dante's character.

Matthew was really interesting, too. I found myself missing the S2 characters, though, particularly Forty. Love was so dark in this season and I loved seeing that side of her. 

Also, I just watched this entire series in a week haha.
I just finished S3 and per usual it delivered all the anxiety, stress, and heartbreak as the previous 2. I loved Love but she had to go and I’m interested to see what Joe’s next move is in Paris. I have to assume S4 will be the final season based off Penn’s hate for the character, Netflix’s obsession with ending shows between 3-5 seasons and simply a storyline that could get stale. 

All that said I think this season was the best one yet.
Anyone else think Sherry was shot in the ear because she only listened to herself, and Cary was shot in the leg because he didn’t have a leg to stand on without Sherry?
I know we're supposed to blame his Joe's mom >!as the catalyst for his craziness but I started wondering if she realised he was already a little monster and the murder was her chance to legally dump him and run away. !<
openly wept during the bathtub scene 💔
"You shot me in the ear!" Im sorry but I laughed hard while watching this scene.
Doesn't Joe know having a baby is a chick magnet?  Lost opportunity.
Is anyone else pissed off that there was 0 police interest in Love and Joe whatsoever? So unrealistic how they constantly got away with so many murders.
The comment by Sherry in the cage before finding the key “the weak spot is they don’t trust each other” makes me think she isnt dead or had a “dead man’s switch” up her sleeve
I want to say that I like the actor who played Theo. He did a really good job making me hate him because he was so annoying and corny. I actually wanted him dead but then when he was talking to Joe in the end, i was like "wait a sec, I should be feeling bad for him."
I don’t think we’ve seen the last of Matthew and Theo. They really emphasized when Theo copied all those files onto the flash drive. He still has the footage of Natalie coming to the bakery and not leaving and of Joe leaving in her car. I think when Theo recovers he will tell his dad what he saw. Theo already thought Joe was abusive to Love so he would definitely be thinking that Joe was the one who killed Love.
I just finished binge watching everything over the span of a few days, and Love’s actor and character had me saying “this crazy ass-” so many times.
**Is Love's "pregnancy" a Chekhov's gun we're missing?**

The writers spent a lot of time this season speculating that Love was/would become pregnant:

1. for a long run after she got it on with Theo
2. right before the roast chicken shenanigans went down

The writers also made a huge point about them being excited to have a girl:

1. when Love felt she was pregnant with a girl (end of season 2)
2. when Henry turned out to be a boy and Joe was hella disappointed (beginning of season 3)
3. Love looking up girls' names (end of season 3)

I think there is a chance Love survived somehow and that she is pregnant with their daughter.  
It makes for a potential "coming back from the dead"-story for Love which would be much different to Candace's story. Joe would have a huge interest in being a father to his daughter.
Better than season 2 but they really need to end it at four. It’s already approached Dexter territory and frankly think it’s due an end.
How did Joe make it to Paris? Doesn’t that ruin his whole plan of being dead? Like won’t the police look into his activity?
For a show that aims to be hyper realistic and covers all its tracks many questions remain:

1) how did Joe get to Paris? Its incredibly difficult to travel during covid let alone travel with a fake passport 

2) how did the police not check all the cameras around town during the murder sprees?

3) how did the bakery get rented, equipment bought, fully prepared and stagged in a few days after it was acquired?

4) what did love see in Theo? A sexy young woman would never go for an unattractive teenage nerd, that part never made sense.
if natalies husband was reviewing the tapes so much wouldht he have seen joe enter the bakery and never coming out?
I felt this season depicted Addiction really well. Talking about the phenomenon of craving and mental obsession, and how addictions can be transferred. And on reflection I would say Joe suffers from a love addiction (obviously compared to real life his is depicted in a completely dramatic/over the top/unrealistic way) - but in terms of the chasing the thrill of a new love that will never work, and when that runs it’s course quickly seeking another, seeking validation from another, codependence etc etc. Sorry I’m blabbering a bit now. Just felt on the whole the script was awesome. Big cudos to the writers for this 🙏🏼
I'm sorry, but am I the only person who thought season 3 was really, really bad? Bc looking at comments, and ratings, it is being pretty well received but I dunno, that was one giant cluster fuck. Would love to hear others' thoughts.
In episode 10 I’m confused about something.

Didn’t Love use the knife that has wolfsbane on it to cut the chicken?

So wouldn’t she have been paralyzed too?

Or did she do the immunity thing like Joe did?
[deleted]
I really liked that they called them Sherry and Carey, like sharing is caring. A little hint and nod from the writers is what I like
Cary’s face when him and Sherry were trying to act casual after hearing love’s confession 😂
The finale was wack tbh. I mean, framing Love?
So glad neghbor boi is ok. He was a shameless flirt but the kid was alright
The fact that library ladies ex husband was already dosing his own fitness shakes got a huge pop from me
I wasn’t a fan of the anti-vaxxer subplot. It just seemed forced in my opinion. (Obligatory,I support everyone getting vaccinated),but for a show that doesn’t really do anything topical,it seemed unnecessary and just a way to push an agenda.
Fuck suicide warnings spoling shit
Joe has 0 character progression feel like it would be better if Love kill him, cause what story are you gonna tell next if he is literally still the same guy from season 1.
Theo sucks. I hate him.
Just finished season 3 today. Such a good show. Any Idea when Season 4 will release?
Anyone else really irritated by the omission of how the bakery lease got to the office if Natalie died there (I guess Love could've sent it through herself from Natalie's email but just felt unfinished).   


Also it drove me mad that Cary & Sherry stayed in the box for so long without looking in anything! Surely you'd check for a tool or weapon even if you didn't think there'd be a key..  


Another frustration is why Marienne let her daughter in to use the toilet, if it were my kid I'd have rushed her to the car and let her use a bush when we're away from the house where I know at least 1 murderer lives!  


I'm sad Love is gone, I actually preferred her character to Joe but the format doesn't allow for her to take over his role I guess.
I finally watched the season and I like it. Heartbreaking and scary, but I was entertained. I hope season 4 is as interesting and Henry doesn't kill Joe in the end :)
[removed]
Might be wrong but joe never killed “For” love did he?? Like he killed Jasper to save himself Henderson to save Ellie and Ryan for Marianne
Loose ends

Personally I see loves character as dead and not returning however I am left with a few loose ends that either were left intentionally

1. Why did love NOT want joe to check on henry, she was rather insistent about it
2. Why did love not tell joe what she did with Candance or Delilah bodies, and why mention it? in season 3 were supposed to believe she cant handle getting rid of bodies, but in season 2 she deals with two all by herself
3. Lack of loves father at all in season 3, literally dude never even visits his grandson onetime, or checks out his son-law? strange, maybe because he knows what joe is
4. Love leaves the house for an errand, joes on the floor parallelized and she's delivering cup cakes....what if she went into joes car and found the "meds" he took? maybe took a few herself....
5. I understand joe needed to burn the house down to hide the real way love died, but that leaves for loves body to never truly be identified...
6. Matthew had his suspicions confirmed and walked away never looked back

It wouldn't be too far fetched to bring her back, the shows already deviated from the books in major ways, fans love their love, and in this era love taking over after killing joe would give the show an extra season or two, although id miss their chemistry perhaps as a enemies who know too much about each other in constant state of conflict, add in another pregnancy this time a "girl". many fans are not looking forward to a repeat of season 1
Just finished Season 3; it was so great! Penn and Victoria’s chemistry is incredible!

2 thoughts: >!1. There’s no way Matthew Engler missed that other camera angle that Theo found. 2. I’m really bummed to see Love go. I wish we could have one more season in Madre Linda with the same dynamic. But given how well the events played out, I know that’s not possible!<
So many Joe's obsessions now. Glad he's going towards diversity. Season 5: Joe stalking a hot french guy.
Does it bother anyone else how shitty Joe is as far as being a husband? He really has no idea how to commit to someone. Him and love neither one have any business being married, they don't have what it takes. They lose it and cheat and fuck everything up as soon as things get a little hard. But something about how easily Joe flaked really bothered me. At least love tried to make things work. He was looking for any opportunity to abandon his wife and son (well technically just his wife since I guess he intended on taking Henry) and that really bothered me. I just really looked at him as more of a man than what he proved to be in season 3. I was so disappointed with him. And the whole season really just did not do the institution of marriage any justice. Like they shouldn't have had them even get married, they didn't treat their relationship as if they were married at all.

Edit: grammar and clarity
I really didn't like Season 3, I felt in a way it made Season 2 completely pointless. How dare you get us onboard with the Joe/Love dynamic and then kind of turn it around on us. Make us feel like Joe isn't really a monster or Love is too extreme for him, when in all actuality she is the only one who would ever understand him or be that perfect mate for him, but immediately he's off trying to bang the neighbor and later his boss. I'm sorry but I can't really buy into his love for someone else. Not saying Love wasn't a monster but they tried to make Joe seem like a saint. Really none of the events of this season would have been put in motion if Joe wasn't constantly trying to find someone else to love, and would have just put all that effort into his family. I was never on board with Joe and Marianne. The finale of 3 seems promising for Season 4 but this season didn't do it for me, watching it felt like a chore IMO.
I just loved the fact that they started swearing like normal humans in session 3.
The ending of this season made me uncomfortable.  Foot wise anyway.
Finished watching season 3 last night. So glad Love is gone…
I personally really enjoy the "gets obsessed with a woman; seduces her; she becomes mundane so she must go" formula. This could be the formula for each season, I would love it. Provided there would be some kind of growth and social commentary, too. 

Victoria Pedretti is a great actress but I never really liked Loved. She just seems plain and not very deep, even when we see her with forty. She just strikes me as an impulsive person who isn't quite aware of the consequences of her actions. 

Therefore the first episodes of season 3 weren't amongst my favourites, I didn't enjoy the chemistry of love and Joe killing together or their dynamic as a couple. I see Joe as a woman chaser, it's against his personality to be with the same woman for a long time. 

I would personally love for Joe to meet someone who enjoyed his obsession and actually dreamed of meeting someone as obsessive and as focused as him, even if that meant pushing her friends and family away. Then I believe Joe wouldn't know what to do because she'd 100% a match for him.
I felt for Joe in this season. You can tell he really was trying to stop killing. In fact, the majority of the deaths in this season were caused by Love. Did Joe cheat? No, but Love definitely did. Love to me is a hypocrite. She gets mad at Joe for thinking of Natalie, yet it’s fine when she goes and has sex with Theo. Was Joe a good guy? No, not at all. I just didn’t get the hype for Love or her family. 

Also not really feeling Marianne
Don’t mind me asking but what is love’s IQ level? I mean I tried googling it but it didn’t say her IQ level it just said she’s very intelligent.I am just curious because love is an interesting character and I wanna know.
I realized that Joe kept the cycle going with abandonment with his son even tho he left him with good parents to take care of him. Even with good parents his son when he finds out he's basically adopted will have issues & resent both parents. Joe's mother gave him up, couldn't handle her son and now Joe gave his child up & especially because he was a boy.
okay so tell me this- 
it's in gLoBaL nEws now that joe goldberg from madre linda has been "killed" by his wife, before her committing suicide; and plenty of pictures of both of them have been attached to the news reports too. How the Fuck is then "Nick" roaming around Paris freely?? With no plastic surgery whatsoever???? 

i do realize the show runners want us to believe that police and judiciary are THE two most sluggish institutions to ever exist, but see-- the news dissemination thingy never happened before, like, Joe was never in the eyes of the media before, AT LEAST?

how even!
It keeps getting worse and worse, I feel like I’m hate watching atp
Honestly, after finishing this season, I think I hate Joe more than ever. Anyone else agree?
I actually wanted Love to kill Joe and be the narrator of S4. Yeah, he's made some development still; but everything to do with him has grown so stale and repetitive by now. There's nothing but hypocrisy left about Joe, and even that's not entertaining anymore. Love as a character got energy, antics, and unpredictable patterns, and I honestly wouldn't mind a season of her juggling single-momming and her growing craziness as everything is slipping away... trying to deal with murders (and their aftermath) on her own, to earn a living without a golden parachute for the first time in her life, to escape her past, etc.

Also, considering how this show clearly wants to lean into satire/social commentary, I felt the potential scenarios and opportunities for that would've been much more vast and varied with Love-struggling-single-mom as well as obsessive stalker-killer as a protagonist.

Well, alas.
I’m sad Love is dead. Would rather she was the main character in new series.
I'm confused what happened to love's mother.>!..like I know she went into rehab..but love's mother is probably going to be freaking tf out like..where is Forty (Henry)??!<

I hope they get some psychiatrists on the show....
Honestly have to say im sad that love died in the end, like her famous last words, they were perfect for each other
Theo kind of annoying.  Literally have been  skipping through his scenes.  Don't like his look either.  
Edit: good just saw episode 5, hopefully Joe takes him out. 
Also waiting for Love to kill her Mom- Lol.
I know I'm super late to this but I have to type this out. This was defintley the worst season but I don't think it was bad. Just never reached the heights of the first two. I was by far the least invested in this season. I just have to say, I'm so glad they killed Natalie. I didn't like her at all when I saw her. I was super worried all he would be doing in this season us chasing another women....again. and I was wrong, at least about Natalie... I just was overall tired of the constantly chasing women, and I get that's his character but it's getting annoying. Idk maybe it's just that I like Love so much because I do not like Marianne either. She is a good person but fuck I just like love a lot more. I felt they should have done this season as a bony and clide story with Love and Joe. They kill, do bad shit, together, as a team. They could get into a huge argument and try to kill each other at the end. Not Joe keeps fucking obsessing over other women and its boring. I still do not get why he is so okay with killing but when Love does it, it's bad. I know that's intentional but fuck it's annoying. 

For some background, I loved the first season so much. Beck and Joe's dynamic was amazing in that. I was so emotionally invested, especially in Beck. Beck was by far my favorite character. She wasn't perfect but she was a good person. Hence I hated how the first season ended. It was genuinely heartbreaking and I had to put off watching the second season for so long because I was upset. Especially upset with Joe. Season 1 was by far the best.

Second, I didn't know if I wanted to watch the second season. But I found our Jenna Ortega was in it and I heard it was still good. So I made peace with Joe lol and started watching. Even if im not watching for Joe anymore. He just pisses me off so much. Season 2 started with annoying characters, especially Forty but I grew to absolutely love almost all the characters in the show. But most of all, I loved Love so much. I thought I found her annoying at first. Now looking back at it, I did, but it was a funny type of annoying. Like I liked that she was. She was different then Beck and I could respect that. I grew to love her character the most. She was a highlight and when she was revealed a killer, it made it amazing. The ups and downs through this season are crazy and great. My two favorite side characters were definitely Ellie and Delilah.... suck what happened to Delilah. With Joe acting as a father figure to Ellie, I actually started to like him again and felt I could relate. There relationship is done so well. I hope Ellie comes back which it looks like she might. The main reason I think they will bring her back is because of how big of an actress she is now. Probably will reveal she is the stalker at the last episode of the first part. Or..... Love is the stalker. 

Back on topic, I barfed when it was revealed in the last ep of s2 that Joe was going after another girl. I knew I would like that. I was so happy him and Love were moving in together with a baby. I thought, like I said, it would be like Bony and Clide. But as soon as he says something about "I just loved Love and had this baby so I could move here to meet...you (referring to a new lady he has never seen)". I mean that's just terrible writing. Nobody wanted Joe to go after another fucking girl for the 40th fucking time. Nobody needed or asked for it. Yet we spend most of the first ep of s3 following this.... imo unattractive homewrecker when you have an amazing wife that is finally just like Joe. Idk that's by far the worst part of this season. Unfortunately it's not that only time it happens. He spends the latter half of the season chasing a girl that is nice, but just to me doesn't fit. And again Nobody asked for him to chase another girl. Hold shit. We actually get the Bony and Clide parts a few times from Joe and Love. Unfortunately a few times is all. It's not the whole season. Joe is just being fake as shit to this women that he really loved last season. It just is not a good story to me. But no, I don't think she is dead. I just felt like something else is going on there. I can back this up by the fact that for some reason, there is a big deal with Paris. Every women that has came into contact with Joe has said they would go to Paris. So i feel like they are gonna have something crazy go down in Paris. Like there all gonna be alive or something. Or at least most of the women. Ellie is gonna find a way to unite them and get them to come together to lock Joe up. That would be a solid story.

Only way this show can end is with Joe dead, and with a girl he is chasing being the one to do him in. Or Ellie. Or maybe Love if she's still alive. 

Holy shit this is long and its really late. Thanks for reading.
Is anyone else upset we still haven’t seen or heard from Paco or Ellie ?  He mentioned money for Ellie in one episode but we still don’t know what happened to those characters.. I was really hoping they would somehow be written into this season.. even if it was just brief, like how they did with forty :/
Love that dig on antivaxxers i hope potential fury of murderers scared them shitless (i mean since nothing else seems to)
Is anyone else done with Love?
Theo is hot as fuck btw
I’m loving this season so much. It’s so dysfunctional and feels less predictable than I expected it to. Haven’t finished the season yet, but Joe with Marienne almost feels like a regular crush rather than an obsession. Almost.
My ranking would be:  S2 > S1 > S3, but I preferred the s3 ending to s1. Also, usually this show's last few episodes are the best, but I think s3 had a stronger start and then was kind of middling.

Also, for the people saying Joe obsessing over someone new makes no sense or makes him dislikable, are we watching the same show??? He's **been** doing that lol. I think it has to do moreso with how people like Love's character and Victoria Pedretti's acting and were actually shipping them and wanting to see them have a happy ending. They don't deserve one, and they won't get one.

Edit: I feel the ending growing on me, I might end up like it over s2's end
Season 4 announced already? God save Penn Badgley
>!i’m on episode 6 and had to spoil the ending for myself. yes love is losing her damn mind but I hate that she won’t be in the next season. ugh.!<
This season was a disjointed mess but lord knows I'll be watching season 4 of this shit.

I seem to be in the minority, but *fuck* Love, she was completely unbearable this season.
I think that season 3 did a good job of portraying Joe as the lesser evil. They showed that he has an overwhelming desire to protect the people he loves, even if it means committing murder. In the whole season, Joe only killed Marienne’s ex which is a big improvement from his behaviour in season 1. We see that Joe will only resort to killing if it is absolutely necessary. He let Theo live, He tried to set up Marienne’s ex before he resorted to killing him. When Gil was in the cage, Joe tried to find a way to ensure Gil wouldn’t talk when he was free, whereas Love’s first instinct was to murder Gil. I’ve seen people say that Love and Joe are a perfect match, soulmates in fact. Maybe that’s true but their relationship was doomed to fail. Joe only stayed with Love because she was pregnant. All this season showed was how destructive their relationship is to each other and those around them. Although Joe is a psychopath, he’s shown to have remorse and a conscious. In contrast, Love is impulse and we’ve never seen her show remorse or humanity towards her victims. In Joe’s eyes, Love is a monster because he recognises that she is heartless.
Season 4 Predictions! Strap in, it’s a wild ride. 

I know everybody is saying that they think season 4 has no chance and will be boring and repetitive. I disagree, I see so many ways that this could go that we would not have expected. 

Call me crazy, One likely scenario: Joe’s obsession with Marianne takes him back to the states, intended to be a brief visit. I’m thinking perhaps he somehow finds out that she has relapsed (how does he find out? I don’t know. Writers…that’s your job) and he goes back to “save her” from herself bc that is his thing. Ew. This could literally be episode 1. It’s also in character with Joe, he would do something stupid like that and think he could get away with it. BUT, He gets spotted, manhunt ensues, throw in a few murders along the way because, of course. Perhaps some good old fashioned “Joe the hitchhiker/ killer” cliches sprinkled in there? 

Now here’s the plot twist. THEY CATCH HIM. Now depending on pace this could be season 4 or 5 but… we see a Ted Bundy like trial/ phenomenon here. He has crazy fan girls writing him in prison, falls in love with one, crazy Ted Bundy escape scene like jumping from a courthouse window and living in the woods. Something crazy like that. All to be with his new pen pal lover. Hell, maybe she even helps him escape and then he murders her because he was actually just using her the whole time.

Wow. This was my brain just pouring out ideas but all I’m saying is, there are options to *totally* switch up season 4.
This season fell flat. Too much focus on love and because we don’t have access to her thoughts, it’s difficult to connect to her as a character in any way. Found her annoying after the first few episodes. Also some lazy writing. ‘I killed Natalie’ whilst an orgy is going on in the house is just silly. Too many impulsive kills that didn’t really make sense. Season 1 takes the cake for me.
Marienne looks too much like Peach for his crush on her to be believable
Loves character this season definitely threw me on a ride. I wanted them to work, I hated how she was judgemental of Joe but then >!fucking the neighbors kid who is practically a child isn’t he? Like barely fucking 20?!<, then back to okay their relationship can be badass if they overcome this. Now it just feels like what the fuck is season 4 going to be about and do I even care? Season 1 ended with the reappearance of Candace- iconic. Season 2 ended with Joe now hating love, having a child, and moved to some suburb and if that wasn’t complicated enough trying to smash another woman who is married. Season 3’s finale is >!kill the dynamic shit show of a wife, drop the kid that COULD have been interesting if played out well which it wasn’t in my opinion, and then faking his death to freely follow the woman in Paris?!<Feeling really lackluster to me right now.
Surprise, surprise. Joe doesn't get caught again and miraculously makes it out of every tough situation. This show really makes our police and detectives look bad...
Wow. This doesn't even seem like the same show. they should re-title the show "It was". ..

Joe isn't Joe, it's boring, predictable, drab, the whole baby thing doesn't work. Uhg! Just no thank you!
I didn’t like Love this season she was so messy , she doesn’t think about the consequences it was very impulsive whereas Joe is more premeditated.. 

Joe was actually the good guy this season only killing 1 person for a purpose, where Love just got all kill crazy.. 

The only reason he killed Love was because she was going to kill him first, but he wanted to just separate normal and possibly coparent.

He did try to make things work with Love but she was too unstable. In the end, yes they are the same person .. but they really want someone opposite  of them (for Love, someone damaged to protect) (for Joe, someone pure and motherly) 

I do hope next season he runs into his mom (& kills her for closure) & or half brother.. that would be interesting and new. This season was a lil boring but the ending 2 episodes saved it. 
Overall 7.5/10
Am I the only one completely dissatisfied with season 3? I feel like they ruined the whole dynamic that season 1 and 2 created.
Love should have won.
Some points/opinions I wanna bring up: 

-When Love opened the bakery, I literally thought they were going to do a “Sweeney Todd” in modern day approach. I’m glad they >!made a reference of it in the end!< lol. 
But it’s interesting to me that in Season 2 they established Love cooks when happy and bakes when stressed, but then they shoehorned a bakery in to combat gluten-free, keto, IF, paleo, etc. in “fake, plastic, suburban hell.” I get why. But it’s interesting to note.

-I am surprised at the turnout of everything. I thought there was going to be a whole suspenseful storyline of using that advanced tech and hacking into webcams to really be building a case against the both of them. But instead >!Matthew was told to just drop it, and he didn’t get to do the satisfying payback I was waiting for by catching Love!< It just seems like everything gets wrapped up in a pretty bow and >!included in a housefire that gives Joe a new clean slate in Paris!< 😂

-Also found it interesting that Natalie painted Matthew as a cheater, doesn’t care, etc., which would help with justifying why she was >!trying to pursue Joe too!< but Matthew was intent on trying to figure out what happened to her. I get that it just shows the contrast between her and him, making a marriage seem shaky. But >!killing her off super early!< but making Matthew’s storyline last several episodes just made the disparity too pronounced for me. I’m also just being too sensitive about it because I’m overall disappointed at the season lol.

-They made Joe make such a big deal about the baby being a boy, and in my opinion they didn’t do much with it past a few episodes. I get why they did it- for his character backstory- but they didn’t expand on anything else throughout regarding raising the baby, how they would do it, etc. And that’s one thing I was waiting for. To see how they both raised him. The show took some… weird departures compared to how we ended Season 2, in my opinion. (Not dis-counting the fact that Covid made it difficult for actors, scheduling, etc. Just my opinion of what resulted.)

-Based off of reading a lot of these comments there isn’t much love for Theo overall. I will say I did cry when he was hurt. It was too..real. The way how he was apologizing. Poor kid.

-Needless to say the ending disappointed me too. I concur with a lot of comments saying the same thing with a lackluster ending. So annoying to see everything recycle looks like.

-(A more superficial, not-so important opinion of mine): THE MEASLES. THE. I mean wow. I will admit, being a med student has helped me to see that they did not do much research on what it is (and I get that it’s because it’s meant to overlay on the whole Covid pandemic, anti-vaxxer stuff), but more importantly (lol)… I have never heard anyone call it “The.” In fact, even in grade school I’ve never heard it called “The” lmaoo. But again, more superficial opinion, maybe it’s just because where I grew up or something. Not sure if it’s geographical differences or just poor writing?

It’s peculiar how the inconsistencies (I see) are what add to the irony and “sociopathy” of the characters in the show. Meaning like everything can be explained by something else lmaoo.  

I have more points, but made this post too long as is. I’m also still digesting the finale. 
Sorry for too many spoiler tags! Just want to be careful. (And I’ve never done them before! First time learning how lol.)
Prediction for season 4: Joe goes to Paris to stalk Marianne but bumps into Emily and gets obsessed with her and BOOM. Netflix crossover season of YOU in Paris.
I honestly can’t shake the disappointment with what this season could have been. There were so many ways they could have expanded on the first 4/5 episodes: Henry is kidnapped (Joe & Love use their collective skills to hunt him down and take out his kidnapper), Matthew Engler confronts them about Natalie or some serious questions are asked about that, Love & Joe could have worked together to take people out for a ‘good reason’ related to their family etc etc. Instead they absolutely bottled it and used no imagination to kill a story line that had MASSIVE potential. I’m still so angry
anybody else really uncomfortable with the amount of sex scenes? i had to skip cause they were cringe but this season was really raunchy! and the fact that love realized her and joe get off by violence???? yuck
Season 1 and 2 were good. This was 100 times worse than any Dexter season.
Joe has been a total dick this season. I really felt bad for love.
This show jumped the shark. First sign was when loves mom lit awhile vineyard on fire w a baby in hand. Love all of a sudden goes psycho and starts murdering ppl everywhere. Killcount higher than Joe's. Lastly, are we supposed to really believe that Marianne moved to Paris? Gtfoh
Anyone else was hoping that Joe will be killed, and we’d get Love’s POV in season 4?

It’s not that I don’t like Joe as a character, but I’ve had enough of him killing women and getting away with it. Would have been pretty ironic if he died the same way he got rid of his partners.
Gonna have to disagree with the multitude of commenters saying they wish >!Love had killed Joe and become the main character of Season 4!<. Maybe the person who pointed out that Victoria Pedretti is the reason we love her is right? Pedretti is an astounding actress. Love Quinn is just not a likable or deep character to me. She blamed absolutely everything on Joe, even innocuous things. Half her dialogue throughout the season was just victimizing herself in various ways. I was actually rooting for Dottie when Dottie called her out on it. The whole thing made Love very one-dimensional to me. The most vulnerable part about her is her codependence with Forty and I feel like that arc has definitely dried up anyway. Not to mention that her bouts of violence seem to be way more impulsive than Joe’s, and I’m sure she would have ended up in jail early on without Joe. Joe may have a fucked-up moral compass but I really enjoyed his attempted journey to self-awareness this season and learning more about how his childhood trauma haunts him. I’m very much looking forward to moving in a new direction in Season 4, whatever that may be.
Bruh, fuck Love dying. No offense to the writers, but if they literally have to change the "Love" interest almost every season then what the fuck is the point? Next season: Joe finds Marienne. Joe kills Marienne season 4. Joe's finds new Love end of season 4. Joe kills next Love season 5 like who TF even cares. The fact that I find this to be unoriginal even when I was praying to God the writers weren't this stupid is beyond comprehension. How tf is something that everyone expected (ala Love living) a better idea than their "original" idea. Absolute fucking shame. Fuck Beck. Fuck Candace. And fuck season 4. I'd rather fucking kill myself than to revisit this piece of shit
I genuinely think they should've killed >!Joe!< and >!continued Love's story.!< It would've given the series some fresh air.
This show was a solid 7, then became a 6.5 and 3rd season made it a 6. Too many random kills & without no serious consequences and lame woke / political bs. Also too repetitive as in u kinda know what's gonna happen in the next scene bar the cheap plot twists 

I'll probably watch the 4th season but they should focus more on the consequences of his actions

They're all terrible assholes btw except the gay couple and the kids
This season really highlighted to me that Joe is an absolute piece of shit. Before this, I was able to rationalize his behavior as someone who was sick and misunderstood trying to do the "right" thing. Making mistakes. Salinger was manipulative. Henderson was a pedophile.

But this season I realized that Joe is a terribly broken person that I actually hate. I wish Love had successfully killed him and that the series ended like that. She *was* perfect for him. She knew everything he had done and still accepted him. They could have been happy, but Joe is too broken for that. Unlike a Dexter, Joe is a serial killer with no redeeming qualities. He's just a force of destruction in the world who will break and kill everything as he meanders through life. He is an absolute villain. Pure evil.

I don't admire the main character of this show any longer. I legitimately want him to die. I can't wait until he does. He should. There is nothing redeeming about having someone like Love who completely accepted him only to fixate once again on Marienne, push Love away, gaslight her, and then kill her. It doesn't matter that she was going to kill him. He 100% deserved it. Joe deserved to be killed episode three of this season. What was Love's crime? Wanting to be loved by him? Wanting to be his fixation? Would that have been so bad?

I truly hope they kill Joe at the end of this show. I hope he loses. I do not root for him any longer.
This season went pretty downhill after the Natalie plot line was finished. Only saving grace was the great last episode. For sure the worst season of the 3. I'll probably watch 4 when it comes out but chances are that season will be really bad. The get obsessed over a girl bit, while intrinsic to Joe's character, has become boring.
I feel like this season didn’t really start for like 5 episodes. I just wanna see Joe being a stalker! Finally season 5 that starts lol
I already hate sherry
On the last episode, the beginning. I honestly am to the point where I think Love and Joe need to go down.. Love especially. She's so fucking impulsive, emotional, and unrealistic. I realize Joe is a murderer too. I could live with a season 4 but I don't think it's necessary. I honestly want Love out of the picture now. I hope Marienne escapes with her life. Guess we will see. Any others tired of Love now? I think she's run her course with me.
Absolutely awful ending. This show is getting so old. What’s the point? Everyone’s killed off or forgotten for the next season of the same exact nonsense.
I'm really sad that Marianne didnt see though Joes bullshit. She was written to be a badass single mom with a unfortunate taste for assholes but when she talked about running away with him I deadass believed she saw through his disregard for boundries  and creepy behavior, put 1+1 together and talked to the cops bout him maaaybe killing her ex. i mean, he basically admitted it on the phone, it should at least make her very cautious. They were way to happy and lovey-dovey  about this guy being killed. (yeah he was an ass but still, it was just the next sentence)
80% of the reason I watched this show was Victoria Pedretti’s Love. I literally feel physically ill now that she’s dead.
I hated Marienne’s character, she is terrible. She was crushing on Joe hard knowing he was married, and finding every opportunity to flirt with him. Not only that, kissing joe and knowing that she was feeling something for a married man all while talking to Love at the benefit as if she is such a good person. Also having sex with Joe still knowing he is MARRIED yet when Love found out and wanted to talk to her like adults, Marienne tried to act like she was a victim. Love should have killed her, screw Marienne and her child 🙄
I hate this season, nothing good about it.
Just started! See y’all back here later. Lol!
[deleted]
Love made me roll my eyes this entire season, so I was ok with the ending.  Honestly excited how season 4 will go and guessing it will be based off book 3?
Loved the inclusion of all the relevant topics from dumbass anti-vaxxers, college admission scandal, missing white woman syndrome.
It's not up to the hype for me. There is so many kill without developing any characters. Love is just a killer in this season, nothing special at all. 6/10
i don’t understand why joe and love don’t just slyly suggest to each other an open relationship??? im on episode 5 or something so if it happens idk yet edit: NVM THANKS SHERRY ILY U CRAZY BITCH
So many thoughts this season..disclaimer: love the show been watching since season one pre Netflix so there is no hate   
1, it was kinda all over the place, which didn’t feel right compared to s1 and s2.  
2. Love became very unlikeabke, we see she is unhinged in the end of season 2 and instead of planned killings out of misguided noble acts like joe, she’s a loose canon, just impulsive and thoughtless. She also shows almost no remorse, which hey at least joe is haunted by it (by no means saying he is a good guy)..but look at the kills, for him the most was the first haLF of this series and he actively tried to stop and did fairly well while she caused nearly every other problem even the cheating befor joe had really done anything ..  
3. joe seeing himself and gaining insight was fun to watch, I think had love not been killing anyone we may have seen no murders thise season (maybe Ryan but I’m not 100%) but he was doing better and working on the roots of his trauma, which there is so much.   
4. I would’ve liked to see a partnership for joe maybe s4 (not for redmeption) but to see if being able to finally relate in terms of trauma, on that level w his new more enlightened self and his general code of not hurting parents etc…perhaps we would see his behaviors radically change or discover his compulsions are his nature now and forever (as in gets bored of life w Mari and begins new obsession)…we will see  
5. its the Theo affair for me….I get the 40 parallel love maybe felt and need for constant attention and validation but I would’ve preferred not see her in such a predatory way, he is a teenager, a child really…just didn’t seem like her character  
6. I really missed something it didn’t understand the friendship with the women and love, they hate her they don’t they do again? And at the end it’s like recapping them but why, we didn’t really get to know them and they were bluntlay rude so idk what that was  
7. the whole poly scene …just wasn’t portrayed in a great way imo   
8, so many things didn’t add up….tech guy, missing wife ,,,everything works out..idk  
9. the amount of references to tech and cameras yet no one sees bodies being dragged out of the house after the failed swinger night etc…wtf  
10. I kinda wanted baby henry to go w joe so he could try playing house with Mari and just see his fantasy play out …I know w out Henry he will probably be worse off…idk  
finally, what was loves plan for joe, kill him, put him in with shery ?? Haha keep him sick…and when did he have time to do all the wolfsbane planning 😂   
I could go on and on….but there was so much going on and not laid out as clean as it needed to be…lemme know what you thought
Love was annoying the entire season. Made Joe look mentally stable
!!!!!SPOILER  SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!





I don't think Love is dead.From all the places that Marianne could've been born she was born in Paris? The city where Joe and Love wanted to go to in season 2? Also Love mentioning Candace at the beginning,,,yeah that's foreshadowing, she is alive and she'll come for him (at least i hope, i really like love)
I am keeping my expectations low for S4 cause if they continue with Joe's obsession- killing cycle it will get boring.
Theo is the absolutely the worst character ever conceived. Truly mocks the viewers intelligence.
I really hate the I wolf you phrase. 
Also episode 4 is so cringe 😁
I’m not looking forward to season 4 if it’s going to be Joe obsessed with someone else. You can only do that so much. Also sad that Love died, I was kind of hoping she’d kill Joe and then the next season would be about her and Henry!
Season one is still the weakness season for me, I think season 2 is better than season 3, maybe because I liked the dynamic of those two sisters in the last season and the most of the other characters and totally hated Theo in this season and Love new friends, though near the end I warmed up to love friends.

I'm a bit disappointed that Love died, but I'm happy that they didn't just kill off everyone just like previous season.

SEASON one, 7.5/10, season two 9.5/10, season 3, 8.5/10.

Season two characters were just really good!
Marianne the worst character change my mind
I don't know if anyone else feels this way but Theo was so hot! LOL I just can't. I was  literally drooling. Thank Universe he isn't 17 in real life :D
Honestly did not feel any connection between Joe and mirranda or whatever her name was.  I know part of it is the joke that Joe will become obsessed with anyone that's broken, I just really diddnt feel the chemistry and found myself rooting for him to give up on her and fix things with love instead
Here me out yeah joes next 'you' should be Emily in Paris
Well.  Here I am at the end of it.   An amazing season.  But the end…. Noooooooooooooo.  

This means the show is going to just keep repeating itself within this formula
The key Joe leaves in the cage is a bit strange and a bit inconsistent. He clearly hides it in some covering that snaps to the underside of one of the shelves, but when the Conrads are in there in Ep10. the key seems to fly out of some type of food cannister. So either its  a plot inconsistency or  Love hid another key in there that we don't see her do. If it is another key that Love left in there, why did they even show Joe hiding one then in that spot if it was never going to be seen or used in the future? Also, when Joe was hiding the key there in one of the first episodes it seems like he is doing it so that if he ends up in there at the hands of Love he will have a way out. It seems he is secretly hiding the key in the cage. But wouldn't Love notice that there is a key hole on the inside of the cage and that would come up between her and Joe about what that is for and why its a part of the cage. Interesting thoughts I had watching, because the key was always on my mind. I did think Joe would end up in the cage at some point and then use the key we saw him put there, but it didn't happen that way. Anyone else who might have clarifying ideas about the key?
Anyone else love seasons 1 and 2 but hate season 3? Idk it just felt different than the first two seasons.
Lmao typical reddit defending the forced sjw bs and simping for a murderer. You do realize Love was an impulsive psycho murderer right? Everyone in the show who was killed was bc of her, with the only exception being the reporter guy. Also equating measles immunization to a covid shot was too funny.
I really wish Netflix would stop chasing money by continuing shows further than they need to. If Joe had died alongside Love, this would have been such a perfect ending. Minus some loose ends like Ellie. Henry going to the two dads was ideal and made sense.

Love was right, they're perfect for each other and they both should have died. Joe winding up in Paris honestly bores me. So he will just keep on stalking, finding someone (Marienne?), rinse and repeat?

I hate the fact that they killed love quinn, I think that she should had been the end game of the series. I don't know what's coming up to season 4, I feel like it's going to be repetitive. I wish that season 4 is the last season, I want it to end up like love being alive then hunting down joe or joe being obsessed with the wrong girl who he thinks is just a normal girl flirting with him but in the end is going to turn him in. 

I love this show so much but It has to end decently, putting up more season of joe being obsessed with a girl again will make it repetitive and boring.

I'm up for season 4 if love queen is alive, I'm not being biased here.
The reason why I don't want the show to introduce more character is because
Introducing character = Stretching out the series 
Stretching out the series = More repetitive plot
We all know to ourselves that love queen should had been the key to end this series; Not marianne, not other girls
But im up for the idea of joe going to meet a woman in season 4 that will strongly match him in terms of knowledge and skills, not in murder of course, and that woman will be able to turn him in to the police. 
I want that woman to be 3 steps ahead of him and if possible 100 steps ahead of him.
>”!I wish the season ended with Love killing Joe and she being the main character in season 4. I like her much more than Joe!”<
we went from Love and Guinevere to that ugly librarian ffs
Gonna be honest this season kind of sucked.
love should’ve been the one to live. man.
Season 3 was trash imo. Lazy predictable writing .
Does the way Love like moves her mouth when she talks really bother anyone else? It’s so annoying to me!!
[deleted]
Ok, so I just finished S3. I think this concept for this show is kinda played out. There's no more shock value. S2 was great. It had great characters and we were still surprised by everything. In S3, I'm no longer surprised by the box or when Love or Joe goes crazy. I really think they need to reinvent S4 completely. I zoned out multiple times in S3. S2 was much more interesting imo.
This show sucks so bad
Looks a like another Netflix series has fizzled out.  On to the next one.
Finished the season and I actually really liked it! Victoria Pedretti have such a stepper performance. I hated her throughout this season so much and kept saying, “She’s just crazy!” the entire time.
Did Love ever explain to Joe or anyone what she originally did to dispose of the bodies from Season 2?
“Love” is the true narcissistic contradicting big ass baby crying bitch 🤣😂 At first I hated the Conrads but towards the end they weren’t so bad LOL
This season gave me gas
.. and not the good kind 😂
i hate love so much she’s pissing me tf off lmao
What's with the towel that Love tied around Joe's mouth after she paralyzed him?
It seems that this season was very interested in changing the formula and subverting expectations in an attempt to breath new life into the show. While I mostly enjoyed the season, I do feel as though these were missteps. I will say that most of these moments effectively established Love as an antagonist which was done only which partial success in Season 2. 

I didn't really like how Joe's obsession became a B plot. I feel like that should always be the premise of the show. They're clearly trying to take the show in a new direction, but I'm not sure that's the direction they want to go in. Taking Joe outside of America makes sense based on how things ended, but I feel as though we are dangerously close to jumping the shark.

Part of me enjoyed this season alot more than 2, but that is by and large because 2 also tried alot of new things, many of which fell flat and felt "off" (Forty, Candice, the Marriage etc.). I think the show really needs to go back to its roots. Season 1 is fantastic and I think that was the strongest the show has ever been. I guess we'll see what happens, but I wish Season 3 had left me more excited for the show's future than worried.

I would probably rate it a 7/10 (Which, to me is essentially like a "C" on an Academic scale)
I think Love is still alive. Or maybe I just really don’t want to come to terms with the fact that my favorite character is dead. In the last episode, we see her practicing a fake name “Julia”. All I’m saying is if we see or hear anything about a Julia in season 4, I know what will be coming next. If not, I’m really sad VP won’t be on this show anymore she’s a phenomenal actress and she looked SO CUTE at the library gala.
Anyone else thought he’d have an affair with the therapist?
I barely made it through Season 2, I think it was a real nosedive after season 1. So I wasn't sure I'd watch season 3, but I'm glad I did. Refreshingly tantalising after the disappointing second season. Predictable in parts but enjoyable nonetheless.
Difficult to watch even one episode. All the dialogues are too highschool girlish to watch. "I just had a baby, theres nothing terrifying about me"? Lady you just killed two women from previous episode! And whats up with Joe trying to connect with the baby? I thought he was a psychopath? He's doing more than my own father tbh. This is garbage level script.
In a show about two murderers, we’re led to believe that anti-vaxxers and privileged white women are the real bad guys. If it weren’t for the politics, I would’ve enjoyed it much more.
Nah this shit pisses me off. When will it end? Joe is pissi'g me off i just wanna see him dead
Why people saying it’s getting old for joe to be stalking new females but dexter kill a new serial killer every season and stalk 🤷🏾‍♂️ I hope Joe get a lot of seasons like dexter and keep going because Joe is a very good Character ‼️ My opinion
Love: impulsively murders someone

This sub, tryna hit: OMG NOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😟😟😟😢😢😢😍😍😍😩😩😩 I feel so bad for her
this whole season is a hot mess
this was by far the weakest season
How did Joe even get Natalie’s tampons? Don’t most women flush that part of it?
i dont think this season was that good.

i feel like it was very rushed? 

\-like natalie dying super early(whats up with that). espically because they made us think she was this big character at the end of szn 2

\-rlly liked the actor who played joe when he was younger

\-joe this season didnt seem to go the lengths he would normally go(like for beck, he did much worst things) but for marianne he honestly did not do much. was that because he knew if he did that Love would find out easily and do what she did(no spoiler) much earlier?

\-The only characters I really liked were matthew and theo, and im happy that joe didnt kill theo despite knowing what they joe and love did??

\-i wish they went to therapy more and maybe even get the therapist knowing about past things theyve both done.

\-i wish we get to see people from the first szn aswell in future seasons

\*\*all in all it was still good tv. i just dont think it lived up to the 1st season, def not the 2nd\*\*

\*i may change my mind about these things later because i just finished the szn but i didnt enjoy it as much as i thought i would\*
I’m just gonna go out and assume Love isn’t dead. Classic hollywood move to not show the death. Candace 2.0
SPOILER: >!I knew Natalie was dead the second I saw her - the actress was too hot, too old, and too untalented to stick around for longer than a few episodes 😂!<
I just wanted love dead from the beginning. Worst character ever
Season 3 was dull. Like watching an endless ping pong game of “ does he want me?” “Do I want her?”  It missed all the intrigue of season 1 and the hilarity of season 2. I just kept wishing Benson and Stabler would show up and solve the “mystery” of the rapidly mounting body pile in one swift episode.
Cary and Sherry stole this season! They did great haha. I enjoyed the comedy. I know that cycle of Joe being obsessed over someone is too repetitive, but for some reason it really drags you and makes you wanna be interested. Now I don't know what can happen in S4; Love was a perfect character for Joe, it should've been developed differently.
We didn’t even get to see Ellie and how’s she living yea they mentioned her but still how could they not include her, she’s just suppose to be alright with her sister being killed?
Is it me or did joe suck the entire fucking season. Love carried it the whole way and now I’m mad
Did anyone else watch this after watching squid game? 

I think I would’ve liked season 3 better if I hadn’t just watched such an amazing show. This left me…disappointed. 

Episodes 9 and 10 were great! But every other episode was just too mediocre IMO
This has been my faveee season so far. Superb writing and characters . Theo is my fave. I hope he’s in S4!!
I get post series depression every time I finish a season...gotta stop doing this to myself
Somewhat unpopular opinion?? I know she's still crazy af and pretty manipulative with the way she's always blaming other people but I actually felt really sorry for Love this season. Yeah, sure she kept causing problems but Joe isn't really any better and I never understood why he kept on acting as if Love was more dangerous and crazier than him when he's just as crazy, hell he's way worse and Love was right, she wouldn't even be alive this season if it it weren't for Henry and Joe  just casually thinks of ways you can dispose of a body in his subconscious.  

I'm not a psychology expert or anything like that but I really sensed some hints of depression in her and it was probably her obsession Joe speaking but I still felt bad when she was looking at herself at the mirror and was doubting the way she looks, Sherry kind of grew on me eventually but I still remember that scene where they were basically calling her fat. She expressed on a number of occassions how she feels sad and lonely and with just a simple look on her, there are non verbal factors there that suggests she's depressed or somewhere along those lines, particularly the look she has on her face where see just seems so empty, lonely and exhausted and it's sad because you could actually see her trying so hard. 

This role was made for Victoria Pedretti and no one could have possibly pulled this role off the way she did and is probably one of the main reasons why I still watch this, I hope she gets nominated for an award for this! She sure as hell deserve it
Love was annoying af. Joe’s annoying but Love, jeez
I don't understand why they couldn't have just had an open marriage full of jealousy.  Then they could continue to kill people and have a good fuck in the end.  It's ridiculous and just makes me mad.
Do you really think Love is dead?? We never truly see her body nor does the last voice over mention her body AT ALL. What if this will be something similar to Candace? Joe thought he killed love but he didn’t actually kill her & she’s just out and about like he is. 

What i would’ve loved to see from Season 4 would be two different story lines between Love and Joe not being together. 

Victoria Pedretti made this show 1000x better, her character development this season was incredible. If they did kill her off for good I’m not very excited for season 4. I could definitely see her being in Joes flash backs. If Joe goes back to his ways from Season 1 I’m going to be so disappointed with the writers. Obviously they had two amazing actors who could do pretty much anything and everything but I feel as though Season 4 will be stale & nothing new will come from this.
Holy shit this subreddit makes me very nervous when I see how many people talking about much they like Love lmfao
Love was fucking annoying. Could not stand her by the 7th ep. Ugh
Just watched the 2 seasons i had left. I watched season 1 when i came out and it was really good. Didn't pay attention to the show till now and i just binged watched the two seasons. Man this show is so good. I'm not gonna go into to details to tired. But i have to say this. Season 2 was my favorite. That Love Quinn being a murderer threw me off guard completely. Biggest twist i've seen in years. Never saw someone as cute as Love being capable of that. The final episode twist in season 2 made the entire season epic. Season 3 was also great. Joe is such a funny guy, no matter how good he has it. He always wants the chase. Love was perfect for him, but the chase and his stalking ways are to much for him to turn down. 

I really reallyyy rate the actress that play's Love. How she can be so cute, sexy and innoncent. Then turn it all around. That actress is gonna go places for sure, so long she doesn't get stuck doing dry comedies for some reason. For me although Joe was the main guy etc, she was easily right up there with him. Can't wait to see more of her work in the future. Oh yeah and she is hot as well don't get me wrong. 

As to the ending of season 3. In my perfect ending, Love and Joe gets everyone killed. It's them two alone. He realises that for sure this time, that Love is the only one that understands him. Because he always says it in the show but never means it. Because let's face it...Joe is the biggest hypocrite on there. Thinks Marienne doesn't care if he kills. Hence why i feel him and Love were perfect for eachother. But their ways of killing is really different. 

Love kills out of impulse most of the time. Joe kills cause of his plans that he sets up. But oh well. I will say this, since Love isn't in the picture anymore. If there is gonna be a season 4, i'll only watch it if Will gets caught this time. Gets interrogated and the cops get stunned by what he's done. If Love was still in the picture i'd watch another 5 seasons of her. Yes i seem to have a crush. How often do you see an actress be that innoncent in a show then just do a 360 and be a violent killer. Just wow...peace!
I am so sick of this series. I HATE Love!
Stupid a** show. Couldn’t make it past first season. I wanted to punch that weird little serial killer **ggo* in the face. No way anyone is really like that in real life, and if there is that is so pathetic.
Is it just me or did everyone root for joe in the first two seasons and this season everyone was kinda tired of his sh!t and wanted him to get caught?
Ending was a let down I feel so mad now
This season of You was pretty bad. Joe tied down to boring suburban life, locked down with a nagging psycho wife who constantly created more shit for him to clean up, dealing with father issues, and not least cringey political commentary inserted into the writing. And after the first episode I knew the rest of this season was going to be about him dealing with Love's retardedness. I muddled through the rest of the season hoping to be surprised, but I wasn't.
Just binged this whole show in like a week bc I kept hearing about it, and I have to say I wasn’t a fan of this season. The new characters were okay but my main problem has to be Joe. Joes whole hypocritical attitude towards Love really got me to dislike him a lot, it just seemed like Love actually loved him for who he was and he just treated her like shit. Unlike seasons 1 and 2 when the audience were able to empathize with Joe on some scale I just felt like Joe was just being an asshole this whole season, especially towards Love.
Reviewer on IMDB NAILED IT:

This has got to be one of the most insulting attempts to weave political commentary into a show that I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Every situation and subplot is engineered as a vehicle for lectures on Important Social Issues. We need a scene where Joe's delirious wanderings lead him to accidentally chat with the target of his scheme? Let's give him measles and spend the next three episodes whining about anti-vaxxers! His latest obsession happens to be a black woman? Let's use that as a platform from which to preach about intersectional feminism and also never follow through on her earlier characterization as an obnoxious, self-righteous busybody once we decide to turn her into a martyr. I swear to god, the subplot about Love's mom losing her mind and burning down a vineyard was only added so Joe could make a snide remark about how rich white women get off easy in the penal system."

I couldn't have said it better!
the last 3 episodes are some of the worst TV I've ever watched. horrendous writing.
Political wokeness was hard to avoid throughout the show. It seemed forced and unnatural.
Only half way through the season..why the fuck did they have to make it a vaccination message? It makes the show feel so cheap just to push an agenda.
[deleted]
How the hell does Joe go from Love to somebody as fugly as Marianne, I hope he gets caught and goes to prison just for being so dumb
Did they really name the 3rd episode "Missing white woman syndrome" due to the gabby case lmfao
﻿so was the woman sexually abusing young Joe?
Show is really bad ??? Anyone else 
Feels in-genuine
Now that I kept ranting about them killing off Love, and getting bored with the show. What if Love does a Candace and comes back?
>!!SPOILER!!< (possibly?)


Ok only just started new season really. So I don’t know exactly everything going on in it. However, does it seem like this show with season 3 is trying to push getting vaccinated for Covid?? Just seems super pro-vaccinations and heavy covid so far (for a TV show not actually about covid).
[deleted]
Never forget that the actor behind Forty gave us one of the worst performances of all time in season 2
I hate how liberal this season got, it was so bad. I loved this show and then I saw that it was pushing this liberal agenda WAY too hard and it completely took away from the immersion, I stopped at the anti vax episode it was just too cringe. No more you for me sadly.
&#x200B;

Isn't Love Quin a slut in season 3? I liked the season1 and 2. But 3rd season portrays Love Quin as a slut, having sex with a boy while her baby is in the next room. I don't think there is any other term for her character. If she cannot stop cheating, then she might as well charge a fee to get laid. That made me stop watching season 3. If anyone deserve to get killed in the season 3 end, I think it is her. (I didn't watch the last 3 episodes, as it started moving away from passionate love to pure sex.).
[deleted]
I knew their was going to be a rift between Love and Joe, my theory was it was going to be Henry not being Joe's son.

Also I thought the actress Tati Gabrielle did a fantastic job.
Just finished.

>!Theo should have died.!<
I seem to remember a criticism of season 2 being that it made Joe too sympathetic and likable in some weird way. All I can say is this season definitely course corrected because holy shit fuck that guy. Overall, really enjoyed the season even if it jumped the shark a bit. Looking forward to more.
I was really hoping joe would die and they'd make love the main character, it'd be so refreshing to have her perspective moving forward and more much interesting to see how she finesses people tbh
Is it bad that the only reason I wouldn't want Love as my wife is her infidelity?

Maybe I need therapy...
Its kind of sh... that they try to make covid vaccine that important on this season..
Season 2 was better but this one is also a pretty solid season overall. Though it would be even better if the writers stop preaching about identity politics and covid/vaccines. Some lines like "Unfortunately even in the age of covid some parents don't vaccinate their kids" were 4th wall break tier commentary and completely took me out of the show. Are people even capable of telling a good story without pushing their agendas onto everything?
If there had been any mention of Ellie, Delilah, Beck, Benji, Paco, Peach, or Any of the other characters that made the show great, I wouldn't have cared how lame the writing and direction was.

Season three sucked. And they had an extra year to develop it!
i see why yall don’t like marianne. just know i know why 💀 love was fucking annoying anyway.
This show is so dumb , dude and chick are morons amd I feel like it should have ended in a double kill , 
I mean it only makes sense since I saw this and last season. 
Both are the same people and it would have made sense if they both planned and killed each other at the same time,  even tho love was in the wrong
[deleted]
Honestly kind of lost hope up until episode 3, the script felt..rushed, before then, but after that, good god. I genuinely don’t think I’ve watched a series as well written as this one, the way Joe faces his own demons (learning to read people from a different perspective, developing empathy in the process) and slowly matures up until the ending, which couldn’t have been better, the way the script highlights the changes in his character and all the insights he’s had, and him finally breaking life long compulsions (when he sees the girl in the opening seen, and instead of going down that wishful train of thoughts, that always leads to irrational decisions, like he usually does, he makes the resolution. Can’t wait to see more from the writer.
Horrible
You can just tell what the writing staff of this show looks like. A lot of pink hair and they/thems in their bios
they went woke, i stopped watching, bad show.

ep 3 titles "white woman syndrome" oh plaese dude, all you see on the news is niggs who got themselves killed for doing dumb shit, im still waiting for leftists to find a hero for them that was not a lifetime criminal.
The narration is trying too hard for me. The super extra vocal fry. Just kinda cringed me out. Season One he just talked like a normal guy. Now he’s some over dramatic goth poet.
Really weird to me that the show never even addresses how disgusting Love is for going after a 19 year boy, often referred to or called "kid". She's a straight pedophile and there's no other way to dice it. Her, a grown adult women, slept with a teenager. Pedophilic behavior isn't going to stop happening if Hollywood/the media keep painting it as well-intentioned or romantic.
Won't be finishing. This is the first series that I couldn't even make it past the first episode. Ugh. What a disappointment!
One minute omg
It’s time!
It's out
Did I miss where she either thought she was pregnant and wasnt or got it taken care of? i thought she was debating in one of the episodes if it was theos or joes. If she was preg when she died and joe finds out i do wonder what his reaction will be.
[deleted]
The story was acceptable IF Joe is a psychopath who knows no feeling. This guy is now more indecisive and sentimental than a teenage girl! Introduce us to a psychopath killer couple and you make us watch them getting THERAPY??? WHAT??? Who wrote this shit????
Sorry, loved season 1 & 2. But this just did not do it for me. Joe’s dialogue/narration seemed so much more pretentious and try hard this season.  I just could not do it. The new characters in the show were not intriguing at all (save for Theo and Natalie, which I’d like to echo other commenters here that they were wasted potentials). Love seemed insufferable. So much cringe moments. I just don’t know.
Can someone tell me if they kill shari cause she's really annoying.  I was hoping they would blame Natalie death on her
One question I had was: how did Love inject Joe with the aconite? I don’t remember seeing her give it to him and it was administered through the skin instead of digested
Loved 2nd half of the season, love the spike in craziness towards the end
guess im the only who's not feeling this season, I just thought the storyline was meh... wish they added something new ig
Everyone out here talking about how the writers should have developed Joe and Love more makes me feel like I am one of the only people that just wants this series to end... They are falling into patterns they have repeatedly shown they cannot get out of. I would have liked seeing both of them die. Don't even start with the "maybe they should have just kept them both alive (WITH THEIR POOR BABY who will probably end up so fucked up) and have them transfer to another city *where they'll probably do the same thing again".* 

&#x200B;

P.S Don't get me wrong, though, I love the show. I love how they wrote the characters so much that I want a realistic, humane solution/ ending to the story. I cannot take any more of Joe and/ or Love stalking is all because it's unrealistic and very painful to watch(because they are pitiful).
“damn, I don’t think I really liked Love this season, she was pretty hypocritical. Joe too!” is an ice cold take.
What is that (supursion?) word? it came up alot in the sex scene, idk how its spelled i wanna google it.
My brain feels like mush after all of that. And I honestly have so many questions regarding his past and his mom scenes.
Love and Joe are psychopaths and awful people and deserve each other and everything bad that happens to them, but Theo annoys me so in a much more.
They really got my with the Natalie story. I‘m really surprised Theo made it but kinda glad because his father had already lost his wife to Love and Joe. I think overall the season is very pro adoptive parents which is nice. 

The season was kind of slow at first but by the end I could not stop watching especially the scenes in the cage. Those actors really turned out to be more important and I actually found them talking about how they met really touching. 

The thing I don‘t like is when shows include covid but place the show in a post pandemic timeline where it only gets mentioned very rarely. We‘re so far from that time (if we ever get there) that I would rather they go complete alternate universe where it never happened.

Though it was satisfying to see someone suffer for anti vaxxers and people covering up sexual assaults on campus. They really brought in a lot of current events with that.
I thought this season was just okay, but I’m honestly not interested in a fourth season. The characters became infallible, no matter what they did it somehow worked out.
I'm surprised Joe didn't wipe his fingerprints off Nathalie's car. Joe & Love both touched her ring as well. So if Gil didn't get framed for it, Joe & Love had their fingerprints all over her stuff.
>!Someone please explain why joe suddenly was able to move at the end ???? I am so confused because if he took the pills before then why didn’t he move when Maryanne was here only minutes before Love tried to kill him ? !<
I think it would have been interesting if they got caught and next season was about the media frenzy surrounding their trial and how people mythologize and build up these figures in the public eye, but I guess Joe is gonna be Joe
Joes mum >! Does she also have a pattern of leaving her children and starting anew over and over ?? !<
Currently on E:5 

I have to say I’m not a fan of this season.

1. Joe and Marianne is just not right 
2. There are’t any plot twist. 
3. Theo ? Come on. Joe should just kill him. 
4. So far I’m hoping that Ellie doesn’t come back. Cause well basically she is just selfish, know-it-all teenage.
>! Joe giving Henry to Dante and his husband was the best thing he could do for him. Really thoughtful of Joe too since they had been trying to adopt for years omg.

I liked the relationship developing with Joe/Henry though, I kinda wish he could also be a part of Henry’s upbringing. !< Also wished Ellie appeared this season!
I think the show should end with this season for good . S1 and S2 were amazing and all the characters too. S3 started off with great promise and kinda got dragged in the middle.  Love was hypocrite,  accusing Joe of cheating , when she is just as worse . Glad Thoe was alive . Sherry and Cary redeemed the last episodes.
Would anyone be interested in figuring out where the establishing shots are? Madre Linda is a fictional town and the season is shot in LA, but so far I’ve recognized San Ramon and San Jose in the establishing shots, and some place that looks like Marin ( I’m only on the first episode). These areas are far apart in relation to the Bay Area, so my guess is there’s no specific area of the bay that Madre Linda is located in. That sorta makes sense, because all areas of the Bay Area have rich privileged techie towns.
">"!Joe is a terrible person!"<"
Hello. Can someone help me. I’m not really good with this. But why did Love’s mother bought a Vineyard and told her that the money in flux isn’t there anymore
I just finished the season. I shouldn't have binged it, it was such a wild ride. 
I cried when I thought Theo was dead.  Felt so bad for him. 
In the end, I knew Love wouldn't be the one to make it out alive but seeing her dead was still pretty shocking. 
Sherry and her husband were the real MVPs this season fr though. I hated them at first but was cheering with happiness when she found the key.
LOVED this season more than the last but I enjoyed the book more. The books are so different but both are enjoyable as long as you're not expecting them to match. :)
I’m confused re Love and Theo….did she love him or
Was she completely using him to gain info about what Matthew knew ??? 
Cause she had no issue in “killing” him? 
Also…did Matthew not feel bad atall reading that Joe died at the hands of Love after leaving him there ? 💀
I reckon Love lives and uses the alias Julia in the next season
It's a dumb criticism but they acknowledge covid, which puts it in this show's universe, but nobody is wearing a mask. Even in hospitals which I'm pretty sure require them regardless of state guidelines, they all have their mask under their chin.

You wanna acknowledge the existence of covid in your fictional show, at least make it kind of semi-realistic.
So, my final reactions on what I feel are loose ends:

1. I thought it was weird how much Joe mentions Ellie at the beginning when that ultimately didn’t go anywhere. I thought she was going to make an appearance or that storyline would tie into this. Since she now thinks Joe’s dead, I’m assuming she’s gone to the police to explain what happened to her sister? Or is she still laying low because she’s afraid this will somehow put Henderson’s murder on her?

2. I was also thinking that the Dr. Nicky thing would come back after the surprise at the end of season two. I’m assuming that’s also done for now, until Joe is somehow revealed to be alive to the rest of the world?
Jesus. Easily darkest season yet.
**First** , like many of the good people on here I binged in one night ! 😂 **Second** , no offense to the actress that played the ‘**Liberian**’’, I felt to chemistry or sexual tension between her and Joe . Additionally, Im not a an acclaimed film critic , but her acting was off .   
Consequently, I found myself fast forwarding her and Joe’s scenes, along with the many dragged out plots with Joe And love ❤️ 💕.   
**Spoiler below , this is my first post I don’t know what I’m doing ! Spoiler I say!!**

Furthermore, I did not loose any sleep over when love died at the end . 💤🛌Thus, I understand the character arc of being an ‘**unhinged suburban mom serial killer “ .** However, she was maternal instincts and loved her son , but still made selfish and dangerous choices !

Nevertheless, I did watch the season in one night and thought it was pretty fun at times! **My biggest anguish how they both disregarded their own flesh and blood . Especially, after the toxicity and trauma they both experienced as children from their parents**.   
I was relieved he was in a safe and happy home in the end, surly it should of never even got that point!
Fun season. Love and Joe really were meant for each other.  Also fun it was set in the Bay. I imagine they probably lived in Santa Rosa or possibly Sausalito....actually reminds me a lot of Sausalito. Kinda hope season 4 won't be Marienne...I don't want Joe to kill her :(
You season 3 is the meat of the relationship between Love & Joe. Which highlights the attractive similarities of desires, struggles & yearning to be accepted. Yet outlining eaches approach to expressing frustration & vulnerability, through irrational behavior. Double underlining essentially the battle between:

Impulsive vs Calculated

One liking to plan for everything, like a disillusioned Caped crusader, protecting loved one's around them.
The other reactionary to fear & emotions in the moment, ready to do what it takes to protect.

I find it funny that even with the same perspective, this simple differences in expression, drove a wedge into attraction between the couple. Although in the realm of dating, we all seek our morrior image 🤔
Even though I was very surprised at how much I liked this season and that the writers were incredibly creative/clever, I found the Marienne storyline to be somewhat dumb. I understand Joe has issues and can't help but jump from one woman to another(they do stay true to his character) but I feel like they failed to make that part interesting. 

I thought it was a good twist that Natalie ended up dying early on by Love, and not being a season long fling for Joe, but part of me feels like her dying so early is what caused the boring relationship with Marienne.
I honestly really loved this season. I loved that joe was cleaning up loves messes. I loved to watch her come undone, Victoria played her so well it’s insane. But really I think she had to die or else what?? She would just keep killing people? The moment she hits Gill, I had a feeling it would never end, like she would keep doing impulsive things and the only outcome would be she gets caught or dies. I think it was a great way to end the season and end her character arch. Anyway as for Joe… I really hope they don’t drag him out next season, bc I agree with everyone watching him stalk is boring now. I think his growth was OK this season but he still went back to his old ways so yawn.. and then he followed Marianne to Paris!!! Okay…. Honestly I hope we get ending where Joe’s rightfully dies or gets caught, like the ending of breaking bad. It’s only right that joe eventually dies or gets caught imo. But I am totally on board for another season let’s see what happens, there are so many loose ends that I hope can come back.
Total underutilization of Scott Speedman
Love ain’t dead, there’s been quite some foreshadowing in the show, but there’s been one piece that’s been so consistent this season, and I’ve come to the conclusion that  I don’t think Love is dead,
This season wasnt good. I could barely watch it. Painful tbh..
They should have stuck with the Bonnie and Clyde shtick that the first 3 episodes carried, and had Joe try to escape out of it in Season 4.
**Spoilers**

It really bothers me that they would even keep Love alive at the end of season 2 if they were just going to get rid of her and Henry anyway. 

All of the characters this season felt like complete plot devices, no depth at all. It didnt feel like there was a connection between any of the characters. 

Would have preferred Love killed Joe and season 4 was her POV.
The entire thing was great --- except for the last 20 minutes. The show generated a lot of character over season 2 and 3, for it all to be thrown away. It is going to take a lot of work for season 4 to not be repetitive.
Season 3 was bad IMO. Very boring and predictable
I kinda hate the closure of season 3. I'm so used to being in suspense as to whether or not Joe is gonna get away with it. Really wish they concluded Joe and Love Quinn a bit slower. Even though they were not madly in love, Joe made it clear she was the only one who saw him for who he was, and they had so much in common. I thought they would at least fight it out, before Joe would have no choice but to give "the shot". Or at least they should have removed by other means.
Kinda hated it. I expected better. Not sure if I’m going to watch season 4. So sad because I really liked this show.
The ending should have been Joe and Love create an alliance to abduct, torture and kill woman. Just like real life serial killers. Not saying at this point they are not cause they're serial killers but too many justifying. Tbh they both enjoy violence and murder. Unfortunately Love died. Her character was more interesting than Joe.
This season was a lot to process.. wayyyy too much for me
Hated the ending love shouldn’t have died
Quick question: Did I miss something? Didn’t Love want to hire her private detectives? Then never talked about it again? Maybe I missed a part? I thought maybe the person she hired was going to be one of the ladies with access to the neighbors computer. Or am I crazy because I binged too much YOU too fast?
The first half of the season was so good, loved watching Joe and Love. They dragged the second half a lot, was really boring to watch. 

The season finale was predictable, was expecting some kind of twist. Not even excited for season 4, hope they do something refreshing next season. 

Gonna miss Victoria as Love, she was amazing :(
I loved listening to Love’s narrations, Victoria’s voice was perfect and is calming to listen to (lol).

>!I’m glad that we got to see Forty one last time.!<
I just don’t seem to believe the money thing. Where is he getting from when he even stopped the book thing mid way through? Also ok now how did he get a passport and everything to move to Paris? Like I hate plot holes
Anyone else just despise Theo, like every second he’s on screen I want to tear my eyes out
Cary has PC Principal vibes from South Park
Just finished.Damn Paris huh. Can't wait for s4 and Ellie just accepted her sister was dead ?? Hmm
I enjoyed this quite a bit, I didn’t  have high hopes for this season. I thought Joe would repeat the same tropes all over again with the new woman he had found. (Which they kind of did) I had initially thought ending it at season 2 would have been great since Joe was getting to spend his life with someone equally, if not more crazy than he was would been some form of poetic justice. That being said, I really enjoyed this season as from the end of episode one, I knew I was in for a ride.

Once Love knocked out the guy who gave her child measles & Joe found a new woman to fixate on,I knew they were never really going to ever redeem themselves as characters. I could not have asked for a better ending for the character of Love. Victoria Pedretti has been so great in everything she has been in so far ( I liked her in the Bly Manor series as well)

That being said, I wonder how will Joe’s arc eventually end, considering the amount of suffering he is caused other people, directly or indirectly.

I am on episode 5 and don’t mind spoilers. I have to say that love’s character is awful in season 3 and her relathionship with theo is just gross and I hate Theo for actually pursuing a married woman with a child
Who has seen the finale?😭 it really had me on the edge and reminded me of why I love this show. He really one upped Beck’s death. Throughout the season, I was getting fed up with Love and her shenanigans…But overall she is my favorite character besides Joe because her and Joe were alike. I cannot wait for season 4!
I wasn’t either… I was kinda pissed. It looked like she was/would of given “Love” a run for her money. “Love” was entirely pathetic. Every time she talked I just hated her more & more.
i’m so disappointed with love’s story coming to a close. i was really expecting and looking forward to a S4 where love tries to hunt down joe, à la candace, but genuinely interesting this time around. they could have done so much more with her arc.
This shit was trash literally season 1 but worse in every way possible and the dialogue is cringe af
Spoiler alert i will now write about the whole season so if you didnt watch the whole thing dont read further.


So ,where do i start i will simply write things that doesn't make sense to me.

1- when Love killed Natalie ,they got rid of her body in the woods ,as it seemed from the show very close to the cabin,then police found the ring on the sink ,people searched the woods and somehow still failed to find her body in a shallow grave,or if they did found it it was never even talked about??!

2- all the things her smart hi tech husband looked at ,the camera footige i mean ,and still to what cause?he looked for anything as it appears for days and somehow missed what his son manage to find in the back of the car in like 5 minutes,amm ok.

3-dont even get me started on that neigbour they pose as hanged in his home,like,there is something called time of death,and other than that dont forget he was strike at the head,leaving wound,and ofc that wound or bruise would be visible on autopsy also letter "he" left was writen on keyboard lol why?it would not be strange to anyone given the circuimstances?ok.

4- how would police not apper much more in the series?Like Love was the last person to see her alive and still that was like it was nothing they didnt even bother to look in the basemant of fresh tart.

5-Joe and Love chemistry is at least to me non existent,one day they are in love other day it would be so easy to leave or to just kill eachother,one day she/he is the one ,only one who understands the other half,then tommorow the one is some woman form library or some kid.

6- at the end Joe leaving his toes on the scene ,setting the house on fire in a neigbourhood full of houses ofc no one saw anything strange at all,and not to mention those poor two toes would probabbly be really hard to find after fire also why did he even put one inside the cake ,its gonna burn anyway,how can everyone just assume he is dead just cause of his toes is beyond me lol.

And other things i will write are not really mistakes or not possible but just my opinion on carachters.
Joe especially,he is presented as this so smart dude then still somehow fails to see he always does the same thing,has an idea of someone and has to have them no matter the cost,then when he sees they are also a human beign with flaws he just kills them and move on,he is not really that much self concioues as he would like to bealive,because he doesn't love anybody actually,he is in love with an idea of love and  into an idea he is or can be normal when he really isn't he is a classic psychopath,only really not as charming or anything as its pressented,take away his thoughts for a moment when you are watching him comunicate with others,he is not really fun,charming or special at all,avrage looking too, but somehow girls just adore him,although he's giving nothing personality related.


This is just my opinion on things ,and sorry for my bad English ,its not my native tounge.
My theory for S4 is Joe will die in similar circumstances like the killer in the lovely bones. I don’t want a big flashy death sequence. I want a low key death that is fitting to the character and motto what goes around always comes back around no matter how long it takes. When he starts to stalk another girl he gets hit by a bus or something.
I enjoyed this season a lot! I’m so glad I spread it out over a weekend and didn’t binge. I really didn’t mind the ending. I was so tired of Love’s shit by the end, seeing her die felt satisfying. I’m interested to see how the show does without her in S4. I do see why people are tired of Joe’s stalking, but I just think that’s the show at this point.
Question: who is the actress playing Matthew’s lawyer?
I like Joe, but man, I did not care for him and Marianne at all. Easily the most boring part of this season. The rest of the season though? Loved it. I'd totally watch a spinoff set in the same neighbourhood with Sherry and Cary alongside the rest of the side characters. I liked them that much. Shalita Grant is amazing and I want to see more of her. Not sure if she's the reason why, but this season reminded me a lot of Search Party in terms of its vibe and general chaos. The partners-in-crime murderous couple dynamic was just too good.

>!Which is why I'll REALLY miss Love in S4. I don't know how S4 is going to pan out, but going back to Joe's monologue stalking (like we did with Marianne) after what Joe and Love offered together will be a big letdown.!<
I'm telling you. The best thing they can do: pull a Candace with Love and have her get a spin-off or full character back in the show. They didn't develop Marienne enough for me to like her and root for Joe to end his wife's life like that. >!I really hope Pedretti's character has some kind of second act.!<
Who else thought Theo was annoying asf?
As much as Ryan was a dick, I'm glad after 3 seasons that someone finally recognised Joe on the stalk, despite him wearing his baseball cap that supposedly makes him unrecognisable.
Seen a bunch of people speculating that Love isn't actually dead. Imo if they were to pull that stunt, that would be the moment I lose all respect for the writers. As much as I would love to see her back again, it would just be such a massive plothole. Even if she, like Joe, "had a feeling" and took the antidote beforehand, if the cops could find a couple of Joe's toes, I'm sure they would have noticed if they couldn't find Love's body.
Was there any significance to the bunnies in the garden and the hole in the fence of Joe and Love’s home? I thought that would be explained
The epic showdown of the psychopaths was incredible at the height of episode 10! How Love put the paralysis concoction on the knife knowing Joe would grab it when she went out, and Joe realising how she was planting the deadly plant in the first place, having the antidote standy and making a more potent concoction to finish her ! That was thrilling 

Have to say Love’s impulsiveness is what made the show super exciting for me i think this was the best season.
Was kind of surprised seeing wolfsbane in the garden. And can’t believe I missed that detail. In Ginny & Georgia the main character gardens that as well. Thought that was interesting that it’s in two shows.
[removed]
I personally think the ending kind of ruined it. Joe gets away AGAIN. Like he is some super human. He moves across the world during the pandemic with…what money and how? With what passport?

Maybe I’m crazy but I was hoping for a Theo/Love ending where Love convinces Theo to kill Joe and season 4 being a struggle between Love finding someone else/providing for Henry and Theo processing killing Joe for Love.
Does anyone else think they should have gone full sweeny Todd this season?
Does anyone know what episode Dotti talkes about Love killing her 1st husband? Or that red themed Halloween(?) party? They were shown in flashbacks or talked about in the last episode but I had no idea when they were shown in the series.

Like that party was a whole new scene right?
Anyone else so tired of Joe and him being able to get away with absolutely everything. I think in a way love deserved better than Joe. Vice versa, they were to us and never should have stayed together. Joe gaslit the hell out of love and he constantly is holding the mirror up to love as if he doesn’t live in a glass house. He can’t suddenly choose to be a good person as if he never did all the things he’s done. I think what they did with his character this season is just irredeemable. I’m completely disgusted with Joe.
[deleted]
I have to say this has to be the weakest season but also against two amazing initial seasons. The writing here is predictable and future scenes are written as pathways instead of feeling like natural progression e.g. replacement caterer for the library.

Me and wife were incredibly excited for season 3 and rewatched season 1 and 2 in prep for it but wow the amount of what seems to be retconning of loves character and even dumbing her down it seems?

It was hoping for more function within their marriage from helping each other's impulses instead of just ejecting from their marriage instantly.

The forced forbidden love between Theo and Love was 1 disturbing to watch and 2 not logical like the writer's seemed to think it was. Did they just get off watching Riverdale before scripting this?

We are on episode 7 so far and I literally can't wait for it to end so I can move onto Sex Ed.

God I'm so disappointed in this season and it pisses me off that this show got me to that place.
Saw Marienne at Library counter next to Natalie and thought ... 'oh we're all so stupid, it's 2021... no way they putting Joe with a third white girl, it's gonna be her'
we need the conrads next season!!! my heart shattered when i saw the flashback of joes mom abandoning him while having another son she loved and took care of :(((( also am i the only one who felt joes obsession with marienne was forced and random? it just didn’t seem genuine. and finally love is worse than joe idc
Finished watching the season. This one confused me, NGL. I just found it weird, I guess. Where I didn't quite like the story line they chose for this season and wished that they focused on one logical plot. Perhaps maybe they should have fleshed out the therapist story line and have that be the main theme?

What I DID like was the script and the acting with regards to the humor for the secondary characters. The actress who played Sherry and the dynamic with her husband was SO funny. I really enjoyed the directing, script, and the acting on their scenes.

Besides that, not sure what to make out of what I watched. I have a feeling of distaste, but I'm sure I felt that in the other seasons as well. But with this season, I feel like that feeling is more prominent.
I really enjoy this show but the series of chaotic and stupid decisions made this season a lil annoying for me.
Anyone else really hate Theo? lol.
did they find love’s remains in the house???
Anyone wanna tell me why Joe put his Toe in the baked food?
Fucking... damnit.  I'm spoliting the whole shit here so this is the warning.

She is the ONLY person who will ever see him and know him and be okay with it. That's what he said he wanted. That's understandable. Then he gets that and he's all like "yeah, nah, ima go stalk a bitch". Im almost impressed that he realy manages to convince himself this time is different. Although to be fair the writers do, do a hell of a job making it feel genuine, this time around. Like this one is really the true love magic fairy tale soulmate. Even though he's never going to be happy, because anyone who would accept him would be as damaged/crazy as he is, which ofcourse knocks them right off that obsessive perch, which is a genrally unfair place to put anyone. 

Always kinda tragic that he's so fucking obsessed and never bothers to consider how they would feel about his actions. How everything he thinks he's doing to bring them closer together becomes just another thing they could never know about him, because if they did they'd rejecet him in a heartbeat. 

The funny thing is, they could've made it work. He could've had his little side things and she could've had her projects. They could've been honest with eachother about it. Except they were both planning to.... Well, she wasn't really looking to kill him whereas he "got the dose right". 

Also on the tactical end, my man how you gonna stalk people in the shdows when you're missing a couple toes? Gonna be kinda identifiable with a limp, not to mention you're legally dead so how the hell you're gonna travle innernationally idfk. Seems like he's got one more season of this before everything catches up to him, or he becomes some kind of assassin. Honestly i'm ready for him to get his just deserts, the only happy ending he was ever going to get was Love and now she's dead. He was so close too, he almost had it. For the record i was totally prepaired for this to go on some kind of SantaClarita Diet tangent but more serious.
Wait in the final episode how did love dose Joe, i know she said through the skin, but when did that happen was it on his t shirt?, i assumed it was the chicken but she ate that too
This season went so many places and so fast, and then wrapped it up so loosely, it's hard for me to grasp.

I was really hoping Love would make it through the season. She was my favorite and the episodes where we heard her inner dialogue were the most interesting. Love wanted so hard to make a happy family, and Joe did too. I was hoping they would make it out in some sadistic way. My heart sank when she died and they did it so poorly. She commit suicide? I guess nobody even remembers Joe? It was such a loose ending. 

I loved the twist of this new season, but it's questionable whether I'll come back for another season because this one was not nearly as good as the previous one IN MY OPINION
I'm talking to a friend about the season 3 of You and were having a discussion and would like your opinion. Is it really all Joe's fault about everything in the season? (My friend's opinion). Or is love and Joe's fault bout everyting in the season?
Does this season feel like a really long clip show or is it just me? 🤔
Poor Love, I was looking forward to knowing her more.
Marienne and Joe’s relationship together was boring IMO. Wasn’t a fan of her character and their love story. It didn’t mesh well with the rest of the story.
I just want Joe gone now, it’s boring.
Love really gives Joe a run for his money
So I’m kinda having mixed feelings about the ending. Love the show, but I’m not digging a whole new season where we revisit another season 1 or 2 in a new country.
>!I’m upset Love isn’t a part of the show anymore because then we’ll probably never know what she did with the bodies. She really took her secret to her grave !<
Sherry's character was interesting and they could have built in more dimensions. I am definitely more into her than Marianne. Love's character was really shallow and inadequately written to kill her off. Joe's pattern is boring me, his childhood backstory as generic as could ever be and I wonder if I ll watch the next season. Penn Badegly is charming but nevertheless, constipated throughout, the Dan Humphrey antics all over again makes me wonder if he is capable of playing any other character.
Shouldn’t have binged this season. Still #TeamLove.
They had a lot of actors in the show that were known for other stuff that I got distracted.  Like both Cary and sherry were from last ship and ncis Nola, I saw Travis from station 19, and Vanessa from daredevil
The Theo and Love story was dumb in my opinion. Ruined the show for me.
Is it just me or is the camera a bit blurry on certain convos?
For whatever reason, I think this season would have turned out completely different if the baby would have been a girl versus a boy. Joe was excited about having the baby and becoming a father when he thought they were having a girl, but his tone completely changed, and never got to the full excitement over the course of the season having a boy.

Example of how the storyline could have changed: I don't think he would have >!Jabandoned baby Theo at the end of the season if it was a girl.!<

Curious to hear your thoughts on this.
Currently rewatching show (from S2 onwards bc S1 isn’t really related that much) and I'm picking up some hints from that season- some have turned true or happened S3 others could happen
I really thought Love was going to pin it all on Joe and we’d see him getting arrested at the end… didn’t think Love would be killed off so easily
How did Joe escape to Paris? How did he even get a ride out of that town after blowing up his house? They should’ve shown him in Paris with blonde hair and black-rimmed glasses.
Considering the emotional roller coaster this season was and how insane love is, I believe Love made it out alive somehow and she is gonna find him in Paris in season 4 when it comes out. Do you actually think she’s dead??
wow. the acid episode of season two and the last episode of season 3 had me in a CHOKEHOLD. this season was amazing. maybeee some excessive klling (i mean.. if theo didn’t make it i would’ve cried 10x harder)
the foursome scene was beautifully written. 💀💀
Who plays the shrink in episode 2?
I really disliked the season overall, it felt stale and repetitive. Some plot points were just forgotten about completely. The ending was just ridiculous relative to the character decision making during the season. For example, lets just murder Ryan in public and say “it’s a mugging” even though the police would investigate much further after digging even slightly ..

I felt Love was hard done by in the end, just another generic character to Joe the main guy.
Well, i got a doubt. Could forty be still alive? I mean he replied to the message as 🍕. Could he have saved love at the end? I am still processing
[deleted]
What was with forty texting back? Was she just drunk and that was theo?
You meets Emily in Paris? 🤔
One thing that threw me off is that Love cheated on Joe but how the turn tables when she finds out he cheated.
Sherry and Cary grew a lot more than I thought it would
I Wish they thought of a more creative way to end Love's reign, but ANOTHER form of writing to sum things up and conveniently tie up all lose ends?! 😕 (becks book and now a mass email to HOA) they literally killed half the people in town, it was getting so unrealistic! I have so many questions for these characters, I thought they were going to bring up the vital rings more, like how did Matthew the creator of this device not check Theos last location and his vitals when he couldn't find him. He spent weeks looking at camera footages but didn't think to check the business across from the bakery parking lot?! Or how if he thinks Gil didn't commit the murder then shouldn't he look into what happened to Gil and see that Gil also went to the bakery days before his demise? Why does everyone in this show leave their doors unlocked especially Love who always has people locked up somewhere. Also how did Joe manage to fly to Paris without authorities knowing given he was pronounced dead! Love how entertaining the show is but so many questions and plot holes
Love got flanderized hard. She went from being a dynamic loveable character to being the stock "crazy killer".  And don't even get me started on the bullshit wolfsbane twist. So convenient.
Just curious - did anyone else find themselves oddly relating to Joe and Love in therapy or am I crazy? Obviously not the killing people out of jealousy part.
This was a good season but I was really hoping love and Joe would crash and burn in the end. He can't keep getting away with it! There was a spectacular setup for a great crash and burn moment where they either both kill each other or both end up in jail or something.
Imagine Cary did end up dying and the last word he uttered with his dying breath was “sexy” after his wife slapped him in the face
I'm a little disappointed with Joe's complete turn on Love since Love, Actually on S2. I was expecting/hoping for a reconciliation between them and an effort to make it work. I think a dynamic like that would have made this season much more exciting with potential for a will they/won't they storyline.

This is a reach but I'm hoping Love miraculously made it out in the end and that the writers will save her return for a later/final season where Joe and Love finally end up together. Ha ha can't even take myself seriously writing this but I dream. I'm so not finished with Loveee

I share the view that the "Joe stalking a new You" storyline is too predictable and leaves the viewer uninvested in the next target. This especially goes for Marienne, in my opinion, because she was introduced later in the season and in a way that makes you unsure if she's just a fleeting crush.

Special shout-out to Bree Van de Kamp!
It was a good episode but at the same time it felt like a wasted opportunity for a possibly even better one? With Natalie and her surveillance tech guru husband I thought we'd get a more intricate storyline where Joe's past mistakes will be gradually uncovered. Instead it turns out the tech guy is more like your regular business grad since he comes across not in touch with tech at all in the end. What was the point introducing these tracer rings for instance?
thought this season was a letdown :/ stopped watching halfway through
If anyone has watched BHHE I wonder what would happen if Joe fell Lin love with Adele
DAE think it sucks? I could barely get through the first episode because the plot was so shit and rushed. Like has it always been like this??
I'm watching episode 6 right now and I need clarification on what Joe meant by "you're a pattern, you're a lost lamb attracted to wolves". Mother issues yes, but can someone elaborate lmao
This season was okay, but I hope this is the end of the series because I don't know where else they can go with this.

>!The letter that was with Henry when he was left with Dante in the end would have had to be written by Love because Joe would have had to drop off Henry then come home to be supposedly killed. But Joe says that there is a last part of the letter just for Henry and Joe. !<

Anyways both were dumb. Love is so impulsive. But Joe >!should have gotten rid of his bloody shirt, if it wasn't for that he would have gotten away with it. But I guess either Joe or Love had to die because I don't think they would have really gotten a divorce knowing what the other one did.!<
They really didn’t have shared locations like wouldn’t half the problems not arise if they had location on😂
I’m exhausted.
The writing is great. It’s amazing how they made every season feel different. 1 had a stalker preying on an innocent girl. 2 had that same stalker preying on someone who’s at least just as crazy. And now 3 has them together. I feel like it’d be a perfect way to end the series but they just announced season 4 so I’m curious to see where they’ll go from here. I’m optimistic that they will find a way to make it unique from the others — I just hope it doesn’t become redundant. Maybe someone stalking him for once? I don’t know. 

A lot of people seem to appreciate Cary and Sherry at the end. I thought they were both annoying but I can respect that they manifested their horrible experience in a mature fashion. 

I can understand why Theo was hurting but I couldn’t help but feel annoyed at him constantly pressuring Love when she continuously rejected him. She was falling to a low point and eventually became vulnerable. It can be forgiven based on him being at a low point as well with no one else around, but it just came off as opportunistic to me. 

I saw a meme floating around where basically this whole thing could’ve been resolved if they opened up their relationship to Theo and Marienne instead of Cary and Sherry. I couldn’t agree more. 

The inclusivity was great. Didn’t feel forced, wasn’t extremely subtle either. Felt very natural and I was all for it. 

I’m definitely gonna miss Love. She was perfect for him. Just the way she was so desensitized by his actions and accepted the reality that was presented to her. Like, if I was Joe, she’d be my dream girl. I wish she got to know that Theo was alive. 

Marienne does not seem like a good match for Joe at all. He’s honestly so dumb for being obsessed with her. They’re not alike. If she were to find out about his cage or that he killed Ryan, it doesn’t matter if she said she’s glad he’s dead, I have no doubt that she would be horrified and would want nothing to do with him anymore.
So do we think that Love’s mother knew that Joe would kill Love? I feel like it seems that way and they took the show in that direction to give viewers the realization that Love is the way she is because her mother is the same.
I really enjoyed this season because of the dynamic between Love and Joe. With the way it ended I’m not overly excited for season 4 as I don’t want to revert back to season 1/early season 2 of it being all about Joe being a stalker.

In saying that, I went into season 3 with the same expectation and then Natalie died. But with Love out the picture I don’t know how it’s going to look now. I just hope they do something to make it fresh because I’m tired of Joe’s inner monologues justifying the new obsessions. Plus the fact that we can assume he’s most likely going to be the only one returning next season (aside from Marianne probably) I just don’t know how they’re going to make it compelling
The music for this season is absolutely on point. From the song playing during Natalie’s vigil to the very end, all of the song choices are perfect
Who else wants all the surviving cast members from previous seasons to team up and kill Joe? ✋ The tech guy could track Joe somehow, Marianne could help draw Joe out, along with the young girl from S2, Sherry/Carey and Love’s Mom. I think this could be a very good idea for a final season. Joe can finally get what’s coming to him, but it’s going to take everyone to bring him down.
People are upset that Love gets killed off, but the whole killing thing every times she’s jealous or is frustrated would get tired and would seem like there was no justice serviced. Either Joe or love had to die and being that Joe is the main protagonists and is slightly less unhinged compared to Love he’d survive. I think the show will eventually end for Joe badly meeting his fate, but I don’t see how another season of Joe and Love together as a married couple pretending to be normal whilst continuously murdering people wouldn’t become repetitive.
I might be over thinking but is someone watching Joe? I’m not sure if the way certain scenes are just filmed but especially scenes in the library with Joe it looks a bit blurry around the scene. Idk makes me feel like it’s being seen through someone else’s eyes.
I mean I can't be the only one who thinks Joe doesn't actually have feelings for Marianne...


He was just using her as an excuse to get away from Love
I just finished the last episode and I literally have no words lmfao I did not expect that ending!! Does anyone believe love might have somehow escaped? Or do you guys think we’re done with her?
Way too much on-the-nose modern trends and terminology that the community of people felt like a caricature ... but I guess that was the point

Also, why are they so cool with showing dismemberment and gore but have people fully clothed for sex scenes
I would rather fuck a cactus
OMG I just finished this.

How do these showrunners continue to deliver amazing seasons one after another?  Kudos to them! A few random thoughts:

* I adored this season. I'm still partial to season 1 as my favorite (I have my reasons), but this one was right there with it.
* I am SO going to miss Victoria Pedretti. She was MADE for this role. SO fucking perfect for it. I'm sure they will cast well for S4 (I missed the hell out of Elizabeth Lail initially too) but i will miss Pedretti a ton.
* Personal, non-logical concern but wanted to share. I always thought that the Bonnie and Clyde dysfunction of Love and Joe was inevitable to flame out...but...i also feared that if/when it did, it was going to be really hard to go back. I don't know that I am going to feel the same about the character to be able to just watch him go back to season 1/2 type antics. Maybe I will but I dont know.
* That sex scene with Cary and Sherry so so well done. Equal parts hilarious, awkward, and uncomfortable (with a touch of horrifying).
* I didn't love the fit of Theo in the plot. I honestly feel like he came across at the beginning as a 19 year old neophyte and by the end was playing as a 25 year old (there's a big difference).
* **How do the writers convince my heart to break at the dissolution of a marriage between two sociopaths?**

I have a million more takeaways I imagine but i just finished it an hour ago so I will need to process.

All told though, man so so good. But I feel very similarly at end the of this season that I did after season one. Like I just watched something special, but also a gut punch in both mourning the loss of an actor I thought was amazing to watch and also the lack of clarity of what the future of the show can be.
I so desperately wanted Love to “kill” Joe and have the next season be her story…until we’re completely caught off guard in the middle of it & find out Joe is actually alive & tracks her down. Also, they shouldn’t have killed off Forty in the second season. ALSO, where is Ellie? We needed more of them! I stupidly want more of Sherry and Cary…I sort of liked them towards the end. Can we also talk about how Marienne’s daughter didn’t like Joe? Her intuition is so much stronger than her mothers. Ah I’m experiencing so many emotions after finishing the entire season in less than 2 days 😭 I wonder how the story will continue with Henry??? I hope they don’t kill Dante off in the next season…but I guess that’s kind of the premise of “You.”
I had wished the ending went differently honestly and they ended it with this season. It was great and Love was and amazing character. I hope he doesnt get away in season 4 or things catch up to him somehow
that ending was some real silence of the lambs shit
I felt like here were so many problems with this season. It started out strong then devolved into season 1 all over again. I thought they created too many convenient plot devices, and I was particularly annoyed by the “I’ll just fake my death” a la Harry potters scabbers. So la y Cha bracketed were throw away, yet had too much screen time and then others who actually affects the plot were tied up so quickly. I felt it was unsatisfying, though I did binge the whole seasons. Perhaps with more time between episodes it wouldnt have been as visible.
Joe is so far gone.
Looking forward to season 4. Anyone have any interesting predictions?
I think it would be crazy if love pulled a Micheal Meyers and somehow got out of the fire alive lol.
Was anyone else wondering who was watching the baby most of the time??
She killed many people for Joe but he didn’t kill anyone for her. Am I right? I forgot season 2 after watching season 3 Lol
Folk hero, more famous even than Guinevere Beck!
Why isn’t Love on some sort of medication? Like if she can’t control her emotions to the point of murdering multiple. Obviously, they both have mental illnesses. I’ve really liked the show but her flipping out and screaming she killed Natalie so Sherry and Cary could hear really ruined the show for me. I’m honestly irritated. I hope that’s what the show was going for at least.
I have a feeling we will be seeing Victoria next season- maybe Love will “haunt” Joe
I honestly enjoyed season 3 more than season 2. Season 2 was ver boring in the beginning and got better at the end. Season 3 I actually became invested in Joe. I wanted love out, she was very impulsive and possessive .  I felt like joe didn’t really want to kill people this season
Love was the best part of the show. She stole every scene she was in. I would have kept her around for longer. Lots of options there for interesting story lines. Honestly they filled 3 seasons worth of Love drama into one season. 

Also it was clear the writers of this show didn't have kids. No way that would fly. Also leaving your kid with a stranger unannounced for an overnight. Would never happen.
I’m so sad that Love & Joe didn’t work out. They seemed so perfect for each other, but they really did bring out each other’s worst. And unfortunately, given their unhinged nature, their *worst* had a body count.
Do you think love is actually dead? How can they pull off a season 4? Like If love is truly dead then be done. They could’ve ended the show as is. 

Anyone else think love pulled out of it and also thought ahead and took some “adrenaline” before hand just incase joe pulled some shit? Maybe it will turn out like Candace and Love got out of the house fire before it burned up. 

I don’t know but I don’t see much happening for a season 4 if love is truly dead
This was a very good season its actually a tie between season 1 and season 3 with me.  Outside of cheating Joe actually wanted to be a good guy which is the crazy part.
I love how with this season, Love is the one that causes all the problems cuz she can’t control herself 😂😂. Like joe was on his best behavior.
I hoped that Joe would come to respect Love more this season and that she wouldn’t have constantly killed people, got sensitive when called impulsive and left Joe to deal with the bodies, like with Delilah. 
Lowkey hoped for the let’s be serial killers ending
„Oh shit. Love is going to kill you“. So many good one liners in this season. I was cracking up all the time, especially that hunting trip.
Why isn't Love's Dad in season 3?
Y’all I heard what will happen next season: Joe will be completely broke with no money and compete in a French Squid Games!
Finally finished season 3 and I really really hope to see Victoria again. Would love to see her come back kinda like Candace or a totally different role.
I still cant get over the use of Taylor Swift's Exile tbh
I honestly don’t even know how to feel right now. Love AND Joe were the worst for different reasons, and I’m torn between feeling pity and disgust for them right now. 😭😭😭 the ACTING thoooooooo. Penn’s acting as Joe is chef’s kiss. He plays joe as he his…and I feel with season 3 it is harder to justify Joe’s character. You see his true self, as it always was. And Victoria pedretti…no words. I’m still all over the place and I feel like I need time to process everything. This show, besides all hype drama and thriller tendencies, is disturbing and really makes me think, and I do love it for that.
I really want a whole season dedicated to Love and Joe trying to take each other out.
I have to say, this may be my favorite season yet. I loved the dynamic between Love and Joe and I think it added so much more to the show to have another crazy person in the mix that Joe needed to keep in check.
am i the only one who thinks that joe felt guilty what he did to candace while we he was with beck and he recalled what he did on his childhood killing his dad for his mom while he was pursuing love and then he recalled his teacher in his childhood while he was hitting on marrienne
I loved their little easter eggs, I noticed that Henry's car seat colour is actually called Henry
the end of s3 is crazy the way he leaves everything and everyone for a women he can’t even find, that’s Joe for you.
Ok so I need answers lol. In You season 3 I get the impression that Sherry and Cary found out obviously about Joe killing Natalie. But I’m so confused about HOw and why sherry was asking for Joe and Love to come back into bed? I was weirded out when she stood up from the bed I thought she was like gonna get impregnated with Joes sperm because of how she was holding her belly, lol. then I thought she used his sperm maybe for DNA to accuse them? 

Can someone please explain Like how did they find out
I have asked friends and family about this and they have no idea... but anyone know why Sherry was rubbing on her stomach after her and her husband found out Love killed Natalie? The camera focused specifically on her stomach area. I know it was awkward/uncomfortable body language, but anything more than that?
I started first episode on Friday; now up to date.

Incredible show.  Second season favourite for me. 

I liked the dynamic this season; interesting with the double psycho pivot
The only real good guy this season is Matthew.
The double cheating potline is so annoying to me..like you both murder people for fun and you can't tell each other your having affairs?😂😂 
Idk this season was good but also the cheating plot gets old to me really quickly.
How does Joe have money to “look all over the world” for merianne?
I really loved that they brought Forty back, even as Love's hallucination. So sad and sweet. I absolutely loved Theo, but felt bad for him. He was misguided and should've been raised better IMO. Horny teen boy just trying to find love with Love unfortunately. Was so happy when Joe ended saving him! Very happy about Love's death but also I loved her character even though she was a sociopathic murderer. I can't wait for next season!
#spoiler Tesla 
>!on season 3 ep 2 but the Tesla has cameras and surely they will sync and show Joe loading  the body!<
Season 4 theory… if you remember back to season 1 peach and beck were ment to go to Paris but joe then kills peach, yet at the end of season 3 joe goes to Paris, also in season 2 where love locks joe in with Delilah joes has a thought about what beck would have done and he even says that she pretended to love him, so did joe really love love? Or did love just love joe? I think beck will re appear this new season as when she tried to escape we only saw joe drag her back down the stairs, the body he then come to bury could of been the pacos step father, I could obviously be wrong and missed bits and pieces but I do think beck could return this season :)
When Sherry grabbed Joe’s chest hair tho
I'm not a tech whiz or anything but can someone explain to me why Matthew could access all the cameras in Madre Linda(Love even ripped out their doorbell camera) but not access the camera of the baby monitor they put for the glass cage? It's been bugging me for weeeks!
I was heartbroken at the...
Honestly y’all I watched all of these episodes with my SO and it felt like I was getting warning signs based on the emotional roller coaster Joe and love have going on reminded me of the one myself and her had going. Needless to say I believe it made us more in tune with our toxic traits and learning when they are ongoing to be acknowledged.
I’ve loved every season, but I felt like this was a perfect ending for the series. Not sure if I want there to be another season
In episode 10, when Love picked up Henry and Joe got home to find her making a roast for dinner and saying that Henry was quietly sleeping in another room, did anyone else get a mini panic thinking Love had cooked Henry and was going to try to trick Joe into eating him? BIG sigh of relief when she popped a chicken on the table
I think it was really creepy how oe and love could do the worst things and carry on like everything Is normal. Like when Love was thinking about baby names. And when joe was jumping for joy while on the phone with Marianne while holding a shovel with Theo’s body wrapped in a trap next to him. I think it illustrated their sickness really well.
Why was Love advocating so hard for her and Joe to play with Cary and Sherry?
I don’t feel like her motivations were very clear, or maybe I missed it.
Finally finished Season 3

All I can say is creepy and disturbing
quick question: so if joe took the antidote in the final episode, was he faking his being on the floor or did it make the poison's effects just wear off faster than it was supposed to?
It took 10 episodes, but I'm a Sherry and Cary stan now. They were the best thing about this season.
All I gotta say is: >!fuck Joe. Love gave her all trying to be a good wife/mother while he was busy planning his escape and making her feel like she was crazy. I really empathized with Love this season. So sad they killed her off. !<
rip love. you were insane. but so fun to watch.
Am I the only person who thought this was their favorite season?? Everyone here seems to be bashing it but I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! I loved the parallels between joe and love and hated some characters like Theo, but that didn’t make me hate the show. I interpreted it as a character we are supposed to hate because joe is the protagonist of the show
I think the wrong Quinn-Goldberg died. It would have been more interesting to see the show shift to Love's perspective and inner monologue. Joe's obsession schtick is getting old - and Love's the more nuanced and complex character.
Any fans of YOU would probably love Mindhunters too. I highly recommend it.
I just finished the 3 season and I started it from the second (Skipped 1st one). I love the series and it one of the shows I been waiting from Netflix.

Holy shit, never seen something so good for a long time, I thought maybe the new season may suck but it was amazing....

Love's death was pretty sad tho :(
[deleted]
Just finished the whole series. Absolutely brilliant. Glad there’s going to be a fourth season.
“Gonna need more tarp” was a great line.
Honestly this was a hard to watch season, not because it's badly written or anything, but because at this point it just seems like a bunch of patterns repeating ,and I have trouble being on board for yet another season of Joe staking someone when I know he'll get bored eventually and just move on. Granted many people are like that, and marriages usually end in divorce, but still, for all this talk about betterment and effort in making this work, Joe's heart was simply not into it from the very beginning, which made the whole season really hard to watch. There was something endearing about seeing Joe try to better himself over time , and finally finding someone that could deliver him from his abandonment issues and obsession with stalking... Seeing both of them trying so hard to keep their marriage afloat, only for it to end in such a disappointing way. Not sure the show can recover.

Like it or not, I think the Joe and Love relationship was special. It's hard to think any relationship could compete with that one in the long run, and it's even less likely that he could find someone again that would understand and accept him for what he is. The fact he could not appreciate it and spent pretty much then entire season obsessing over random girl in his circle he could not have and had very little in common with him was infuriating, plus seeing that resentment about his wife from having done bad things, even though he's just as bad, if not worse...

I also feels all the character growth is now gone... After season 1, it felt Joe was starting to work out some of his issue, and season 2 gave the audience hope that if he could find someone that truly understood him, but after a full season of seeing him only care about new girls to stalk , whatever sympathy we could have for the character is all but extinguished... Honestly I think they probably should have ended the show after that season, maybe with both lovers killing themselves, but I'm just not looking forward to another cycle of Joe acting like a creeper and stalking yet another poor, nice girl, or them trying to one up Love, which I doubt they will ever accomplish... Best to call in quits before it becomes a caricature. I'll suppose they will play the card of "she was always going to kill , I had to get out of this relationship, i'm the good guy"... But we don't believe it anymore... Not after all of this...
Exile by swift couldn’t have been a more perfect song for that ending
After Love knocked Gil out, did anyone else think "GIRLLLL, STOP IT! OMG!" LOL!
The final episode was very *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*
I’m sorry, but am I the only one who thought this season should’ve not been created, let alone a confirmation for a 4th one? This entire season was a recycled mess from the last two and it’s completely predictable. Even the last scene where Joe is in another country is something I predicted earlier in the season.
[deleted]
One thing I didn’t like is that, since the ending of the 2nd season and most of the third, joe lost all his morals. He used to kill because he thought he was doing the “right thing”.. but he seems to kill only for personal gain at some point. He does seem to get some of those morals back at some point, like helping leo. But overall he slowly transitioned to just a straight up serial murderer for almost no good reason
[deleted]
I was not totally on the YOU train the first two seasons but totally loved the third season. anybody else think the third season was the best of the lot?
The story they cooked up with Gill and Natalie was too far fetched, I wonder how did the investigators closed the case just with a suicide note from Gill saying he had an affair with Natalie? Makes no sense to me
Might just be me, but I hated Marianne. Just seemed like a hollow character with a forced emotional arc later to justify Joe's obsession with her. (Which, like... why???)
>!Honestly I think they are both such fucked up people, but at the end I felt bad for Love.!<

>!I hated her THE WHOLE TIME, until she actually came out with who she was, what she did, and why she did it.!<

>!Still a murdering psychopath but she gets number 2 as most evil. Right after them 2, is the couple locked in the cage. Disgusting.!<
I binged all three seasons in the past few weeks - I reaally am looking forward to what season 4 will be like, I know if they return to the formula of season 1 it will be boring but considering how different and how more unexpected the events have steadily tracked through season 2 and season 3, I'm genuinely hopeful.

This has put me through an emotional wringer. My opinions on characters have gone so distorted it's a mindflip and such an enjoyable one. I do hate the choice of what they did with Henry even though it's realistic and what's best for him, the dynamic between father and son would've been nice.
Joe is going to>!Paris, France!<now...this should be \*very\* interesting.

Also fuck me I just started studying the language not long before watching the finale. How ironic hahah.
Honestly I’d be happy if season 4 ended up being based around love’s perspective going forward. Would much rather see things from her point of view as it seems her and Joe are just as insane but in different ways. Would definitely prevent the show from dying on repetition.
Dumb question, we shouldn't expect to see Ellie again right?
Liked this season way better than season 2. I was ready to drop this show if it didn't get better. This season kept me on my toes for sure. Cheesy? yeah. Ridcoulous? Of course. But its good dumb for me.
Just finished Season 3, and holy shit what a last couple of episodes
I thought the “4YOU YOU4” trailer was pretty cool and well edited together
Cause of Theo I stopped watching. What an annoying twat. Stopped at episode 6. S2 was okay but S1 was definitely the best. Wont be watching S4. Up to the next show!
Why didn't they shoot Love using the airholes? I guess they'd be stuck inside but she'd be dead at least.
So relieved that Theo and those two in the cage managed to survive!
Just for the record >!idk I just want to try it!<
Is Love supposed to be a likeable character? Because I can't stand her. All I wanted all season was for Joe to just kill her and live happily with Marienne.
I thought Beck was hot, Love is hooot with her attitude this season. I think I like toxic women 👀 😁 😂
Why are the nitrates so crappy? 0.85mbps on some episodes? Seriously Netflix
I really don’t get the love for the show. 

First season was good
Second average
Third very sub par

The writing is lazy. The characters aren’t likeable or beliveable. I just don’t get the point to it. 

Each season seems to introduce numerous major plot points (pee jar and PI in season 1, Elly at the end of season 2 etc) that they just ignore later on. It’s terrible writing and does nothing to further the show 

I’m all for suspending disbelief, however the show seems to want to appeal to the realism of the set up. It’s idiotic to try and make a show realistic, but expect viewers to also treat it as completely unbelievable in parts

Started out strong. But has ended up being a dumpster fire of a series.
Cutting off his toes was just damn weird.
>!deleted!<
I haven’t read any other comments and this is my first post but honestly, I think this was a terrible season. It got so absurd with everything going on. Joe confesses to killing his moms bf then a few days later the new ‘You’s ex husband is stabbed to death. Love admits Joe killed people etc and she just leaves with her kid? Doesn’t report anyone or anything. The show was just awful this season.
I don’t know if this is true but I noticed that when Joe kills he wears w bite shirt and idk and can’t remember if he did earlier in the series but I vaguely remember him wearing white, could that be because he sees himself as like a white knight for those he falls in love with?
I think if there will be a season 4 (don't know if it's been confirmed or not), and if Marienne will be present, they might play it like a more "traditional" stalker situation - Joe does his thing and Marienne lives in fear and tries to keep him away. I don't think he can undo what Love told her about him. If they go that route, I hope Marienne will get a happy ending.
Oof just watched the ending. Damn.
Does anyone know the episode which he buys books as “flowers” bc the titles of the books all have flower names? Or was it a past season
Hated sherry in the beginning and ended up loving sherry and carry by the end. Low key hope they have them show up in season 4…maybe even have peach end up surviving from season 1 and show up to one of their Ted talks 😂I’d kinda love those three together
Man I like this thread, but I couldn’t deal with love’s antics. She was way too impulsive, killing any and every body over little shit, screaming about murder in front of guests in earshot, or even casually talking about murdering people hypothetically. Don’t get it twisted I liked the rain scene when love questions how joe, with his hyper-competence at covering up murders, as well as his barely present “moral code”, could possibly judge her as a murderer. Joe was definitely a hypocrite l get that, but still She was a danger, not just to her family but to all of society.
anyone else notice joe gave a note to a blind guy
the ending is exactly what i expected so i was disappointed by that. joe planned to kill love in the 1st episode
So the killer is just Joe, he went batshit crazy, after actually killing Marienne in the first episode and some Fight Club shit is happening before our eyes.
Anyone else noticed this weird mistake in S03EP09?
It happens after Marianne tells Joe that she's going to follow her daughter to New Jersey. As he says "I'm going to lose you" (as part of his inner monologue), his eyelid changes the slightest bit. It looks kinda like when you try on a TikTok filter and it takes a second to adjust to your face...What is happening? Anyone has any ideas?
I know I’m late but I just finished the season! Wasn’t my favorite but there’s one thing that drove me nuts… 

Did anyone notice that the bakery and the cage and everything opened so impossibly fast when paired with the disappearance of Natalie? I mean there’s no way that could have happened so fast and been up and running!! I’ve been trying to find someone else who has the same thoughts :)
ik im really late to watching this lol but i was really confused about what joe and love did with the conrad’s car after they took them to the bakery and put them in the cage
What a good pickup
Branching off of this, if she cooks when she’s happy, maybe that’s why she cooked the chicken in the final episode… >! happy that she was about to end Joe’s life !<
also what happened to that tight group of friends of hers? did she fool them all? are they still friends? they just disappeared.
That's very good. I was thinking about how she barely cooked this season even though that seemed more her forte in season 2.
The detail here! Wow wow impressed 👏👏

But wait why is everyone Keto lmao & aren’t raspberries pretty low in sugar? I know it’s supposed to be dramatic but what
Do you reckon it's coz living in the suburbs is so simple and dull, it stresses them out because how boring it is?
I didnt even pick up on that
I forgot about that.... good call. I noticed though she got it all set up like, really quickly? When it opens she says "Natalie had been missing for 3 days"
She was stressed since the end of season 2. The only thing that saved her was being pregnant
Wasnt she stressed through the season though ?
I said the same thing when I was watching this season!! I couldn't tell if it was a plot whole or if it was intentional. Probably intentional knowing this show
I noticed that. I thought maybe it was some kind of metaphor for the fact that she wasn’t really happy, and to show how much she had changed. She stayed in madre Lind basking in her own unhappiness for the good of her family and the place swayed her personality a bit. To me it meant like, this is just her life and she’s dealing with it, hence the unhappy baking business
This is definitely a good observation! Also though when she decided to open the bakery she was under a lot of stress because she’d just found Joe’s Natalie box, and then killed Natalie, and then was worried about the cover up. She was basically stressed out the whole season, so it does add up.
Good catch!
Well spotted!
Totally missed that
Ohhh! Good point, I forgot about that!
isn't that ironic, she cooked right before she was going to kill Joe?
It was hard to escalate from that, so they chose formula instead sadly
I almost thought Love just knocked her out for a min when it happened because I couldn’t believe she was already gone
Yeah... at the beginning of the first episode, it seemed like Natalie could be manipulative and have similar "tactics/social engineering skills" as Joe. I was imagining that she would have elaborate plans especially given her connections and the tech at her disposal.
I KNOW, I really liked her character and thought they could've done more with her. Love is getting on my nerves which is unfortunate cause I really liked her in season 2.
Great point, but I'm actually kinda happy about that because it would've been a repeat of season 1,2. I think they've could've done more with the death becaause it was very unrealistic how they got away with it.
[deleted]
I was so happy she was, honestly. I was so mad during the first episode watching Joe do that right off the bat and then Love comes in and just takes her out. Very impressed lol
I was glad. I spent the first half of the episode  complaining to my husband that I'm sick of each season focusing on a new woman and abandoning the characters from the previous season. Glad we (mostly) got another season with Love.
The directors said that's precisely why they had to kill her off. They knew the audience would be expecting a lot of story with her and they wanted to make sure the story was unexpected lol
I think part of Love’s shtick is that she kills people impulsively. All of her killings shocked me. I actually screamed out loud when she struck Gil!
I thought natalie was going to be just like joe and love.. you know since she always knows when joe is watching
I thought that was hilarious. Just jumping right into it.
Ugh I looked the actress up on IMDB and saw she only appeared in one episode
Same here.  I haven’t read the books but I thought Natalie was going to be one of the main new characters this season.
They did such a great job with breaking the formula by having her be a red herring
i suspect so when she was led to the basement, good pacing
Right I expected the entire season to be about her lmao
I thought it was a great plot twist when we've been expecting her to be the love interest of the entire season since the finale of season 2.
Same , Love came out swinging in season 3 .
When I saw that in the trailer I was like well. Joe stalking another woman for an entire season looks kinda boring to me. Well, they did it right
I was like no way….? It’s her imagination! But then I was like oh lmao should’ve known these two are psychos!
Kinda obvious cause they had to make way for a token black character.
Lol yeah it kind of reminded me of Avengers: Endgame when they killed Thanos right in the beginning and then made the main plot about time travel. The writers just wanted to add extra plot twists and shock people to keep the audience on their toes. It actually kind of annoyed me when they killed her so fast because they were just doing it for suspense...
Right?! I was already calling that she was an undercover cop and they were on Joe’s trail for beck 😂😂 but nope!!
I was cool with Natalie dying so quickly only because the trailer was all about her, so I liked that it only covered the first two episodes and was a misdirect with what the rest of the season would be about.
hated that she was killed off so quick...
Exactly. I still kept telling myself no this can't happen, they're in their subconscious. This won't happen. This would take an entire season to plan and execute. But nope. Got real quite fast.
Same omg
it’s the writer’s go-to plot point. murdering. and falling in love. rinse, repeat.
The actress was pregnant.
Me either.
Still don't get why everyone is suprised I thought it was obvious it was going to happen
I thought so toooo! I was shocked!
me neither lmao
Right! 0 to 100 real quick.
I wasn't expecting the killing spree to start so soon and just went on and on. The body count this season was insane. I guess some people who we thought were going to die didn't but it was one assault after another with them
Stupid she killed her...made the show less real ruined it, another dumped show because of poor writing.
The delivery of “don’t get hysterical, I took a seminar” -bang- from Sherry had me in stitches.
"killed" being the theme of the show.
"Oh shit, love is going to kill you". Cracked up so hard
Exactly I was like, " sis you just killed someone". This shows that she doesn't give a fuck, she just wants to be with Joe no matter what. 

Bummer, she died in the end. She was perfect for Joe. Ig he lost interest in her when he saw her true Self.
It was her reaction to getting shot in the ear for me 💀
That line and "Oh shit, Love's gonna kill you" had me laughing in tears.
This was soo cringe I couldn’t stand it
Same! I don't like that the show plays into the misogynistic storyline of having the woman be irrational while the man is supposedly more rational, but Love's level of craziness to believe that a murder and theraphy will fix their problems was hilarious.
Do they explain at any point where Joe gets his money from?? I keep forgetting.

Man works with books for a living and lives in the most expensive cities

Edit: he stole books and sold them
Ah that's so poignant. I guess when Ellie sees the news about Love being a murderer and her killing Joe, she will just assume Joe can't send her money cos he's dead
I thought for sure she was coming back this season for revenge
I was thinking that shes 17 turning 18 by the time Joe disappears so I dont think she really needs him anymore
or how about for large chunks at a time it's just an afterthought that Henry exists. Aside from here and there to tell us that Henry was down for the night or settled down, they'd operate as if he didn't exist
I’m kinda worried about Ellie she’s so.. gullible considering she was drugged by that guy and wouldn’t listen to Delilah or anyone. I wish we could see what she’s up to.
Unless he falls in love with her next season, she should be 18 by then.
:(((
Omg, great point! I (like Joe) totally forgot l!
At least she may get some comfort from his 'death'.
Told my partner I need 24 hours to binge this show. 

He didn't know how much it would affect me emotionally. Opps.
Life Hack: Emotional whiplash is the best way to go to bed bc your brain doesnt have time to process everything so it can just go night night
Omg feel you. And my stupid ass is all over Twitter explaining that love was not crazy , she was mentally ill and abused plus manipulated . Yes she is impulsive yes she killed people But joe out there pretending to be dexter 2.0 like his murders weren’t cruel and horrifying is so lame. He is a psychopath and a creep he never got over the fact his mother left him and that’s why he hates and hunts women
Why are all these women falling in love with the creepy Joe.. even when he is married and has a fucking child he gets the woman he loves. 
Penn Badgley is extremely charismatic but I felt this season belonged to Victoria. I was hoping she wakes up in the end and kills Joe, becoming the main psycho next season 😂
I just finished and I'm still trying to process what happened lol
I know Love was evil in her own way but I still feel really bad for her
It really was. I took the story really seriously lol.  I was upset when Love and Theo had a thing because I actually really like her and Joe together.  Same with Joe cheating.  It seemed inevitable it was going to end like it did but I really hated seeing it.  I don’t know why but I was just really invested in them as a couple. And then him having to leave the baby really sucked too.
I agree. My heart hurts 😞 

I don’t particularly have a special affection for kids like many people do, but watching >!child Joe and his child friend in a group home long for their mothers to come back for them, only for Joe to lose the counselor (another mother figure) and witness his own mother moving on with another child!< KILLED me. And then watching how much it pained him to >!give up Henry (to a loving family) so he wouldn’t grow up with a serial killer father or grow up in the system!< was just the cherry on top. I know Joe is not a good person, maybe even clinically insane, but it truly broke my heart to see the abandonment he experienced and how important it was to him that his son not go through the same and turn out a monster like him. Just so much childhood abandonment, abuse, and neglect to unpack in one season 😭
Me too!!! I had the most profound moment with my fiancé after watching this season. I just want to take care of him and thank my lucky stars he is such a wonderful partner and human being. Nothing like a toxic af show to remind you how lucky you are to land a giant green flag!
Feel no shame, friend, this is not the show that’s meant to be forgotten about until the next episode comes out a week later.
This. I also binged and now need to watch some cartoons to detox lol
Also I won’t be eating any pie or roast chicken for a while.

I just made this exact same mistake and I can say that I definitely have whiplash from it.
right. makes me want to rewatch the whole show at my own pace.
Wow… just finish s3 and can’t sleep because it was too emotional ending. I keep rewinding the whole shows in my mind to have a catch on Joe life. 

This show really change my point of view on life matter, like parent and family issues. We all see something from our life in here even when we kill no one. 

S1-S3 for me, is like going from first love to married one. And many issues hit the box. Including how we fake happiness, want to runaway, being cheated, stuck with a toxic relationship/life…

So many ongoing that sometimes I respect how each character can have enough courage to kill for love. But still not brave enough to tell the truth about what they think about their relationship and how they can no longer save it from falling apart. 

Somehow I feel like we are not naturally born to live in a marriage.
Me too 😅 I'm so pissed off honestly it is wild
Took me a few days (I do see that your comment is 23 days old and I started watching on day 1 lol) because it was really stressful. Normally shows don't affect me like that but the normal problems he was facing were too real, opposite of the almost comical "always getting away with every crime" thing. His marriage problems were relateable and so is his anxiety and general mental state. Other than the whole... ya know, murdering people thing.
dude exactly and not just that but it showed such a realistic view (apart from killing lol) on marriage
Lmao yes
Yeah I watched it across like… a month? And I’m really satisfied not gonna lie
The most I ever watch in one day is 3-4 episodes.
Binging all 10 episodes in one day just ruins it
Dude.  Watching this, I saw so MANY patterns that my ex and I had! Thankfully that’s over.
I felt the same after getting to ep 6 of squid games. Said to myself i gotta finish " YOU." I turn it on and star is forcing sherrie and her husband to try and kill each other.
But is he a purple flag?
Hahaha same here!!!
[removed]
Same with Sherry's friends after that 6-month time jump. They disappear and only come back in the last episode.... and then for some reason we get a voiceover on their new business and their baby Toxi?? Why would we care about them when the show gave up on them after episode 4?
just came back to emphasize lmao. Like idk how they’d fit, but I definitely would’ve liked to see them mentioned
I think it was good because it played into the desperation and isolation of living in the burbs
I feel like they do this alot throughout the series! We get introduced to all these characters to further the plot, but then they get forgotten and we never hear from them again?

Joe’s whole game in Season 2 was about protecting Ellie…then he leaves and aside from sending her money once, we never hear about it again, not to mention the ending. What happened to the bookstore from Season 1? What about the P.I. that was investigating him, and the jar of pee? What happened to Love’s friends from Season 2? So many loose ends!
i was wondering the same thing. i guess she fooled them all because they seemed to have no clue she was a psycho. there’s so many characters that just disappear into the ether. that’s why i’m over this show, there’s little character development beyond joe and love and even that is stagnant a lot this season.
They, especially Love moved to that town specifically to start over that’s why her friends weren’t really in this season, plus love only actually cared about her new life than anything
Yes that’s weird but the whole point of this season was that they’re getting a fresh start, hence the name of loves bakery. Sometimes moving and having a fresh start includes becoming estranged with old friends
Love mentioned them to Natalie in the first episode after she overheard Sherry talking about Anavrin/Forty, and Natalie told her that she needed to make new friends in Madre Linda
Season 3 characters were a huge disappointment after Season 2. The only new characters I actually liked were Dante and Theo. Things have gotten boring, and I have no interest whatsoever in Marianne.
[deleted]
Yeah I thought this was odd too. They were so close, they would definitely have pushed to come to visit. It seems odd she would just never mention them. They'd be batting down her front door right? Maybe it was a sign of how she was trying so hard to fit into suburbia and be this perfect family, leaving them behind.
She wanted a fresh start, so I assumed she cut everyone off except her mum
Because the writing for this show is actual garbage, its one of those hate watch shows
I was wondering!!!
She moved. That can put a strain on friendships.
And I love that Marienne's ex totally called him out on it. Like "I've seen you lurking at the back of meetings." Joe thinks he's so much better that this than he is.
Reminded me of Maeve's mom in Sex Education S3: "You always wear a hat when you're doing something dodgy"
Since COVID got referenced on the early episodes, I wonder why he didn't use a mask to conceal his face better. He only thought of that idea when he's trailing Ryan.
Dude literally murders people WITH NO GLOVES! It does my head in.
It's like Superman when he puts on his glasses
The way he just awkwardly stands by in the library to eavesdrop on people talking, but he’s clearly visible and obvious. Why didn’t they make it so he had AirPods and set up little mics in the library? Would have brought the creepiness up more, and made himself as a character not seem like an idiot. Even ryan says something about it to him, like “you think you’re hiding but I see you standing by”. It’s like Joe isn’t aware of people’s peripheral vision. I would laugh at those scenes (and various moments throughout the season) because they were poorly thought out or just lazily written
The perfect disguise lol
The ol' assassin's creed hood technique when it actually makes you look more suspicious
He was practicing to join the Avengers in season 4.
Insert Wake up punch from that news anchor douche lol
His stalking disguise is the worst
That blue dress she wore to that event at the library.... I've been thinking about it for days now!
[deleted]
I want her entire wardrobe from this season. But only Victoria could make it look 👌
Yes I loved her wardrobe!  I liked a lot of Marienne's clothes too.
She’ll never tell you where she got her clothes from, it’s victoria’s secret
Love's season 3 outfits>>>> Love's season 2 outfits.
There are several tops Love wore that I am still thinking about days later. I must find them.
Here you go! http://www.femestella.com/netflix-you-season-3-where-to-get-love-quinns-outfits/
Her outfit and hair was stunning! Along with Sherry and Marianne’s costumes.
i want everything.
Agreed! She looked great this season! This was Succession level styling! Wow!!
She's stunning. She always dies in her roles. But that's okay. I can fix her.
YESSS I seriously loves all her outfits, and jewelery and hair styles!!!!
She looked gorgeous this season
Yes!  Her whole look in the final episode was so simple but so perfect.  That button henley and jeans looked amazing on her figure, and hair/make-up was on point.
Her hair was also amazing, she was so beautiful
nah Marrienne's clothes were better. Her mature ones, not the teenager ones she sometimes wore
was literally coming here to say this - i was so excited for each new fit.
One hundred percent!! I was like… I really like her whole wardrobe. I want that style!
Me and my friend couldn’t stop talking about how on point every single outfit she wore was
I can't stop thinking about the coveralls
I loved the way Victoria rocked  those clothes too!!
Lol same! I was tearing up when I thought Cary was dying
Because when put in such a real situation, they let down their facade and their own flaws showed through. Hence, they felt more like real people with real issues that us viewers suddenly felt sympathy for.
I liked Cary a lot after the hike/camp night. He added a nice light-heartedness to the whole season for me, and him and Joe’s dynamic with Joe’s internal monologue was great. Sherry rubbed off on me, eventually. So happy they made it out
I had the same reaction haha. I think it's because in the cage they were real. They weren't these obnoxious caricatures any more.
One thing I like in this show is how you see the horror and pain that the victims experience (where usually in tv/movies if the main character is the one doing the killing, it's usually written that the victims don't feel pain and don't have personal experiences at all), but I feel like this season took a step further. The victims are all really humanized as complex beings with both good and bad traits and both Joe and Love had to be constantly faced with that.
Sameee. The scene in the woods with Sherry leading the search party.. I hated her so much. I thought for sure she would get killed at some point and I would not be sad about it. But I’m so glad she didn’t! I was really happy they got out.
pls sherry & cary CARRYD this season
I was thinking though, it wouldn't have mattered whether Sherry and Cary found the key. Joe burned down the house, Love died and people would have gone to the bakery soon enough and discover them in the basement, right? The only thing I can think of is that Cary's injury was so bad that he would have died from blood loss if they didn't make it out in time.
Yeah, at first I honestly didn’t care if they died in the beginning of the season. This is mostly because their relationship seemed so fake to me. But you really realized how strong their marriage actually was towards the end and learned more about their love story (for a brief moment).
It's a basic writer's trope called a "redemption arc." They wrote them to be unlikable, then simply adjusted the narrative and made them say and act likeable. Personally I found it to be weak writing.
Same. I liked them by the end and tbh even though they weren’t great ppl at the beginning they didn’t do anything that warranted their deaths so I was happy they escaped
SAME! I went from disliking Sherry, to finding the two of them funny after the time jump. To genuinely hoping they survive.
The people irritated me the most (that included Theo) got to live. And I'm very happy for them.
Hated this. They were HORRIBLE people. Like, despicable. But suddenly the last episode writers wanted to turn them into human beings. I was rooting for them to die, not sorry. Fake, rude, cruel, shallow.
Omg yes lol for a while I was like, omg please frame Sherry! And then at the end I was like crying when Sherry and Cary were telling each other what made them fall in love with each other. Ugh. I was rooting for them at that point lol
The charm and chemistry that Penn & Vic have on-screen is definitely to blame. I remember telling someone this weekend that I wouldn’t mind watching them play house for 10 episodes straight.
THE WAY I FELT THISSSSS
Hahaha somehow I relate to this, but at the same time the murders literally started in episode 1!
I actually kind of wonder if they could have kept up some kind of normal-ish suburban life for a lot longer (with the occasional murder and cover up for fun) if they had stayed in marriage counseling. It got them to realize how similar their neediness is and actually communicate about their misdeeds and get through them as a horrible murder team. Instead, they just forgot about all that and started keeping secrets from and plotting against each other again right after they left counseling lol
On god!
y e s. i literally came to the realization halfway through and was like wow. what the fuck am i thinking?
I felt this
honestly, *same* *though*
SAME 🤣🤣🤣
This is how i felt too.
I for sure thought the Measles thing was going to be because of the baby’s exposure to her dead body and that we would have found some wild story about how he and love have to now be on the run because of it. This season felt so dramatic.
My favorite moment tbh 😂
That was my favourite scene as well! Was trying to describe how funny that was to my friend but she hasn't seen any of S3 yet so I didn't want to spoil it
Joe's facial expressions had me rolling during this scene...Penn can be really comedic sometimes and I. Here for it
really grew to love that couple - over the moon they found a key in the end🙏🙏🙏
It was genius how they made the best of their situation. They even got to TedEx!
Yes. Their honesty, communication and trust, is god tier.


Edit: just finished ep. 8 so I might change my opinion

Edit 2: Yep. Just as I thought sherry and cary are goals.
I was pretty impressed by their character development, at least to the audience. When you saw them through Joe or Love's perspective, you only saw shallow people who wanted to fit in. But when they were in the cage, there was no denying how solid their marriage was and how much they worked at it.
They were the most annoying people but made the healthiest couple which I find pretty interesting
I went from rooting for Joe and Love to kill them both in the first half of season to getting teary as they declared their love for each other in the cage and being so relieved they lived. Hope to find my own optimized partner! 😂
When she screamed "They're the weak spot!" I cheered. I replayed that last montage so many times. I hated them at first and thought they would drop this couples therapy banter but it turns out they are great at communication their wants and needs and are such a goal. I thought they were fake as shit but turns out they're just dedicated to being the best versions of themselves.
>level 1hodorito · 3dIn the end Sherry and Cary were the truly optimized couple

In the end the trauma was the >!Couples Therapy Book!< they made along the way
The word "optimized" had me dying!! Totally changed my perception of Sherry when he said that haha, like "hmmm she IS optimized that's a good way to put it" Thought they were fucking weird at first but after that men's trip I thought Cary was hilarious, by the end I was just really praying for them. They ended up being more loyal and caring people than we thought, thought they would've murdered each other in there! There communication is top tier, my bf better be prepared to speak in red, green, and purple flag terms soon 🤣🤣🤣🤣
yeah i went from hating them and wanting them to be murdered on the swinging night to loving them and wishing they would kill joe and love lol
I've grown to absolutely love these two
I’m so glad they got out and survived! I really liked them in the end and they were so funny while they were locked up
So true. The way they handled the cage was really interesting. They have a super solid relationship foundation
Their tedtalk is worth it
I liked the fact they didn’t make a big thing of it. No huge (metaphorical) sign saying “Look we have a blind character and it’s a plot point!”. He is blind, and that’s that.
yes! i loved this so much. and it didn’t feel forced at all. they introduced Dante as a normal character without focusing too much on his disability like other shows. amazing addition
I didn’t know he’s blind! Wow lol I need to pay better attention when I binge
Probably the biggest positive takeaway from this season in my perspective. 2nd half of the season pretty much ruined any character I care for and the plot became so mangled and messy it just wasn't a good product. Hopefully the writers can figure it out for season 4.
I loved this too! My fav moment was when Love was texting him and it was voice texts. And for a moment I was like…huh? But then it clicked! And it was just a seamless interaction like sending a written text. I really love how the team behind you seems to care and turn tropes/common “jokes” on their heads.
Same with Love's ex being deaf and it not being a plot point or defining his character
Loved the idea but would it be harsh to say that the actor didn't really was that convincing as a blind person? There was an entire scene with him seemingly looking directly into Marienne's eyes and also at other times I didn't find it convincing at all.
It didn’t feel forced at all
Wait haha he was blind??? I thought the cane was interesting - I really didn't tell outside of that.
I loved this too! I didn’t even realize it until the scene where he asks Marienne to describe Joe’s hairstyle when he comes in after that photo shoot with Love and Henry. By then I started paying more attention and saw his white cane
Dante was blind?????? Wtf
I literally had no idea he was blind until reading this!
YES THIS...loved that they included him in there
I did not even notice he was blind
I loved this too! Also, the actor who himself isn't blind, played it really subtly and respectfully and didn't overdo it like another non-blind actors have in the past.
I forgot half the time because it wasn’t a weird thing they mentioned all the time. He just was.
Just like Love’s first husband being dead in S2 wasn’t a special plot point. He just happened to be deaf.
I noticed this too lmfao, so ridiculous. Hollywood is so fucked re: how it treats actresses as they age
NOO REALLY? LMFAO HE LOOKS 18
I somehow didn’t register that Theo was supposed to be a teen and only realized it more than halfway through the series…. 🤦‍♀️
😂😂😂 I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT NOTICED 😂😂😂
poor man's robert sheehan.
Apparently they are dating in real life too
By like a year lol
They’re also rumored to be dating :)
They are also rumored to be dating now in real life! Which is all I could think about when I was watching season 3
Its like ludwig XVI and henry XL
Best behaved child on the planet didn’t cry in 4 episodes.  For all my parents out there I was like where tf is this baby?!
Oh, man. I actuslly forgot about the brother. So when Forty came up, I tjougjt I heard Fordy, reference to Henry and Ford Lol
Because we saw most of the trailer involving Natalie happen in the first episode I knew she was dying but they really gave her 40 minutes cut her a check and she’s gone with the wind
I thought it was kinda funny

Hype her so fans think she’s a big deal and then just off her

Trailers intentionally mislead people often all the time now 

One thing that is weird to me is that they cast a fairly recognizable actress just to kill her off in episode 1
Yeah, that totally threw me off. I spent the rest of the season trying to keep up. What chaos.
Same! Her and Theo were my faves
It’s sad because I found her way more intriguing than his other “love” interests
I think her role was more of like a foundation of the season, she didn’t air much but surely gave us something new. Its something new in a way Joe was obsessing with 2 girls now lol, and we see how Love’s willing to do anything to “save” their family. Season 3 is more of like Joe and Love’s mind games with each other. But Joe is just too damn good and always one step ahead haha
I'm thinking it was a last minute decision. Maybe the actress wasn't working out like they thought she would?
I recognized her as Lindsay from One Tree Hill and I’m glad to say that her face and body hasn’t changed that much since OTH.
I feel like Joe changed significantly in this season though, which could change how season 4 plays out. I mean he saved Theo when he was a clear liability even if he had in mind that Theo could help him out since Love attacked him. But it was obvious that Theo was blinded by "love" and Joe knew that but he still didn't kill him.

He didn't kill Matthew and thought he was a "good man". Both Sherry and Cary were huge liabilities especially since that plan of his to fake his death wasn't planned much in advance. He also started thinking about killing Ryan after a lot of issues piled up on Marianne and not right away like with Beck's bf.

The Joe of season 1 or 2 would have killed all of those people without a second thought. He is being more "considerate" now yet still severely psychotic, but much less than before.
Yup. Hard agree on everything. 

And they killed Love. Wtf. She made this season fun! Can't imagine S4 without her.
Agreeeeeeeeeeeed so much. 

The first arc was moving along at such a wild pace, but then when it had to develop the Marienne and Theo subplots, it hit a lull. The last three episodes picked up considerably, but by then the payoffs weren’t hitting as much, and honestly some of the things felt pretty rushed by the end.
The whole point is that Joe isn’t actually in love with anyone.  He fixates on women, gets them or murders them, gets bored, and then finds another new one who’s supposedly the “one”.  I seriously doubt they ever indulge you in a harmonious relationship in this series.  Joe is intended to form quick intense relationships and then get bored
My thoughts exactly! By the end I was hoping >!that Love would kill Joe and blame all the murders on him because I was so bored with his storyline. I think watching Love as the main character in the next season would have been more interesting, because we don't really get into her head the way we do with Joe's.!< I hope they make season 4 different in some big way.
I feel the same. I really hope that season four is the one where Joe gets his comeuppance and he’s in a mess he cannot murder his way out of. The format of “Joe stalks a woman using the same creepy tactics and then goes on a killing spree” is getting old. I also hope they leave out the cage next season, because at this point it’s kind of silly. 

I think that if they try to continue on with it being the same thing in a new country, I kind of hope that the storyline is set up in such a way that he goes in with a disadvantage- a woman who is already aware of what a creep he is so he can’t actually do the thing where he molds himself into her perfect man, a foreign country, not having access to his cage, and ultimately he gets caught because he’s not actually the criminal mastermind he thinks he is.
My thoughts exactly. I could have done without the librarian drama completely. Love and Joe as a couple were so entertaining. I read the third book and it is NOTHING like the third season. The show was way better in my opinion but I just didn’t like that ending at all.
I want season 4 or 5 to be about Joe getting caught or at least running away from the cops. What happened to the detective from season 1 that was still after him? I think he was in season 2 I could be wrong because I haven’t watched it in a while.
Marienne felt like a plot device to me more than the actual "You" of this season if that makes sense... im surprised he kept going after her at the end i wouldn't be shocked if he moves on to someone else instead after searching for like a year or something.
Fucking exactly. Love dying is the worst thing they could have done. Get rid of Henry, fine, but love fucking sells every bit of their relationship
I agree. I was more excited to see how they worked as a married couple but they gave up on that super fast and both of them found their own muses to cheat with. I guess that tracks, given their personalities. But like you said it felt really stale and repetitive. I like the show, but I don’t wanna watch the same exact plot for every season.
I don’t understand how this show will still be even a little bit interesting for a fourth season if they’re going to do the same exact thing over and over. I watched the rest after the first three episodes yesterday hoping for it to turn around but it was just tired tropes and predictability.
I agree. What a rollercoaster with Sherry and Cary, but now they are my favorites! For me, Joe’s new love or let’s say obsessive interests keep weakening. We had season one where he had long term Candice and then the entire season was dedicated to Beck. Season two was his fresh start in LA only to find out that Candice was NOT dead and his new obsession kills too. Now we have the two killers living in a neighborhood and it got messy - just not enough depth as the priors for Joe and I feel that Loves character if anything grew far more. I would have liked to see her survive in the end - and for the next season to be revolving around her in a new country. Like what else can they do with Joe? Lol 

I still loved the series - how can you not - but with season 4 confirmed - I’m tired of joe oops
I loved Marienne, but I kind of agree with them not really having much chemistry....however, imo, they dont really need to. I just see Joe as someone who is impulsive about falling for people, and she fit the profile.
I agree there was zero connection between Joe and librarian for me, and love and Theo just seemed really weird and unnecessary to the plot
Just finished last night. I was scrolling to find this exact take. I liked season 3 don’t get me wrong, but I just fear the show is getting slightly repetitive. Obviously joe is a killer and a stalker so he’s going to do just that, but like you said Idt he had great chemistry w Marienne. I actually liked Theo and Love together since you knew there were never going to end up with each other.

And I agree with your sentiment about season 4. I hope it’s not just Joe stalking random French women until he finds marienne or a new love interest.
I felt this exactly! I liked it at first when Joe acknowledged for the first time ever that it was a pattern and he's repeating it, but then got bored when he went through with it. I felt so grossed out and worried for Marianne, though.
Yeah I remember saying to myself at some point that “I’m bored with Joe’s storyline, I wanna get back to Love and see what she’s doing”. I think it was during the part where he was following Ryan before he killed him
I agree. I absolutely hated Theo and Marianne's characters and I wanted Joe and Love to stick together and end all threats to their marriage. Those 2 both being crazy together was the show for me. I really wish it didn't go this way. 

I figured they were going that way but they wrote it completely opposite and now Love's gone and it's just Joe simping for boring, busted girls.
The first couple of episodes were the highlight for me as well. Started feeling disappointed after that and was not fond of the finale.
I feel the exact same. It was emotionally draining to be invested in the characters only to have them revert all their growth and be back at the beginning as if nothing was really accomplished. And then in addition they are so sloppy that half a town has to be killed. I don’t know if I will tune in for season 4
Marianne the Librarianne and Joe really didn’t have the chemistry. It was disappointing how stale that storyline felt-just really flat and like it didn’t matter.I hope she’s not in season 4.
Couldn’t have said it better myself. I 100% agree. I wanted to see more of love and joe on the same team I was not interested in seeing a repeat of season one and two. Not to mention that Marianne was horribly boring and like you said, no chemistry
I thought Love & Theo had amazing chemistry, I didn't really feel the chemistry as much with Joe and Librarian though.
> But then we went to the monotonous route of Joe with some new girl that after the past two seasons felt really stale.

I feel like you have to go into this show with the understanding that Joe is obsessive and he can't control it and it's just how his mind works. You have to accept that part of his personality and his character makes a lot of sense.
I 100% agree. I don't know if I'll even be able to get into the 4th season. With each episode being 40mins, we've watched practically like 6 or 7 movies of this already. At this point I wanted a resolution. Maybe not a happy ending but they built up Joe and Love so much. They had been through everything, and I really feel like it should've ended with them putting down the knife and raising their kid 🤦🏼‍♂️ kinda disappointed and feel a kind of heart brokenness
I thought Theo and Love had a good connection, Joe and librarian lady not so much
Theo definitely killed the show and the librarian girl as well. As if the story just needed some spice and lets put a horny teenager in who forces himself on a married woman kinda. I dont know it felled very scripted and just didnt fit right. Season 1 and 2 were great. I wont be watching 4 and I quit during ep 6 on s3
Yesss I was so annoyed when they both went off and got distracted. I also found from one episode to read next it made no sense. They did so much work in therapy and he said she wa his soul mate....it was such good character development and then...Marianne 🙄
Felt nothing with Love and Theo but thought Joe and Marienne had a lot of chemistry. I think season 4 will be Joe finding Marienne in Paris. I don't think that's the end of her.
Disagree greatly, because Joe’s pattern wasn’t the focused it was even emphasised how ironic and meek he was falling into it again by him himself, but he still did and then we were dragged along through Love’s antics. This felt more like her season, which all the more justified the lack of chemistry with both their interests as anymore interest would have clouded the instability she was meant to show us within herself and her relationship with Joe

However I too have no idea where they could possibly take season 4 if not a man hunt for Joe or someone black mailing him which would also be stale and repeated
Nailed it
This 100%.
Shit take. The show focuses heavily on their cheating and we see why they have chemistry. Watch the show next time.
Yesss I was so annoyed when they both went off and got distracted. I also found from one episode to read next it made no sense. They did so much work in therapy and he said she wa his soul mate....it was such good character development and then...Marianne 🙄
I wish they would have had a Bonnie and Clyde thing. It would have been so much more interesting if they stayed in love
Marriage therapist reevaluates her career after news of the murder suicide.
Thank you so much! It was really bugging me where I've seen her before and I was too lazy to imdb lol.
YOU EMBARRASSED ME INFRONT OF... the marriage therapist
The lovely and talented Ayelet Zurer
HAHAHA I KNOW
And superman's kryptonian mom
i thought they were gonna write the marriage therapist as theos birth mom 😂 would’ve been a nice twist
How did we not get a final scene of her watching the news or reading the newspaper just flabbergasted, would have been incredible
I was wondering where i knew her from. Kingpins old lady
Morena Baccarin played Vanessa. Their therapist was a different actress.
Joe and Fisk would’ve been good friends I feel
That’s who that was! I knew I recognized her from somewhere
My favorite episode was the therapist one!
Maybe one for UK viewers but she was giving me Karen Brady vibes.
I thought she looked familiar! I didn’t want to look up any names and accidentally see spoilers before I finished the season.
When you were a boy….
yea… that’s what made her questionable… not the m*rders
tbh he deserved to get hurt

Season 2 is the winner for me too after finishing season 3. Best ending twist and I enjoyed the LA life.
Different tastes. I absolutely loved seeing Joe be completely cognizant of what was wrong with him and yet find himself completely unable to control his obsessive pattern on Marienne. Plus what a wild spiral, all really coming from that first little lie he told Love that set her against Natalie.
S1 was the best for me by far. The first episode of S1 in particular is amazing TV. 

It’s so well crafted in luring us into believing the facade of who Joe wants us to think he is, and then you have the grand reveal at the end of the episode showing how Joe orchestrated all of those “chance encounters” with Beck and was a stalker the whole time.
i agree 100%. i thought it was fantastic. Especially after knowing joe for 3 seasons, it makes the things he says even more comedic.
usually for shows like this where the plot is redone each season it gets worse by season 

so I watched season 1 thought hmm not bad. Not my favourite show ever but watchable. Then I watched season 2 and was like holy shit this is the best fucking show Ive seen in years. Squid game was nowhere near that good. Then season 3 was watchable again but kind of a letdown. Joe had 0 chemistry with the new librarian and dont get me started on that theo shit. Love is into crazy people with problems to fix and then suddenly the teenager is squished into that role? Bullshit it felt so forced.

&#x200B;

Overall I would give season 1 8/9 out of 10

season 2 11/10 

season 3 6/7 out of 10. I didnt like this season but the first episode was funny and the ending was sad.
I agree. I really loved Forty. And Delilah. Missed forty this season. And ellie. Really I missed all of them lol
hm i personally loved 1 and 3 and hated 2. best finale though and obviously necessary to watch to proceed with the series.
Season 2 is my favourite of the 3 too!

It leaned more into the dark comedy aspect than season 1 did, and I totally agree that there were so many interesting characters in it.
season 2 is my favorite season of all time, of any show. so i was disappointed with this season but still very good. i think this one's a little better than season 1 and quite worse than season 2.
Definitely agree
I loved the black humour and over the top situations. I wouldn't say it is a "good" series but it works in its own right.
I loved season 2 too actually! I just finished season 3 and literally gave the exact reasons as you as for why I liked season 2. Characters and it was just fcking hilarious
She was nuts but oh so entertaining. Great performance by Victoria Pedretti.
Am I the only one that won't watch season 4 because Love was the saving stone of this show? Now it's back to Joe being a dumbass fucking creep without a care in the world fucking awesome, exactly what I wanted
I did too! I feel like she kept this season alive and entertaining.
She was the most refreshing part of the season.
I was strangely rooting for her the whole season. Maybe because joe was such a dickhead with his relentless crushes and neglect towards their marriage.
Oh no I loved her too-by far the best character in the show!!!
Just finished S3 and I can confirm I am crushing hard on Victoria Pedretti. My goodness, she is excellent in this show.
I think i scared my girlfriend when i told her i felt really bad for Love and was so sad they couldnt work it out lol they were perfect for each other!
The acting during sex scenes were... Really ncie...
Based on all the threads talking about how much people move the character I’d say no
I loved her so much more this season than last season.  Victoria slayed this performance.
[deleted]
Stresses you out a bit though because some scenes you're like "what are you doing?! You have other more important things you need to be taking care of!"
That’s good to hear it gets better!
I'm glad "Dexter" got mentioned in S02, because in a lot of ways this show is kind of made out of the best parts of that series -- the funny, sometimes serious narration, the sense that things are always on the verge of falling apart for the protagonists, the basic premise of, "Why would a serial killer think they're actually a good person?". 

"Dexter" dropped the ball so many times, as evidenced by how fans hated it near the end. "You" is in a position to avoid that by leaning more into the absurdity of its premise, the ridiculous schemes of its protagonist, and I think above all maintaining a consistent tone and focus. "Dexter" was so damn *unfocussed* near the end. There were all these peripheral characters with way too much screen time. Also all that behind the scenes drama. Hoo boy! Hopefully those guys can pull it together for that new season coming up.

Anyway, yeah, "You" has turned into my favourite silly, pulpy, lurid and sometimes actually insightful show. If they come back for S04, I'm hoping they can keep hitting that sweet spot.
the last episode was SO good!!
Get ready to be literally disappointed beyond belief. Fuck that ending
Sooo good right!?
Because he stops caring about literally everyone else once he has an obsession.
I think he uses the "protector" excuse or whatever to justify his fixation on things
I hated that he got fixated on Marienne, I didn’t like her character, first off she knew he was married yet she was crushing on him hard and finding ways to flirt and talk with him at the library. She in my opinion is terrible and knowing he is still married had sex with joe. In the end of the day, she was ruining Joe’s relationship with Love by not putting her foot down in all of this and stop entertaining joe
I absolutely didn’t like when they started introducing this “new obsession” with Marianne. At some point, I felt genuinely bad for Love really.
Because he’s Joe
I thought his agenda was bring Henry with him and have Marienne raise him and her daughter together.

Love was becoming too unpredictable so he wanted a wife swap.
Marienne was better for Henry than his own mother was and Joe ideated having a blended family with her and Juliette. Maybe that was his justification that he still cared about Henry’s best interest.
The writers are dumbasses
“You are the obsession”
Dbd ~
He still cared, he says to himself Marianne is the best mother and along with Henry they would make a perfect family
That character is comedy gold. The whole exchange with Cary's over-abbreviating and the other dude chiming in to address it and translate had me rolling.
The squirrel didn't think so.
Honestly thought he was such a dumb and annoying guy at first but he turned out to be my favourite, what a fuckin bro
My bisexual himbo king
“You are one fine specimen of a man”. I loved that scene
Certainly the most optimized one!
Am I only only one who still can't stand him sherry?
It was mentioned at one point when he was selling books but not much after
Ellie needs to come back in season 4, my favourite character from the series hopefully shes randomly in Paris and she connects with Joe again
I was so happy when I found out season 2 was going to be in LA because omg yay maybe he’ll see paco. Didn’t fucking happen. We mentioned Ellie for like 2 episodes 5 seconds, then just forgot she existed.
I suspect both Ellie and Paco could be back for s4. Team up with Marienne and take him down once and for all
They said he sends her money when she reaches out to him.  guess she was doing well over this time.
yeah he was sending her money in the beginning of the season then just forgot about her like every other character on the show that exists solely as a plot point for joe.
Definitely seems like a plothole to me. 

I think it's possible that he was stealing originals, refurbishing them, selling them, and replacing them with knock-offs so that Marianne wouldn't get suspicious, but it needed to be addressed. It was also a dumbass move to apply for a job from the place where you were stealing from.
He mentioned that he was restoring and selling antique books to send money to Ellie. I think the assumption was he continued to do that? Could even do so from Paris.
They stop caring about any plot point that was more than 3 episodes ago
Because he didn't wanna fuck him up, like he's been fucked up I guess? And also a daughter would be another woman/girl to protect
I think he expected his daughter to become his new obsession, since he had fallen out of love with Love at that point.
He sees himself in the boy, projects all his own issues on him.
Didn't he say it was emblematic of getting things wrong or something?
A lot of dysfunctional men have this thought/impulse. I'm not saying its right or logical, and i don't have kids but tbh I share it. I always thought I would be a good dad to a daughter  but i think if I had a son I would fuck him up or he would grow up to hate me, probably bc of my relationship with my own dad.
Joe doesn't like men. It's mentioned in one of his flash backs. Also if you think about it, the men in Joe's lives aren't very nice.
I think the reason for this is because he knew Love and Dottie would attach their grief about Forty to the baby. He mentions Love still hasn’t processed Forty’s passing. This is shown to be true with how much Love and Dottie go on to call Henry, Forty
on top of what others have said, he didnt have any positive male influences in his life.  he didnt really even have male friends, except that one kid i guess.
right? like a girl can’t be a murderer? um hello look at your wife joe
Me too! I was also like.. “you ain’t lyin’ Joe!” While simultaneously thinking “Joe you’re a bad person; you’ve killed so many people.
> hiding their own cage keys separately 
 
Is this implying they agreed on hiding the keys there? Because when watching it I thought neither of them knew the other one is hiding the key. They just both thought they'd be smart and hide one key there just in case.
Woman *merely exists*

Joe "Were you born, for me?"
Is this a flirt?
Lmao seriously.  So accurate 😂
...except they actually were flirting with him every time.
I mean, that's how I was taught to flirt
Ugh, everyone ends up in that dumb cage. You *know* he's shipped that thing to Paris.
Lol at this point the cage IS a character
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cageeee
how tf do they even get tht cage in there without ever being seen or questioned!
I like the cage because it gives them time but i do wonder if theyre going to do something different in season 4
The whole time I was watching and thinking the same thing! How are the police not catching them?
Right? Wondering if this will come back to bite Joe in the ass in future seasons. On the other hand, if that occurred, it seems unrealistic for investigators to only look into the fingerprints and determine it was Joe long after the killings occurred. Hmm.
To me, all crime shows have the “fingerprints aren’t real” suspension of disbelief.
YES I was thinking this when he drove natalies car
Joe seems unhinged enough to have burned his fingerprints off
I mean they showed love planting prints on the axe when they framed the antivax guy. They figured it in, just wanted to keep the wardrobes simple I guess
I thought it was interesting how Natalie checked out ‘Gone Girl’ from the library in the beginning of season 3
I think that’s sort of the point, considering it was a fake suicide note written by Joe.
I feel like anyone that knew her would be able to read that note and realize that she didn’t write it
I did feel that.

Given Joe was writing it, I think he was trying to give a very warped perception of Love. Unlike the other times he's written for his victims, this actually ends with his voice on top of hers.

Maybe because nobody really knew Love in Madre Linda, so he could get away with it. Versus Beck, Peach, Gil, who prior to their deaths were known to their community.
I would agree but it’s not Love speaking. It’s her voice but Joe’s words. The way Victoria delivered that monologue was as close as she can get to sounding like how Joe does his monologues.
Like a cross between Gone Girl and Promising Young Woman
The whole thing was a gone girl ripoff
I thought the exact same thing
I definitely thought that trip was headed to gay sex the whole time.
would have loved to see them all bang it out then cry afterwards
More entertaining than any camping trip I’ve been on
they seemed like such a genuine sweet couple in season 2 :(
I felt like the writers wanted to find a way to turn the audience on Love, and this was what they came up with. Just overall horrible writing and they frankly ruined her character just to further the plot. She was a completely different person in season 3, which is fine, to an extent. The core Love shouldn't change which it did.
James Scully (the actor) is such eye candy in this as well. I know its meant to be meaningful but i can't still get over *quite* how beautiful he is
I felt extremely uncomfortable when love hugged him though….
Yes! He was my favourite part of season 2! And that scene was so great. My husband was all pearl clutching at the idea of her in the tub with her brother, but knowing Forty and Love... That's just par for the course. Real or not.😹
i loved that scene so much
i felt like it was breathe of fresh air and got me reinvested in that episode
I'm still impressed with how much I disliked him in the very beginning and how quickly and hard I ended up falling for him haha
Totally agree with you. Love and Joe knew each one's secrets. They were perfect for each other. Now I'm very very sad :(
Came here to say this. Love added another dimension to the show with the co-villain thing. Without her it’s just gonna be a repeat of the first two seasons. I’m kind of tired of the same story over and over again 🥱
I am right there with you.
I literally had zero interest in Marienne whatsoever.
I loved Love. I can nolonger pretend that my reason for liking her character is for that reason alone. Joe didn't know how good it had it....
Hopefully love returns in season 4,she made it out of the fire before it burnt or something like that,and comes back for revenge.
This is kind of where I'm at as well.

I completely understand those who were near-relieved when Love died and/or didn't like the character, and overall felt this season was the best offering of the show to date. Thing is, while the story's 'driver seat' belongs to Joe, it was fascinating having someone ride in the passenger seat...or in some instances, take over for the driver.

Love added a sense of unpredictability the show desperately needed by the end of the second season. Thanks to the brilliant twist towards the end of that season, it immediately made the whole season itself re-watchable, and in addition made the past year and a half waiting for Season 3 so much more enjoyable due to the chaotic expectations of what Season 3 could/would offer. Needless to say, Season 3 delivered on that 'chaotic nature'...for the first 4 episodes.

Those first 4 episodes were wildly insane, with moment after moment stacking on digging the couple deeper into the hole. It's not to say that the show wouldn't immediately do a 'Bonnie & Clyde' spin, it would naturally have to work towards something like that, but what we got initially was tremendous for what it was. Then the season keeps evolving, and by the end I was left utterly sour. Wasn't crazy about Theo or Marienne. They both initially felt like detours to pad out the season, yet when they both in some sense became a choosing point of both the main characters, it was clear that their roles had a bigger purpose. This makes things even more frustrating, as Love chose her family and Joe chose...not his family. Both of these ultimately do fit within their characters for sure, but as Season 2 evolved the characters, I was hoping Season 3 would do the same. \[On a side note: the subtlety of Marienne being the loose adaptation of Mary Kaye from "YOU LOVE ME" was pretty cool. She was a mother, had a daughter, and had a 'famous' husband that had issues of his own.\]

If you think about it, Love killed only one person this season out of impulsiveness + passion. Joe killed one person this season as well out of impulsiveness + passion (until the end).

Love's death was aggravating because it's showing the show is refusing to evolve. It was a third of what made the overall conclusion feel more like a 'bitter end'. The second third was Joe giving his son to Dante. With Henry being with Dante, it does complete his (Dante's) character arc for the season. Finally, Joe being relocated to a new location essentially gives him a 'clean slate', and has the show defaulting to (possibly) how it began in Season 1. Credit where credit is due: the writing/staging/filming/editing/music/acting/etc, (essentially everything) was all on point this season. Personally, I don't discredit the talent behind the show for what happened, I just didn't like the result. Is what it is.

YOU started as a fun creepy thriller/etc, but Season 2 made the show so much more profound. I saw the show as more abstract storytelling about the dangers of social media, a commentary on regional culture, and different aspects about 'love'. Love's character name alone kind of filled a lingering desire Joe/the show was wanting since Season/book 1 - to find "love". He ultimately did, and from there a second protagonist is added to the show. It would've been cool in Season 3 if there was another character introduced that could've showcased another aspect for the show to delve into. At the same time, Joe's character killing 'Love' also feels like another stride the show wants to take to further flesh out his (Joe's) character.

It's hard to be oblivious to why certain things had to happen in Season 3, but I guess overall I just wasn't a fan. At its essence: I liked the unpredictable chaotic dynamic between Joe + Love, I liked how the show kept evolving the story with them, and I liked having the idea that there were still limitless possibilities to the kinds of stories they could tell with them both. With that said, I won't be watching Season 4 of YOU, but I really hope those who do continue with the show enjoy it tenfold. The only way I could see myself returning to the series is if Season 4 is the last, or the ongoing theory that Love actually survived (which is highly doubtful).

However, I'll still be reading the books. On a side note: How's Ethan doing? Are Love's friends doing well? How about Paco + Claudia? With Joe leaving the country, he can't really help out Ellie anymore, right? Is anything happening with Dr. Nicky? How does Anavrin suddenly go broke and/or why has Love's dad essentially ex-communicated her off screen? If Love knew about the dangers of wolfsbane + knew Joe was always one-step ahead, wouldn't she want to have a failsafe? What happened to Delilah + Candace's bodies? Are Lynn and Annika alright? I'm sure a lot of these questions weren't really meant to be answered, but now thanks to the clunker of an ending for Season 3...I'm left with those questions. It was a really fun ride, YOU. Cheers to the crazy times.
Even though he’s always whining about wanting to be accepted and loved, Love accepting Joe being a murderer turned him off. I think it reminded him of how his mom stayed with his dad after he showed his less than sparkly true colors. He has a theme of seeing women stay with the monster. And I think he resents her for it.
just like the rest of these comments. you are 100% right. love and joe were both emotionally broken and flawed, they were perfect for each other. their dynamic was what made this season for me. also the acting from both are incredible  


i feel you for the next season. im not that excited now. but hey, i trust the writers and the growth they have done so idk we'll see
This might be a controversial opinion here but I absolutely think they killed the wrong person at the end. I would love Love to have survived and for Joe to have died. And then season 4 could switch to her internal monologue... 

I just think she's such an interesting character, I'm sad we won't see more of her. And it feels like S4 is going to be more of the same, just in France. If they weren't going to kill off Joe I'd prefer the series to end here. I can see it all going downhill next season writing wise.
I agree. I was very upset when Love was killed. I kept hoping he would save her and change his mind. Even when the house was on fire I expected her to maybe make an appearance in Paris stalking Joe, she was my favorite character in the show and probably one of my favorites in general. So flawed, so conflicted, her emotion was so raw and Pedretti did an amazing job playing our her ups and downs. There were so many scenes with her that made you forget you were watching a show. 

Sad to see her go. Idk if I’m looking forward to season 4 without her, but I don’t think Joe will ever find “the one” he always thinks the grass is greener on the other side, is never happy with what he has, and will always let his insecurities get the better of him. 

That being said, this was definitely my favorite season by far.

Edit: grammar
\#teamlove
I would've loved for them to become partners, teammates right? Being honest with each other and accepting their flaws. Open relationship or at least coparenting. I think the message is that they didn't trust each other enough.
I wish that somehow Love surprisingly either survived the drugs/fire or didn't die but was arrested and we watch her get out for season 4.... :/
I agree, but also when you put these two people together, I think the only logical conclusion is that one of them will kill the other. Love was one of my favorite characters though, hopefully season 4 won't go back to the same old Joe.
I really liked the dynamic of >!two serial killers living together, so it's a shame that they killed her off.!<
Honestly I thought they were going to get divorced and co-parent after Marienne gave Love the pep talk
I liked the ending but I do think it was a mistake killing off Love.
It’s funny - before the Sherry and Cary thing my husband and I kept being like “they should just be poly!!!” And then they finally got the chance and we were excited for it to save their marriage but we al know how that turned out
Same. I first watched S1 in 2019, but stopped watching half way because it got really boring due to Beck and friends. I gave S2 a try in 2020 without completing S1 and Love's character made me enjoy the show so much more that I ended up watching S1 again just to get the full picture of Joe's story.
Victoria KILLED it this season. Her acting was so good. Normally Penn blows me away but he was kinda “meh” for me this season 😢
Season 4 needs to be the last one, and the only thing that would make sense are the walls closing in on Joe. He is too high profile now and has left too many breadcrumbs for someone to not figure out what is going on. If next season is just him stalking a woman again in a new location its gonna be a hard pass.
Nah she was getting annoying as fk and the show is about joe goldberg
now this!!! Right here is the best comment. 100% agree.
I agree. It was too expected for it to end like that. I really enjoyed their chemistry as delusional murderers trying to be good parents and spouses. 😹😹
Fucking literally can't get over her fucking death right now. Joe isn't even charismatic anymore, just a lonely freak preying on women. Love at least made that shit interesting. Fuck I can't wait to not watch season 4
I think part of the problem is that the stakes were really high this season because there’s a baby and because Joe and Love have this relationship where sometimes they are one another’s best asset and other times they are each other’s biggest liability. They have to kind of navigate around each other a lot, and there’s a major theme of mutually assured destruction and the fact that they both know what the other one is capable of. 

But the thing is, the stakes dropped completely for season four. No real ties to anyone left, just single Joe with no one else to take care of, and able to just start over from scratch. And if he’s on a different continent altogether, he’s basically walked away from any of the complications that followed him around before.
I was REALLY hoping this would be the last season and it would end with Love slicing the shit out of Joe and becoming a single mom. 

Girl boss
 /s
I hate this new chick and I know that if she turns out to be the love interest next season I won’t be  watching she is a terrible character and she’s so bland nothing about her is remotely entertaining
Honestly I’m just kinda meh, I love the actress and I think she’s part of the reason why people are so disappointed but I can do without the character 

I really did grow to like their relationship and the dynamic that was added when they became a team but let’s be honest they were never going to live a happily ever after life
I would be more interested in a season 4 if Joe died and love continued I think
Argh yes I feel this way too! I loved the dynamic with Love. Feels a bit flat now.
>!It might turn out he didn't dose her right and she comes back to f\*\*k with him. Wouldn't surprise me.!<
How do you binge that much in one day? I salute you lol.
I mean we didn’t see her die so there’s hope but seems like they kill off every women Joe’s in love with. Hopefully they mix it up in season 4.
This! The interaction between love and Joe had so much potential.. sad to see her go
Agree with this. Joe got outstaged by Love this season that I wish it was her show instead.
Totally agree with this! I loved them together
Marianne.
omg yes!! I wish they ( him, her and baby) fled to another country together....
It’s probably bad that I wish Love would have killed Joe and season 4 would be her being a single mom, trying to find new love, killing people, and trying to cover it up without Joe or her parents to help her.
Your thoughts?
“and I seriously have no idea where they will take the show in the next season.”

Spoilers for season 4: >!Joe becomes obsessed with another woman and then kills a bunch of people.!<
I didn’t understand how Matthew didn’t see Sherry and Cary moved from the house to the bakery or Gil’s body being moved around on any camera or them coming and going in the middle of the night when they were covering up Natalie’s death. Surely Matthew looked at Gil’s cameras, also cameras are *everywhere*, just because your camera didn’t catch something doesn’t mean a neighbour’s didn’t. 

My biggest problem is Joe is a smart guy, capable of introspection, but his naivety about living happily ever after is confounding. The ‘if we were together we’d live happily ever after!’ dialogue is tiring and inconsistent with the rest of his character. His optimism and delusion is on par with a 13 year old girl when he *knows* he has a pattern of losing interest and women never fulfilling his idealistic fantasies. Realistically he should be wearying of relationships, cynical about love or at least have identified his patterns. He is a smart guy and it makes no sense.
matthew was a little deranged after losing his wife, he wasn't methodical in the stalking, he put on every single camera and couldn't weed much out
I wanted to watch >!Love to get away with it after she warned Marianne.!<

>!Love kills Joe and frames him completely. S4 she starts anew in Chicago or Miami or sth and the pattern resets. She latches on to a new guy, he doesn’t give her enough attention. Commence murder spree and life ruining of said new guy. More believable because it’s a new killer and we know the FBI would be all over Joe’s ass by now!!<

>!Then maybe it turns Joe faked his own death and seeks out revenge because Penn Badgley is fantastic and we would miss him v much!!<
Instead of moving on with the story you see from S2(later half of the season) that the writers had a whole different agenda and we see this loop of obsession and stalking even in the trailer for S3.  


Somewhere along the line I feel the direction of the story took a major turn just to milk drama for the sake of drama instead of character growth or story progression. I don't think  I'll even bother with this series anymore.
All season I was panicking >!they'd off Love because the focus is ultimately on Joe!<. She was hands down the best part of this season. She drove the entire story and brought yet more freshness to the show again this season. The weakest part of this season was  >!Joe's fixation on Marienne!< and it was tiring to get through those scenes. I hope they find something interesting for season 4 because I just can't sit through another season like 1 & most of 2. It was good once, but you can't strike gold with that formula again imo.

When the last episode hit and >!he pulled the twist off I was so sad. I wanted them on the run with Henry not trusting one another and being a toxic murder couple!<
I'm not sure why people think Joe was supposed to change. The point is, he'll never change. No matter how much they play house - Joe will always find a way out. He simply cannot stop himself. I came into this season knowing those two were ticking time bombs. 

Joe has been hesitant about Love since she killed Ellies sister and admitted even in the beginning of the season that he didn't want to be with her. It was to protect his child. Then he realized that he spent most of his time resenting her, cleaning up after her mistakes, when all he wanted to do was move on and find someone else to fantasize about. He will never fit in anywhere.
you said everything i was thinking. honestly i would love to see the next season be the last and have joe get caught vs. the same old “stalks and falls for a random girl who he projects all his shit onto without actually knowing her at all.”

love said it best last season: “while i was seeing you, REALLY seeing you, you were too busy gazing at a goddamn fantasy of a perfectly imperfect girl.” i’m gonna miss her, she was way smarter than everyone gave her credit for.
Agreed! The whole point of Joe is we're supposed to weirdly be on his side. This season ruined that because of the way he treated Love. And the incessant stalking for stalking's sake is getting borrrring. They need to think up something new for his character dev in season 4 because this shit is getting old.
Yes I’d be ok with Season 4 being there Final Season if all they’re gonna do is recycle the same story from Season 1 lol I think 5 Seasons Max is all I could really handle at this point. I’m gonna miss Love a lot and it’s gonna be hard without her around. So crazy to me he could just kill her so easily and not even seem to care. Before I would’ve been ok with him living a happy life in the end but now I just hope he gets caught in the end lol
>He didn’t check the camera across from the bakery once in his obsession with finding his wife’s killer, but of course, his son immediately thinks of that.

I think this one is actually explained well but just s couple of scenes. First, Matthew says he needs a facial recognition algorithm because there is too much footage to sort through, so the videos he's looking at are just ones that got facial recognition hits for the people is was searching for. Since Joe's face was obscured from the trunk, the video didn't come up with a match and Matthew, obviously not in his right mind, was only focusing on videos with matches. Theo only thought to check the footage after he saw the camera in person and realized what it was pointing at.
I was genuinely waiting for the baby cam locked on the cage to come onto Matthew's feed! I get that there was alot of footage to sort, but once he honed in on Love, how did the baby monitor in the basement not come up??
>The incessant need to make Joe stalk one person after the next makes his actions feel so poorly thought out and stupid, and I seriously have no idea where they will take the show in the next season

i dont really get this. Guy obsessively falls in love at first sight with women and idealises taking care of them. Why would he suddenly stop now
I totally agree… I can’t watch another season of Joe being world’s worst/creepiest spy with ZERO justice. Personally I didn’t even like the way they kind of let Love off the hook. By the way, what did everyone in that town have against calling the police when they had the opportunity??
>makes his actions feel so poorly thought out and stupid

I mean did he not begin the first episode of the series by jacking off outside a women's apartment? He has never really made good decisions lol
""His likability is at an all time low and is honestly irredeemable after this season""


uhm... because he was likeable and redeemable prior to this season???! The stalker/serial killer??

Well this is pretty much the point of this show, showing how Joe is an obsessed man by stalking women he likes and try to do whatever possible to affect their lives in a way that will lead them to him. So i am not sure how they could end up doing something different. To be honest i liked the concept of the series, that is why i watched it and i never felt bored. First season was Joe's introduction, second was Love's introduction with the plot twist of her being basically a female him. And third season was them trying to live together while keeping in "control" their impulsive nature. Honestly i really liked the interactions between them and how tense it felt when they were up against each other, how you literally didn't know when Love would grab a weapon and kill whoever she is talking to. Victoria's acting was completely on point. But for me this is how the show should end, it is a fine ending. Joe's life got wrapped to an extent, he is considered dead so he can start completely fresh. But a new season where he goes to do the exact same as season 1 won't be as interesting enough i think to keep viewers satisfied, no matter how successfull season 3 ends up being. Unless they come up with something different and manage to bring an extremely intriguing new concept to life
I completely agree with everything you said. Like you said, as a whole I think this season was pretty solid but a few things really annoyed me.

I know it’s a show about stalking and murdering but this season it just felt excessive. Just about every episode someone was being murdered. Love was mostly pissing me off with how impulsive she was though. Her killing Natalie and that man who was anti vax was so unnecessary. 

Secondly the way that Sherry and Cary handled the situation when they found out that Jo and Love killed Natalie was just stupid. Watching grown people not have enough common sense to make it safely out the house and then go to the police with the information was so frustrating. It just makes no sense and it’s unrealistic. 

I want next season to be about Jo being found and arrested for at least one of his crimes. I think a season focused on a court case against Jo could be really interesting. I enjoy this show but I really don’t want another season of stalking and murdering.
I would argue Joe's likeability is at an all time high simply because next to Love his actions seem measured and rational. I went into the season hoping he would lose to Love and came out glad he didn't. That's impressive that the show redeemed him enough to change my mind. Joe showed he was capable of loving someone besides himself, however briefly. Meanwhile, Love was a loose cannon, constantly jeopardizing everyones' safety and had to go.

But... Then again we have a very unreliable narrator. I think it's interesting that the show stresses how difficult Joe finds it to bond with Henry while repeatedly telling us just how far he would go to protect Henry. Meanwhile, I'm pretty sure we never hear Love say a word about whether she even likes the kiddo. Could it be that Joe/the writers don't want us to think of Love as a caring mother so that we can more easily digest her fate? If they were smart, the series creators would be collecting a series of Joes lies and omissions for a big twist at the very end of the series.
i feel like season 4 needs a time skip and have henry grown up and his POV. they can center the whole season around henry and his quest to find his “real parents”
I really wanted Love to kill Joe and for the show to continue with her next fixation.
You've got a major spoiler in your reply you should mark.
Uhmmm SPOILER ALERT. Not surprised tho
I never liked Joe, hated him since season 1. I don't know if the aim was with him to be relateable but for me he just induced disgust with everything he has done. Which is amazing because I'm indifferent to any series or movie character most of the time. I couldn't relate to him at any point. This season was good but season 1 was the best. 

Beck was the only one relatable to me because she was just a girl next door. Love was just a spoiled rich kid gone psychotic neglected by her parents. I don't care much for spoiled rich people problems in the show either. They were just annoying.
I binged it in 2 days, cant fault it i have to say and ending was perfect
Your opinion is just as good as a poopy flavored lollipop
You're absolutely right. Joe will never find his version of the one and live happily ever after. He needs the constant thrill, control, drama and murder. He needs to be invested in the chase and that's as far as it goes. He will always be in this endless predatorial cycle of catch and kill. It's getting redundant. I didn't care for Love in the new season, she was impulsive, impractical and insane. They painted her much differently than she originally was portrayed. If they would have kept the steady flow of Love being genuine and killing only for absolute survival I think they could have gone way further with the show. Instead they destroyed our outlook on her character and by the time she died I was sick of her. The ending would be fine if they weren't planning on a season 4... but what the hell are they gonna do now? I can't manage seeing Joe go on these obsessed lovesick murder sprees any more. They need to change the dynamic entirely or put a stop to it. I agree with everything you said. He finally found the one, at least the one for him, they destroyed our outlook on her and made him out to be this ungrateful maniac who never will find what he's actually looking for. I think they ruined any chance of a good season 4.
Thank you! So many funny comments here saying they wished Joe and Love would run away together and stay in love. That man is a sociopath. He doesn't love anyone. Not even his baby Henry. He needs psychiatric help and will never change on his own.
Yeah, Joe doesn't love women, he loves idealizations. He could never really love anyone he's with, because there will always be something wrong when he really learns they're not everything he imagines. And more importantly, *he can't stop himself*; he is that mentally ill.

Anyway, I burst out laughing in the last episode when he called Love "impulsive", thinking he'd really just gone and carelessly made absolutely sure that only one of them ever left that house.
The only reason he didn’t kill her in S3 was because of the baby, it was only a matter of time before he killed her. 

Still, wish he didn’t, I always had hope they would become a power couple that murders, and was looking forward to that in S4. Guess we’re starting over from scratch
As far as I'm concerned she was more of a psychopath.. Joe is not a hero by any means but Love was just batshit crazy. I wouldn't go as far as to say he doesn't love them at all but more that he loves who he believes them to be. He would have been content to marry love and live happily with her until he found out she was a woman with no restraint who killed on impulse. Many find this to be hypocritical after everything he has done but Joe does not want to be a murderer, in fact his whole character growth of season 2 was based around changing his ways and being better. This is why he pushed the key through the hole when he thought he killed Delilah. He thought he was responsible for her death and that he was just gaslighting himself about being a better man. Love was the embodiment of everything about his past self that he hated and wanted to change staring right back at him. In season 3 we see Joe continue to try to be this better version of himself (minus the stalking) but Love shows no such goals. She is hypocritical, selfish, and blatantly impulsive. Killing anyone who hurts her feelings and refusing to take any responsibility for her actions. Idk how you think Joe was the problem with season 3.
Love was absolutely a murderer also though...
This is true. I am one of these people.

I think the reason is that they went to couples counseling, and you can see that after they realized how similar they were there was some hope they would at least work together as a team.

As Sherry even pointed out, marriage takes a lot of work and sometimes you don't always love your partner every day.

But yeah...the show is a painful reminder that Joe isn't going to change...but the next issue is...if Joe isn't going to change, and we all agree he's not a good person...is this going to end with him always getting away with it, or will it finally come bite him in the ass in the end?
The one thing I did like was Victoria Pedretti's excellent portrayal of the monotone, dead-eyed suburban housewife. She did a very good job with that. Love was such a free spirit when she lived in LA, and as Season 3 progressed you could clearly see the change in her.
I agree I feel like she was in the wrong a lot this whole season and couldn't admit to anything she did wrong.
Finally someone called her out on her hypocrisy
I could not stand her this season, and I know they’re both shitty but she’s so hypocritical and manipulative towards everyone
I was looking for this comment! Love was horrible. She made these rash decisions. With Nathalie, with Gil, screaming when Sherry and Cary where in the house. This is where I am watching the show now, I just had to rant somewhere before continuing watching.

My god is she just stupid? Then she blames Joe for everything and tries to say her killing is the same as his. Or kills someone and then tells Joe to fix it. I was over her when she tried to frame Ellie but now Im just honing Joe kills her, takes that baby and run. 

Okay rant over. Thanks for being the only one for being over Love lol.

Btw I know its just a tv show but I really hate watching someone that dumb. Its the 'I hear a noise outside, its dark and Im alone, lets go out and see what is' effect to me. Same dumbness. Okay rant really over now...
when sherry was trying to appeal to her in the cage and was like "kill Joe" and Love was like "you're a monster" like giiiiiirl lmao
How can we expect Love to be bloody normal? If she was, she wouldn’t do all the screwed-up stuff. You know she has mental disorder by season 2 but damn, you can’t treat someone like her as normal.

Victoria acting is definitely “don’t put your dick into crazy”. She portray it well.
I think the writers want us to go on the same journey as Joe does, falling into and out of love with Love
Honestly much preferred exploring her brand of crazy, particularly as Joe's brand of crazy has gotten so stale. Honestly will be sad to see her go, especially if we're just in for yet another season of this dude somehow getting away with a bunch more murders because he saw a pretty girl who likes to read.
This 1000x
I found them both annoying and hypocritical this season. Joe could do no wrong either, every time he killed, it was fine and he was in the right. If she did, she was crazy. They both were cheating, but I do feel like overall she wanted the relationship to work, where Joe was just looking for an escape. I was still team Love, but hated the nextdoor kid thing she had going on.
>love was so much more annoying in this season. like i know they’re bad people but sometimes her hypocrisy was too much for me. 

I found Joe to be FAR more of a hypocrite than Love in this season. I also found him generally more annoying. It's funny how differently different people can interpret the same show.
Thank you!! Good god, she was grating on my last nerve this season. Not only was she a hypocrite but she gaslit Joe at every opportunity and would blow up at him randomly.
I think this season was highlighting how they brought out the worst in each other.
Joe is the biggest hypocrite of them all though. 

"I will kill anyone to be with you Love"

"I will kill anyone to be with you Joe" 

"Ew"
i dont get why so many people like love more than joe in this season, dont get me wrong i hate them both but at least we can see that hes trying to change for his son , he didnt even kill anyone till stupid ryan. and there is love who is impulsive as fuck, killed natalie cuz she was jealous in FIRST EPISODE called joe right after then started to panic and let him deal with that, then almost killed gill and also let joe handle that. the only thing she is good at is being manipulative and blaming Joe for everything even if its her fault.
 dont get me started on that fucking orgy foursome deal. she wanted that in the first place, joe did that for her and then she had a problem with that in the middle of fucking orgy or whatever, then she blames Joe (again), yelled at him about killing natalie while her friends are right upstairs and guess what? joe had to handle that again. and lets just mention that she cheated on him too with fucking teenager boy who she also tried to kill lol
i just cant handle her and people who are defending her, almost everything bad happened because shes too impulsive and cant take a fucking 5 minutes to think about anything
i dont blame Joe that he killed her cuz she tried to do the same thing to him, just like she killed her ex husband but Joe was smarter
fuck love
Maybe as a way of giving even more spotlight to Joe and Love’s marital/intimacy issues? Even when they had sex, the both of them were never fully present until that one scene towards the very end with all the blood when Joe says “that’s the best sex we’ve ever had” (can’t remember what episode).
I noticed that too. So much more sex than the past seasons. I wasn’t against it but agree there was definitely more.
Right I started to feel like the only part of their relationship that they thought needed fixing was their sex life.
Too little sex with Theo in it. :( Buuuuu
Right? I feel like everyone, but Dante, had a sex scene. Most of them felt cheap
I was surprised that Love was feeling sexually frustrated. I’m like… how much more do you want? lol
I honestly to me all sex scenes felt cringy and cheap even the one that  Joe claimed to be their best sex.
I noticed a lot more cussing too.
Because the plot line wasn’t interesting enough. They had to pad it.
because the writers are running out of ideas
Yeah some of those scenes were just a bit odd, cringey more than anything
It’s the Netflix formula. If a show makes it to season 3 you get way more nude scenes or sex scenes. Then if the show makes it to season 4 they piss off the core fan base by making the characters completely different. Season 4 is usually the end.
So much!!
as someone who is on the ace spectrum, yes. way too much. i got bored and played my switch through a lot of it
the only thing great about joe >!moving to paris!< is his outfit and how he just took a shot of that >!espresso!< like it was a >!tequila!< lol im loving this censorship
I feel like I'm watching an extremely cheesy soap opera sometimes, but I can't stop!
agreeeeeeeeeed
Maybe he’ll meet Emily there (in Paris)😂🥐
I felt like it just added to the whole “look how fake everyone in this town is” thing
That was the point; Sherry's whole character is a commentary on influencers who use other people's lives as props for their social media brand, and perhaps to some extent the kind of family vloggers that use their own kids for clout. She did seem to love her children but she is very narcissistic as well
I think that’s kinda the point.
Probably covid restrcitions
😂
That's kind of the point. She is an ideal mum on the Internet but not so in real life.
>I think Love Quinn was the most interesting girl Joe has been obsessed with and sadly nobody will be able to follow up with her. Any new girl Joe obsesses over (Natalie, Marianne, etc.) just can’t compare and feels like a cheap imitation. 

I agree. It felt like there was some actual nuance with Love; while with the other girls, it was just a game of him stalking a girl and removing any friction with crime until they fall in love before his actions fuck it all up. Becoming partners with someone as fucked as him is kind of perfect. For him to then leave it all for another random girl with an unremarkable backstory...ehhh it just felt like a lack of development; both character-wise and at an overall plot level. Definitely not a loop I'd want to see in Season 4.

It is like if Spiderman faced off against a planetary threat with everything at stake, but then in the sequel he is just facing off against the local crime boss. You'd think there'd at least be some kind of twist besides just a enemy/girl of the week.
Yes season 1 was smart and well written and I believe it was the best. Love's actress was better than Beck but Beck is hated here but her life and motivation was so millennial like and normal. Also nice chemistry.
Yeah i'm pretty disappointed with how they played out this season as well. It seems like they chose the suburban setting just to shit on it which makes 0 sense whatsoever. I really didn't get the whole "this place is purgatory" or "it's heaven but feels like hell" thing as it's clearly such "rich people, they're just like us" bs. 

I was interested in seeing what Love could do with the money/connections she had at her disposal in the following season. Too bad they killed her off. It seems like they're trying to start at square 1 to prolong the show but I think that'll end up killing it.
They should do an alternative ending like the last 2 episodes and >!spoiler! make it a happy one where they fix it and stay together or just redo the first 3 episodes as like and alternate season literally just 3 episodes they clap Natalie clean up and that’s the happily ever after I’m so sad I only cried at the end when joe killed love !spoiler!<
I must be in the minority, because I absolutely loved season three. Season two was actually my least favorite.
Complete agree, could not have said it better myself
[deleted]
I wanted both Joe and Love to die at the end
I wish Love's ending had been unclear so she could've come back in the series finale and put an end to him.  Or at least kept us wondering if she would.
The piss jar in Peach's house that never came back to haunt Joe still lingers on my mind
I hope they don’t resurrect Peach like that, but I always enjoy the allusions back to her, because I find it hilarious that Joe is still competing with her in a sense and hasn’t gotten her out of his head entirely, possibly even more than Beck. Their hatred for one another over Beck was God tier, and I loved the “I’ve never been a part of a threesome… unless you count Peach Salinger” line. So good
I love Peach but that would be really stretching this story too far and thin, a total shark-jump moment.  I hope not.
I think peach and Marianne have similar features.
I think I counted 4 Peach mentions. Edit: and 4 “athleisure” uses too.
From what I remember Peach’s family hired a private detective? What happened to that? Do you guys think it’s lingering in the back and the FBI are onto Joe? 🤔
That's impossible. If that were the case, Peach would have told the police about Joe
I actually forgot who peach was expecting it to be someone from season 2 considering she was mentioned so much. I had to google it to find she was from season one and I got so confused lol
I think season 4 will bring all of that back into play now that he was back to Joe Goldberg in S3 and his name will have been all over the news. His past mistakes and loose ends finally catching up with him?
I thought it was a nod to gossip girl, like how they mentioned “queen bee” this season as well.
Doesn't make sense. Moving on. Fuck off
It's bs though that Theo didn't die, considering how much blood he lost.
I LOVED MATTHEW . If anything, Love should’ve had the affair with him. Although his characters demeanor was not set up for that at all.
Theo was just young and dumb. But I’m surprised by Loves imaginary line between killing a young knight type and a random woman her husband was fucking.
I am extremely disappointed they didn't
I really liked the scene where you can see the change in theo’s face where you can see he’s gonna get the cops… in my mind it wasn’t a done deal until Love said something to set him off…

I’m glad joe let him live
People who are trapped in cage for quite sometime might not make the best decisions. They are slowly deprived of care. It’s hard at times to make good decisions under tremendous amount of stress.
Theo immediately started defending Love so maybe they realized they had a better chance asking him to get the key rather than turn Love in.
Yes 100% this. Why did Theo not just do this in the first place? Call the cops!!!
I felt the same way! I would NOT have had him waste any time looking for a key that may not have even existed. Get out your phone and call the cops!
I mean she \*did\* just have a baby. Someone who clearly has mental issues, family issues, co-dependency issues... I can't imagine the amount of postpartum shit they would go through. This was definitely shown when she hit Gil.
I think you hit the nail on the head for Love to me. At the end of Season 2, Love is obviously a murderer, but she has her shit together. She understands that she and Joe are super fucking lucky that they both found eachother, while Joe is being a hypocrite.

In this season though, she just doesn't have any composure at all, is too busy banging a teenager, and becomes a hypocrite herself with regards to Joe's affair.
[deleted]
I feel it’s represents the truth of one’s character as each person learns to be comfortable showing their true colours to their other partner in a marriage. This season was interesting to me bc the construct of marriage changed the dynamic of joe and love individually.
Agreed. This season was better than season 2.
People don't like change I really liked this season! Yeah I understand why they don't like it but these pushes needed to happen and it makes you think a lot (maybe I am biased cuz I am becoming a psychologist) but I absolutely loved the whole analyzing part of this show and the characters
I really liked this season. It was a very interesting change how Joe went from being alone in his murderous quest for the perfect life, to mostly cleaning up after Love’s messes.
It sucked tbh.
Felt like it jumped the shark in a lot of ways to me.
I thought that too, it could have been perfect, and I really wanted it to happen because I loved them together.

But then I was thinking more on it and I don’t think Love could have coped with knowing Joe was screwing other women. She’s jealous and that fuels a lot of her killing. Joe would have tolerated it for the sake of whoever his new true love was and his kid. But they never got the chance because Love realised he was obsessed with someone else again and then they started fighting and yelling across the house that she killed xyz people for him. 

They really were perfect for each other.
I thought it would become a game to them of luring people back so they can kill together and then have sex. And a cat and mouse style police investigation
I really wanted to see the show go into this direction. It really would have been a lot more interesting to see them fall into the "okay compression, marriage as commitment rather than infatuation" and become a model couple from the outsider's perspective. And them having to live with this horror and also being on edge with each other forever. Joe seemed to be getting there with the reflection for a few moments in the middle of the season, and for Love it was there already.

I really think it could have been fantastic if Love outsmarted Joe and forced him to see all of this. Anything along the lines of them working it out or recognizing that they're the same person. I don't understand why they started to lie to each other in this season because they had already both felt fully seen.
I also thought it was going in this direction and was looking forward to it. But then it flipped real quick lol
This reminded me of this old Japanese romance film where the girl was a psycho(yandere) and did all sorts of crazy shit to get to the boy. At the end the boy is revealed to be a psycho as well and enamored with her, the girl immediately lost all romantic feelings in him and thought he's a fucking creep.
He does that alot. I remember in season 1 where he was complaining in his head about how creepy Peach was for watching Becks in the bath without her knowing, but he literally watched/monitored the whole time. I was like, Joe...you really need to look in the mirror, bud. lol
They just have different triggers, and Joe plans out his targets, most of the time. When Joe kills he justifies it, when Love does it she doesn't have an inner monologue to it. Both of them are equally as bad, but love is more unhinged.
His self awareness is zero and he takes the term hypocrisy to a whole new level
I know right?! Going on about how he has to get his son away from the psycho mom while he's right in the middle of murdering someone. I don't understand how anyone can sympathize with him ever, I hate him so fucking much lol
Almost like serial killers are bad people who don't like to acknowledge their flaws.
That’s literally the point. He’s not like-able. He’s crazy. Not sure why people in this thread seem to think he’s a good guy in any way shape or form… you’re not supposed to root for him. He literally kills people lmao.
One of my favourite parts of the two first seasons is when he in his head says "this person is dangerous" to his love interest while ignoring how he himself always ends up killing them.
I know right, it's the funniest shit

These two are so self-unaware it's hysterical
he is definately way less of a psycho than love
Ikr like she is literally the female version of him but I kind of get him because love was REALLY CRAZY THIS SEASON
No not at all
It's because he views it as that he actually carefully plans things out while hers are purely impulsive. They both kill but for different reasons
Love is directly responsible for every death in Season 3 and Joe has to clean her mess up every time.
Joe was proactively trying to become a better man and change his ways. Love was unhinged, selfish, hypocritical, and impulsive. She murdered a woman with an axe because of a small kiss that Joe rejected then proceeded to have a full blown affair with a teenager, whom she also attempted to kill... Joe had to repeatedly clean up her messes that she would create then blame him for so he could protect their child. Love has no restraint and was just annoying asf. I was hoping she would die wayyyy earlier in the season. She was great in season 2 and I understood her killing Candice but season 3 Love just needed to go.
That’s literally the point though. It shows how delusional joe is that he genuinely rationalizes stuff in his head and doesn’t think he’s crazy
I disagree. Joe wouldn't have killed Delilah, because he knew Ellie needed her. He had true compassion for Ellie, as a young kid who he empathized with. He started seeing Love in a whole new light as soon as he found out about how she killed Delilah. It's the rich-girl entitlement that set her apart, and in my opinion made her more evil.
Most of the situations they got into in s3 was directly because of love though, and Joe was left to pick up the pieces. I think he really wanted to get out of that situation with her to pursue a better life, he was just terrified of love killing him and Maryanne
Part of me wanted Love to kill Joe and then become the narrator of S4.
I’m fully with you. Also love is hot?!?!! Like Joe’s creepy gaslighty misogynistic vibe is getting v old and I wanted love to get her revenge. there’s so much more to explore with loves character. Like we get it joe u have mommy issues and don’t view women as people
Yeah but Joe is the main character and it would probably make a lot of people mad if that shifted to Love. Plus if that happened there would be nothing to write since Love only kills for her family and I can’t see anything else that could happen in season4 to make her kill. We’ve seen numerous times that love can’t kill and get away with it completely on her own like Joe.
It’s interesting that u watch the show wanting him to be arrested and meanwhile I’m weirdly anxious that he’ll get caught/arrested. 

And that’s super screwed up, if he was a real life person obviously i would want him behind bars
Agreed completely - I get "suspend your disbelief" as a concept, but it reaches such a ridiculous level in this show regarding Joe always getting out unscathed and being a criminal mastermind. He's an incredibly smart guy, to be sure, but also he makes so many mistakes and leaves so many paper trails that it's just not remotely believable at this point that nothing *ever* happens to him.

Also, when he was in the cafe in>! the end sans any disguise, not even grown out hair or contacts or just SOMETHING, I straight up asked out loud, "Are you kidding me?!" Paris is RIFE with American tourists and some Europeans do keep tabs on American pop culture. Surely someone would have recognized him given his affiliation with the Quinns...but this is just one example in a sea of little plot holes. Show be looking like Swiss cheese at this point.!<
he never even changed his name (this time) surely someone will have found the paper trail by now...people die wherever he goes
Exactly. I think that the only people being able to do that are calculative serial killers, but Joe just kills people in a heartbeat in the middle of a city full of cameras and noisy neighbors, and nothing happens
Dexter Morgan did it for like 8 years but I guess he did do all that before we entered the modern age of technology lol
Honestly I was hoping he'd finally get arrested this season. I enjoy the show (even if it's not always great), but I'm getting tired of it: like everyone else is saying, Joe is getting so predictable that the storyline is pretty boring at this point. Adding Love to the mix definitely saved this season, but I was hoping he'd at least get caught so it'd finally be over. I know we're put in the position to kind of root for him, but I was honestly just ready for the show to be over and for the "world" (in the show) to finally discover all the shit he did.
Idk, I kinda like that he’s always one step ahead… I mean if he hadn’t of been >!love would’ve killed him instead of the other way around!< even her mom knew
Honestly I don't really know how to feel about this season.
The plot twists were solid. 
I was disappointed to see love die she was Joe's soulmate there's no way he finds someone else who can understand him.
Yeah, getting rid of both Love and Henry made it feel like they just want back to the status quo of the first season. Joe being a random guy by himself living in some place and potentially meeting a new girl. 

Quite honestly,  I don't see how they can milk the concept for that long. The only reason I feel like Season 2 succeed was because how they filpped the script with the twist of Love being a psycopath. Instead of feeling like they were just recycling the storyline, it felt like a smart move to have the romantic interest being crazy as well. One of the reasons I wasn't that excited for Season 3 it was mostly because I felt like they were just gonna milk the concept with Joe being in love with the neighbour and thinking of ways to get rid of Love.


What made me excited while watching the first episode this season was because they managed to surprise me again with Love killing the neighbour right away and then the next episode focusing on Joe and Love fixing their relationship. It felt interesting, new and a great direction for the season.

But then in second half of Season 3, they decide to actually do what I believe they were gonna do before the season even premiered.
I honestly wouldn't mind if they didn't already renew it for a fourth.. This season was okay. Underwhelming. I have mixed feelings about it. I don't want to see Joe getting obsessed with another girl, inevitably killing her and people involved in her life. It could go one of two ways, he kills the new obsession or they fall in love and she accepts him but they already have done both of those things. If they wanted to continue the series they shouldn't have killed Love off. Simply put. If they were happy ending it at season 3 which I would have been fine with, it would have been an interesting ending. But being that they're carrying on to a season 4? I think it's getting redundant and repetitive.
>They killed Natalie so quick she could have been an interesting character

To me this was one of the smartest things they did. The idea of Joe stalking yet another hot woman who likes to read bored me to tears. That they subverted expectations and had Love off her immediately had me bought in. That they then go back on this by having Joe just do it again further down the line was disappointing.
> Scott Speedman

Holy fuck I thought he was Anthony Starr, same thing in Animal Kingdom. They fucking look to similar!
The thing about Henry… the writers maybe saw how Dexter handled having a baby with a serial killer, and it just doesn’t work. Too much care needed to be obsessive and crazy.
I still can't believe that they killed Love.
Honestly I think the best twist would have been for Joe to die and do the final season with Love as the main character if they HAD to kill one of them, then some final demise with the past catching up to her or something. I don't think I could have an interest in season 4 with no Love.
I think the one redeemable thing Joe did this season (other than not killing that college kid) was leave Henry with that couple. I really didn't like how Dexter handled that and when I think of how creepy and awful Joe is I would hate him for having a kid be around that. Him letting Henry go showed he at least has some self awareness.
Having Henry with him would have been interesting but it would have dissolved the character development. Everything Joe did in S3 he was doing to protect Henry and in the end he realised that protecting Henry meant leaving him behind.
Glad he didn’t take Henry. I remember at the end thinking, i haven’t seen this baby in 3 episodes.
Definitely wasted Scott Michael Foster too. The man has so much RANGE.
I only recognize Scott Speedman from Grey’s Anatomy so it’s interesting to see him in a more dramatic role
Not really, only thing cool was the mystery and Marienne is way more likable and interesting
Did you not think to include that there was spoilers?
Couldn't agree more. Frankly she became a much more compelling character than Joe and the dynamic between the two of them was electric. I don't see how Season 4 can possibly compare without her.
indeed this season felt like i was mentally fast forwarding till i could get to what love was doing.
She’s not dead
I wish she had just disappeared so we could always wonder where she was and if she was interfering with his prospects.
I just hope they read these reviews and think of a drastic save.. Otherwise season 4 is pointless. I can't watch this cycle go on any longer!!
I thought joe was gonna become obsessed with the therapist lol
Agreed with some of your points, but I will say being self aware about your issues doesn’t always (or even often) mean those issues just go away. Like I’m very aware of some of my unhealthy behavior patterns and even why I have them, but it’s still hard to break out of them lol
Y’all are so unrealistic lmao. Lots of couples stop therapy because they “think they’re ok” it’s like the most common outcome of couple’s therapy. 

Him having moments of pure awareness for the first time ever finally and reverting back to his nature is realistic. Extremely realistic
That man is a murderous sociopath that needs actual psychiatric help before he can maybe start to get better and y'all think therapy was gonna do shit for him and his relationship with a woman he doesn't actually love because he's incapable of it? Lmao
My problem with this season is that he obsessed over Natalie and they decide to do in therapy because of their issues. Things get better, Joe starts feeling and acting like a dad, they stop therapy, and I'm back to watching the exact same issues of the first part of the season, minus the dad thing.
With the therapy, I feel like that might be common with toxic relationships or ones that are doomed to fail. Instead of doing the work, one has already checked out or think only a few sessions are enough to show they “tried”…clearly knowing they’re halfway out the door. They tried to apply logic to a clearly illogical relationship.
I mean, Joe is a murderous psychopath so I'd be pretty upset if they tried to redeem the character of someone so evil.
>And Joe understanding that his obsession with stalking broken women is a result of abandonment issues but still choosing to go down that path is beyond me. 

Knowing the source of one's pathological behavior doesn't suddenly break the cycle of the behavior. That's a fiction that tv likes to promote, as if that "Come to Jesus" moment undoes years of trained dependance on certain actions and the feelings they provide. And Joe has from the very beginning been very good at demonstrating \*just\* enough self-awareness to justify his behavior. Joe gets off on what he does and knowing why he does it won't change anything.
Psychopaths don’t have character arcs. They might have moments of conscience but that’s it. Sorry to disappoint you
Loved this season & the ending!
Killing Love feels really underwhelming too. If they wanted a season 4 I'd rather have them both flee with Henry, covering up each other's murders and living on the edge abroad.

Also kind of wish Joe had some kind of reaction to Theo. He went from hating Love, to loving her again, to hating, to loving (very emotionally volatile) to just being bored and then just wanting her gone. It felt jarring.
Ikr and just few months back he used to be obsessed with Love.I am going to miss love so much 🥺
I had high hopes for them after Marriage counseling and I really thought they were going to work out and be a little murdery team, but then Joe got bored again. I really enjoyed the moment when they both began to understand the other.
But it's kind of realistic? You can't fix your relationship without working on your own issues? They both never did therapy to help them overcome their past.
I did notice they used the AA meeting stalk/relapse plan like in book 3 and Marienne worked at a book store like Mary Kay in book 3 but besides that ...
Could you please give me a little run down of the differences in the book?
[deleted]
I think I've seen this film before...
I really hate the ending.... nothing made sense..
I honestly thought that after hearing about Penn getting in some kind of Me Too trouble between seasons that they might have the balls to kill off their main character and have Love take the mantle. That thought had me on the edge of my seat all season. (Especially when we started hearing her inner monolog)

And the Dexter parallels continue with a season about rejecting a lover who looks a little too close to one's self in the mirror that ends in Paris.
I absolutely LOVED Love’s character. The interaction and dynamic between her and Joe was absolutely great and Victoria Pedretti is an exceptional actor. 

I know it’s completely unrealistic and I did like how it was wrapped up if she had to go, but I would be super stoked if for S4 there’s a plot where she managed to get out and also play dead like Joe is.
As upsetting as it was with Love dying, it was also unfortunate that the show essentially did a soft-reset on how it'll go about things (at least, that's what the ending ultimately appears to be). I most likely won't be watching Season 4 unless it's the final season and/or if Love returns.  


It's as if the show refuses to change or evolve...which might actually be genius, as that's kind of an analogy as well for Joe Goldberg.
Yeah I kinda wish we could have seen what it was like to see them as divorced serial killers co parenting. That would have been a new dynamic! (Admittedly not sure how it would have worked tho lol)
[deleted]
Girls are less likely to be psychopaths and murder people. That’s why . And yea, love is like that. She’s a rarity. There aren’t many female killers. And almost all kill their husbands or children, rather than other people
Joe has a bit of a Madonna complex.
I think it's so that Joe's stalking/protective fantasies could have transferred onto a daugher and he could free himself from his cycle
Whats joes hold up on having did want a baby wench so lacking valor?

I was gonna say the same thing. On episode 6 and not feeling as on the edge of my seat as before.
I felt this season was so much more boring. Most of the characters weren’t likable/didn’t grow on me.
I feel it's very bad. The reason is obvious. They're not as good as the author.  
Season 1 and 2 are under her control. But Season 3 is a gap between book 2 and 3.  
That's how I feel about The Witcher too.  
I think it's difficult for them. If you are that good, you can be the author herself. But obviously they aren't.  
I just feel they shouldn't try to make this season. Just do the book 3.
Correct me if I’m wrong. But I think the new writers are the same as riverdale a new writers. (If that is the case) because riverdale has gotten hate from it changing so differently, the writers are staying with the already used storyline for YOU
Exactly. It used to be a well written on the edge of your seat show. Suddenly soap opera.
Honestly this feels like 2 different writers each wrote their version of S3 and then the two got mashed together into what we got.
wow i find this really interesting perspective because i also felt like they changed writers, but in a good way. i loved the dark humour and even though there were flaws like any show, it had me way more invested then s2.
I think it’s more so that for the first season it was based off of the book, second season was semi based, and third season wasn’t based on anything but minor plot points of book 3. 
I think without concrete outlining it can just go anywhere and they are unable to think of anything that furthers the plot, and is new that doesn’t feel already rehashed. 

Book 3 for me was okay, wasn’t my favorite but was a continued tragedy for Joe feeling like everything he touches dies.
I feel like she is dead. Her eye stopped when she said the last sentence about Henry. I think at this point, her storyline is over. Like what else can they write about Love and Joe? And they've done the  "coming back from the dead" with Candace.
I would like to be proven wrong tho, I like Love and Joe's dynamic, especially when they are working like a team.
I THINK she’s dead but I wouldn’t be shocked if Love comes back next season. There was a lot of “wow Love is so good at this” throughout the season that could be foreshadowing, like is Joe really smarter than Love or is she the one who was two steps ahead? Plus I thought so many people were dead this season who actually weren’t. Also there are some really interesting and funny storylines they could do with Love coming back from the dead.
I think she is dead. The way she cared for her baby makes me think if she wasn’t dead, she would’ve done anything to get her baby back.
There’s article that says murder suicide and I doubt that would be an article if her body wasn’t found.
I think she is dead. She was blindsided and Joe also set the house on fire.
I wish, but we see her body moments before the house burst in flames, and I think they even mentioned that the only thing they couldn't find was Joe's body. It would be too cheeky to revive her now.  
Also, even if she built up a resistance, the house burnt a few minutes after she laid down, while Joe took more than 15 min to recover even with the antidote
Didn't he burn her to death? After him faking his paralysis you'd think he'd check for a pulse
I think that was Love’s downfall, is that she was so impulsive. She was a bit calculated with the hidden key and the wolfsbane in the garden/on the knife, but throughout the series she’s never been more than one step ahead because she allows her emotions to control her actions (which I hate as a stereotype of women but seems to be the case here). For instance, she was fully going to kill
Marienne out of jealousy and rage until her daughter walked in and Love realized she couldn’t take her away from her daughter.
If Love wasn’t dead, the baby would be back to her and there wouldn’t be an article telling about her death. 

I am sure that Joe confirms she’s dead. The dude overdosed her with Wolfsbane. 

Damn, Love looks to me she has borderline personality disorder? I recall these people are really difficult to deal with.
This is one of the more well-thought-out posts on this thread, honestly
I think it was implied that he gaslit her into questioning everything about herself, which led her in a downward spiral of making terrible decisions in the hopes that he'd sympathize with her or at least respect her power (aka. capacity to be just like him).
If you think about it through the lens of Joe as our unreliable narrator, it makes a lot more sense & is a lot more enjoyable. Imagine that we are seeing everything through Joe's perspective. Through most of season two, Love is his obsession, his perfect woman. He justifies & explains away even her foibles & annoyances. Then it's revealed at the end that she's a stone cold killer, just like him, & the illusion is shattered. Now he's seeing her as basically a ticking time bomb, a threat to be managed. Even her kills look sloppy, impulsive, & irrational compared to his because Joe is a master at justifying his own behavior & that of the people within his bubble (his obsessions), & Love is OUTSIDE the bubble now. We aren't seeing the events through the lens of an omnipotent objective eye in the sky. It's all being filtered through Joe's extremely prejudiced viewpoint. In that light, the writing is kind of brilliant.
They made love seem less stable this season probably just so they could write her off the show before next season. Cause she definitely wasn't that bad in season 2.
One argument I could use is that Matthew never left his office and never went out so he probably didn’t know about that camera even though it was always in front of his eyes.
I think he was just about to discover that camera before shutting down. Luckily Theo knew the position of that camera and caught it soon after.
massive plot hole, tru
She was already pretty awful tbh
I don’t think they ruined her at all. This is exactly how she’s been from season 2. The only difference being is that she has two people now instead of one to obsess over like she did with Forty, and Joe quite literally brings out the worst in her. He enables her murderous tendencies where Forty sort of… dissuaded them, in a sense. 

If anything, this season has confirmed why I personally disliked her when the reveal happened in season 2. The fact that Joe is even more sympathetic now is frankly alarming. She literally makes him look like a kitten.
Ppl keep complaining about S3 must because they aren’t married to understand family issues mentioned there. 

 I think we all saw something familiar here somehow. It’s very common to happen in any couple. Which is why I love to see how Joe deal with it. 

Stuck in a marriage and try to get out is the feeling everyone may have at one point of life.
Now I want Theo and Ellie to meet! I was sure she'd be investigating her sister's death and waiting for the right moment to avenge.
Well the cops and pi havent seen previous seasons of you so i think he is fine
the cops aren't going to link Peach with Gil and Love. They're also going to work on the basis that Love wrote both Gil and her own as for the similar writing style
I loved the body count and overall soapy feel! 

It’s absurd that this good-looking dude would get away with two huge nationally-covered murder scandals without having eyes on him. Like, the premise is so ridiculous that silliness doesn’t take away from my enjoyment at all.
Was the body count really that high compared to previous seasons? There were a bunch of fakeouts but technically there were only 3 murders between the two leads right? Plus one revealed past murder.
I interpreted everyone being so unlikable was because they were living in the suburbs. The suburbs was suppose to convey that everyone is bored so they all talk shit about each other, create drama, and swing because there’s simply nothing else interesting there. 

I could be reading more into it or it could just be bad writing because I didn’t enjoy the characters either and missed the lovable side characters in the previous seasons.
Even the interesting beginning feel off somehow and from the middle it was terrible. It's like they had no clue what to do. I feel like season 1 was the best.
>connects the moment he saved his mother from her abuser with her simultaneous abandonment of him, which is why he tries literally everything to help those he becomes obsessed with away from their view.

This is a really great insight, i'd never thought of it like that before!
Excellent comments!
wish i could upvote this 1000 times omg
I did keto for a long time and yeah I don’t doubt I was annoying about it. I think being that restrictive is generally difficult to be quiet about.
If you’re bringing it up then yeah, you probably are 😆
Hahahaha I love your self reflection. You probably do. But I’m a vegan so you know I talk too much about my diet.
If you have to wonder, yeah, probably.  I don’t give a fuck what anyone else eats.
You do
Same!
While I personally do tip Uber drivers for principle as a former customer service employee, it's hard for me to blame people for not tipping their drivers. Uber rates are absolutely absurd, I've had to spend over $100 for 15 minute rides on multiple occasions. I'd be more okay with it if the driver got more than the like 10% cut that Uber gives them, but Uber is greedy af and takes basically all of it. It's criminal what they're doing and if there's any industry that should move away from relying on tips for pay, it's Uber drivers
I’ve been using Uber for years and I never knew you could tip.
Ugh and the library bookworm thing is so overplayed in my opinion. It would have been much more interesting to see Joe reinvent himself completely & perfect his psychopathic covers throughout the season rather than wear the same boring cringey 1950s outfits he wears
My guess is it's on purpose as to remind us that Joe is an unreliable narrator, but who knows.
They do it in other seasons too. I noticed it during my rewatch. I think it's on purpose, but it is jarring.
Yes, they overdid this effect so much, it was very distracting and it looks stupid.
I thought I need new glasses
They've been doing that s1 I believe
No this is VERY relevant and I was asking all of the same questions
Yeah it went against the whole point of her character. She would do anything to keep Joe because she was obsessed with him, They kind of confused that this season by making it unclear if she wanted him or not in some scenes.
That was my biggest pet peeve, and there was zero pay-off to it. They literally could have cut that out and it wouldn’t change a thing. Joe doesn’t even react to it when he finds out. Love still wants to “talk it out” at their final dinner regardless of if Joe knew it or not. It was completely inconsequential.
Same, they were hilarious
This is my hope too! She did give him shit for the Candace mistake in the beginning episodes so it would be great to see that play out. He does repeat his usual patterns and it feels like he rarely learns from his mistakes
LMAO I shouldn’t have been on this sub. I’m on episode 2. JOE KILLS LOVE? lmfaooo good honestly she’s insanely annoying
Joe has a savior complex where he feels the need to protect the girls he sees as helpless. A daughter is probably as helpless and dependent as he’ll ever get
Who takes way too long to respond in a conversation. Creepy much?
It felt like “>”!Marianne!”<“ was unnecessary addition. Joe didn’t seem to click with her like he did with Beck or Love. 
I don’t know if I am the only one who feels that way
I had hoped they would work it out, it was so sad. Wtf.
Fr, I wanted them to make it as a couple, fuck joe.
[removed]
Why did he kill love? Because she was about to kill him

Idk how u people thought love was making it to the next season
They ruined the show for me by killing Love. Joe and Love were perfect for each other.
"I'm at 6% bodyfat" had me rolling
The way he said "I am a feminist", my god 😂
Him and Sherry were the only reason I kept watching the second half of the season
It’s always been ridiculous and that was part of its charm but they kicked it up to 11 and it became comic book level ridiculous
i don’t think it was ever intended to be a realistic drama lol
This show has been like that since season one. I think its just a stylistic choice.
Maybe it is supposed to reflect Joe's "tunnel vision" when he becomes obsessed with one of his targets.
Same, I thought something was wrong with my TV at first. It didn't really do anything for me except take me out of focus (ironically)
Seriously! I thought something was wrong with my eyes
Every Netflix original show is like that. I don't know why but it drives me crazy.
I noticed it more in this season than any other season of YOU. I was like wtf is going on
No i noticed it too. I specifically say “I hate how the corners look like the mr Krabs meme”
Lol @ "I don’t even want to watch the next season because I feel like it’s just going to be me watching Joe obsess over another crush and fucking stalk people with his stupid hat (as if the hat makes him fucking invisible)"

Stupid invisibility hat🤣🤣🤣
I really hope that Theo saves the day but I feel like they’re gonna completely dispose of that plot line like they did w Karen Minty, Ellie, etc. I was so excited for this season but it’s getting harder w how they’re trying to paint Joe as sympathetic. Also making the woman the over-emotional, impulsive and “stupid/sloppy” killer feels wrong. God forbid the man be depicted as the TRUE villain
Maybe I'm the crazy one cuz this season made me root for Love and absolutely hate Joe. I took her actions more in a visceral, momma-bear protecting her family sort of way. I actually liked seeing Love as a mom.
I never liked Joe. The whole "victim" storyline of him getting bullied at school is such a weak attempt at a victim backstory. And he's narrating it as if he is the only person on earth to get pushed around by a few annoying kids & it somehow justifies murder? lmao come on

I'm literally watching just to see him get caught or get killed at this point. He's insufferable.
Yes cringe fest. While I appreciate that they emasculated Joe to the level that he won't be "hot psycho" anymore but they took Love to another level and he was pathetic helping to cover up. Then it got worse. The writers didn't know and made a mistake of Joe being so so over Love. They worked with love hate dynamic but mostly team. Not given a chance. Also in s1 he is running from the police and this season all is well.
I REALLY thought Marianne and Ryan were investigators following up on everything from LA or maybe even working with the hot PI that Peach's family hired. Ryan catching him on his shit all the time, the drugs not working etc etc I was like fiiiinally he's met his match this will be a fun dance. But no, Joe and his almighty hat come out on top yet again.

Also this show and fingers. Why two?? Why not like just one. Or the tip of one jeez
There are a few plot holes indeed or maybe I need to rewatch unless someone here explains—how was there no surveillance of Joe arriving at the bakery when Love called him after she killed Natalie? There is a time skip.

Also agreed how Theo is the only one who looked at footage from across rhe street—

I’m also thinking of reading the books but from what I saw of the first book, Joe is way more the insufferable one.
Exactly this!!! Honestly though even if he’d decided to call the cops, Love would’ve just come back when he was dialing :\. Nothing can win against the writers deciding someone gets caught.
Yes, I completely agree! I think they were told they were being renewed for another season halfway through writing season 3 and decided to bring it back to square one somehow.
Agreed... once Natalie died it felt like they were flipping the script. Then once Joe became obsessed with Marienne it felt so stale again. The only things that saved the later episodes (for me) were Sherry and Cary, because those two were hilarious and also had a fascinating relationship.
Yes. So Love got at first all the murders and writers didn't know what to do with Joe. The storyline was so uninteresting but they also chose a terrible actress.
Ye I agree. The first 4 eps or so kept me hooked but when Joe you-d Marienne I didn't enjoy it as much.
yes their back and forth on marriage the young kid. Nothing was at stake too much drama I already forgot. I disliked Marienne. I blame writing and the actress. She just can't pull this off.
His character was the most boring and useless one in all honesty. It's a good storyline with his dad but the entire season of him and Love was just not it for me as well.
It was extremely cringe. I mean in the first episode he gives off the complete douche California kid wants to bang hot moms vibes and it really made him irredeemable in my eyes. And every interaction from then on could be reduced to, "he just wants to get laid by this married woman". He reminds me of some unscrupulous people I've met before (particularly in the looks department).
!RemindMe 14 months
Always question it when you don’t see the body 😅
[removed]
S1 was definitely the best. Impacted me the most.
I agree with everything you’ve said here.

I also never liked Love. I’m also not upset over the ending and am actually quite pleased with it, despite not liking much of the season. She was doing way too much and was so annoying. 

S1 is by far still the best.
I agree 100% and it seems like most people don’t feel this way so it’s nice to know I’m not alone. Very interested to see what they do with Season 4.
Same I rewatched Season 1 and through S2 before watching S3. I remember thinking I didn’t like Love at all the entire S2…I missed Beck. I am surprised how many people were mean about Beck when she was sweet. I also love the lighting of this show but especially S1 & S2.
He was 19 and she’s in her mid twenties
It was gross, but he was in college. I don’t know why he kept being referred to as a teenager.
He was in college and legal, but it's SUPER weird they all call him 'kid.'
especially when Dante had expressed how him and his partner had been trying to adopt for 3 years. I found that was sweet of Joe to consider them.
Would he have kept the child had it been a girl though?
wtf
[removed]
Interesting and perfect. Natalie actually was seducing him and was 100x more interesting. They wrote Marienne sloppily and the actress is bad and doesn't have any charisma or chemistry. I'd have like to see two psychos to work this out and have another issue.
They are both horrible, manipulative murderers but lol they deserve each other. They both need therapy though.
It's frustrating because he will NEVER find what he's looking for with anyone BUT Love.
There is no ONE for Joe. That's literally the point. He doesn't love Love or any of this women and never will. He's a fucking sociopath.
I disagree. She was guarded, and then let her guard down a little once she found out that Joe had a hard childhood similar to hers. That’s the first thing that made her interesting to him.  She had a her love for art and children’s illustrations and her problems with drugs and her abusive ex which was what Joe wanted to come save her from. She had a pretty normal life, yes, but I don’t get how that makes her a flat character. She’s a woman who’s had to deal with problems and is trying to rebuild her life and be there for her daughter.
I hate that he suddenly stopped feeling anything for Love and we got family drama. Candace Beck Love all strong women. Pretty but with flaws and distinct personality. Heck I believe Natalie would be as well. She was pretty seductive so way more interesting. Basically Marienne plot ruined the show the most.
Yes !!!! Why was Marienne so so boring. There was no tension between the two whatsoever and her character of being such a good person wasn’t even consistent if she’s happily sleeping with a married man.
Definitely understand feeling bad for Henry, but, he is much better off being raised by a loving couple then being raised by one or two serial killers.
It was because he was supposed to “keep his eyes on his partner” and when he wasn’t looking at her and was closing his eyes, she knew he was fantasizing/obsessed with someone.
They both gaslit the hell out of each other this season - it's not just a Love thing.
She is dead, if they didn't find her body then the case wouldn't have been closed.
If this never does I’m going to be annoyed! At least at the end of season 2 people were starting to clock onto his previous crimes. No reference at all in this season
I assumed he picked up being Will Bedelheim again.
Where did he get to money to buy a new ID from will and how would he get it if will is in the Philippines
Also he changed his name in season 2 to avoid all the trouble in New York and just changed back??
Fake passport I guess he can fake antique books and has been shown to have high level IT skills before so doesn’t seem that much of stretch to me he could fake a passport
EXACTLY!
His name is Nick in Paris so maybe that’s the ID he he used to leave the country
it's like everything is paced too fast yet so slow and unconnected at the same time
what interview? could you link it?
Yes! Perfectly said
episode 6,7, 8 was dragging. i had no interest in loves mom and her own personal stuff
Yeah she sucked as a character, same with the high school kid
I agree! I wish they had killed her off in a less finite way so she could come back as a twist. Probably too much like the Candace plot though... Really gonna miss Love. :(
Same Love and Joe just works, I don't care that they don't get along, they still just work and are perfect for each other in the end of the day.
I was confused every other episode on whether he is his stepson or his son; especially when he talked about him with Love and when he got kicked out. I know it was stated specifically very early on but to me (especially since it wasn't expanded upon like you pointed out; and sure maybe he grew up with him but if his bio dad is alive wouldn't that be the relationship worth working on more, especially with all the shit with Natalie going on and Matthew constantly rejecting him) it (repeatedly) almost seemed like the writers didn't know/couldn't make their minds up on the...nature of their relationship at the very least, if that makes sense. It all felt very weird.
I think because if Theo had lost his actual mother he would have been too depressed and distracted to fuck Love. By making her his 'stepmom' they could justify him not giving a shit she's gone.
Exactly. What are they going to do go in a circle? Joe gets obsessed with someone and inevitably kills them? They can't create another love.
She doesn’t appear at all
Breathes too heavy please, you're so right
>So if he didn't casually run across Cary's fun bag, he would've been toast?

I cannot stress enough how ridiculous this one seems in retrospect!! And knowing him and how he was all about Marianne, the answer would definitely be yes. He'd have no time to run to the store granted he googled wolfsbane before the swinging night, duh, lol

&#x200B;

>Kinda got whiplash from how fast Marianne reciprocated his feelings.

And that too...smh. I mean, sure, she was smitten with him, that much I'll give the writers, it wasn't too far fetched that she had some sort of...greater than physical attraction to him but when she said the ily back over the phone I just rolled my eyes...totally out of character (even if at a tumultous time with the trial and all; Joe otoh saying that was no surprise)
That would be fucking wild
Unless they changed his name for whatever reason, he isn’t. Joe’s mom called the kid “Jacob.”
Omg imagine!
wait, brother of what?
!RemindMe 14 months
In a future season for sure.
Nah you need a warrant
I agree.  Love was a ride or dieeeee kinda girl.  Who could be more perfect for Joe?  I don’t understand why he fell out of love with her.  The hypocrisy is so frustrating.
Agreed, and that's what I thought would happen.  It would have been poetic, really.  The last minute thing with him at the end felt rushed and kind of like a cop out to squeeze another season.  But idk, I was watching while doing other stuff so maybe I just missed the build up, but it felt out of left field imo.
I agree with this “unpopular opinion”
I literally do not understand how anyone can sympathize with him ever.
I wonder if they amped it up because too many people were crushing out on Joe & being like, "Beck didn't DESERVE him!" Like, ladies, settle down, he's a fucking serial killer.
Marieanne was given such a short stick. She was given the speedrun version compared to his last two major  relationships where the time and major focus was given to Joe wanting, stalking and then pursuing the woman. 

This season she was introduced as the 'You' much later into the season, had no real connection to the overall plot and was given much less time than Bek and Love as an actual character. I'm glad she has custody of her daughter but that and she draws, likes books and had a past addiction problem is all I know of her.
After Love Quinn, the chasing girls bit is getting old. Him chasing after another girl is boring now, even if it is in Paris. 🙄 Maybe Paco or Ellie will make a reappearance?
Totally! Made me really wonder where they are taking Joe's story in season 4. Him stalking another girl in the next season is something I doubt I'll watch.
I agree with this completely.
I hate Marienne and I don't care what happen to her. Easily the worst part of the show.
I feel cheated on. Also Natalie seemed more interesting than Marianne. Also it became a parody.
he pieced it together from what the mom told him
He got suspicious when he saw the plant and googled it. He didn’t know what was going to happen in that exact moment, he had just prepared himself for the worst knowing the possibility.
They didnt show her exactly dying right. She was pafalyzed when blast happened?
Seriously. We just skip no scenes with Marianne and Joe because it got so fucking boring.
sherry and cary\*
Joe caused love to go crazy because Joe wasn't there for her. It all goes back to Joe.
I don't think there is any getting better for Joe. He is a serial killer. 

Love fucked some stuff up, but whether she was a murderer or not, he was always going to find a new obsession and always going to keep killing.
Maybe she made it out alive like Candace 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
Omg same
He kept going back and forth with him feeling like he has a savior complex with women and that hes reminded of his mom thru her. Perhaps it’s not convincing because he doesn’t actually like her, he’s trying to create a twisted reality with him mother/counselor when he was young. I’m not convinced that it’s “love” for her either
That is his entire thing though. He sees a woman once and becomes obsessed with her. Its more about his fantasies than anything to do with the real woman.
Marienne was a completley unnecessary insert, they could have made Joe wanting to get away from Love by virtue of wanting to protect Henry. Every scene with Joe and Marienne felt so forced and unecessary.
Umm what does “the characters gave me whiplash” mean?
preach
This was exactly what I was hoping for as well. But the show failed us with its predictable Plot and need to keep Joe as the main character of this show. I’m assuming due to the viewers being more in love with Joes insufferable ass than in love with a good storyline and plot twist. His entire backstory was that of a stereotypical serial killer and I found it less interesting due to its common theme. I’m not going to be watching season 4. It seems it’ll be a bit boring I suppose.
What! 😱
Not surprising. He looked older than 19.
As much as I didn't want Love to die, no way I would want a season without Joe, he is the main character for a reason, the popularity of you would drop tremendously if Love was going to star the 4th season. 

We were starting to reach the ridiculous realm when it comes to killing people because of Love, Joe literally killed one character this season, I think she is just not interesting enough to carry the whole season by her self and we all would miss the Joe internal dialogue as well, that is what makes You unique.

I do agree with you that I'm happy some persons survive in the end or it would just be like every other ending of you.

Yeah, I think season 4 should be the final and I heard they are almost caught up with the source material.
I’m listening to exile right now 
I THINK IVE SEEN THIS FILM BEFORE
Mhmmm I don’t think so love killed a guy even after he apologized for getting her infected with MRSA, his character was actually a good wholehearted person.
He was running on zero sleep and a cranked out mind.
Tbf sometimes you can be so engrossed in things that you need a fresh set of eyes
Who would go and tell? I think the only witnesses were Carry and Sherry and in the end the "suicide note" addressed how everything went down due to Love. Technically they were both >!dead!< so there was no point in telling the police afterwards.
Beginning of season: Maybe this time joe will really find his match and be a good person 

End of season: Come on joe, pick up the bat and smash that mf
Both were trying to run for life, with Sherry probably failed and got cornered. 

Regarding the size difference, if you think about it, murderers are capable to use most things normal people see around them as weapons. The reason Cary couldn't kill Joe is simply because Cary is not a killer - "he doesn't have it".
Scared maybe? They weren’t used to any of this stuff
I kinda felt this way about season 2 as well tbh. The show runners know how to write the beginning and endings but the middles are a slog for me
This is how I felt.

Loved 1-2. 

3-6 were a slog
7- wasn’t the best, but I thought there was some interesting character work and seeds planted
8- was a lot like 7, until the end kicked things into gear
9-10: loved them
That would have been amazing. Have the narration in her voice. And then somewhere around episode or 5, all of a sudden it’s joes voice narrating again. He found her.
They got vaccinated.










/s
When he revealed that he had taken adrenaline right before and they explained that wolfsbane stops the heart and adrenaline gets it going I was like that is not how any of this works 😖
The idea is that the adrenaline kept him alive long enough to regain his motor skills.
I actually liked what they were doing with Joe around halfway through the season with him realising that his engagements with romantic partners were so unhealthy in part due to childhood circumstances. But then they just thew that out the window and were like "nope he's just stalking another woman".
People don't like Beck but I do. Her plot was interesting she was flawed she had interesting friends - Peach and great chemistry. I liked how Joe learned about the social media and unmasked a lot. She tried to write and she seems like a millennial. Realistic. Then it went downhill and now it was awful.
I was hoping that Natalie was a setup by Love designed to trap Joe & weaponize his obsessive killer instincts in Loves favour. That would've made for a really interesting setup for next season.
THE CONTRAST
Victoria is the best actor in the entire series in my opinion
30 more minutes! I am so so excited
Cary-sexual king
Is that a book spoiler? Because that is the only reason why you have it in spoiler correct? Haven't read it btw.
The pill took 45 minutes to kick in according to the bottle.
He was paralyzed, the adrenaline just made it wear off faster
My favorite season and I m still haunted and emotionally depressed. My heart rate was just high for the entire season and love dying or not just pushed it man. I can’t believe what a masterpiece this season was. Best season.
> The best show I have ever seen

LOL
I do somewhat agree with this. I was trying to work out how many people Joe has now killed and actually couldn’t. Its a little bit annoying that this almost entirely ignored the last seasons… at the end of the last season people were cottoning on to him yet he changed his name back to joe and still wasn’t being investigated at ALL for being a serial killer killing multiple people?
Unfortunately all you need is evidence in the court of law and his fingerprints were on the weapon
You perfectly put into words what I was thinking, better than I ever could. Exactly this. Season 4 will just be dragging the show on too long.
Nah they are gonna switch cities every season for more viewers

Paris? French viewers. Madrid or Mexico City? Every Spanish speaking country. Italy? China? You got it.

Maybe when we get to Russia it will die
Some people sort by new
Felt bad for the kid and he wasn't in love with Love anymore so that jealous rage wasn't there.
Because theoretically nobody had to die in Season 3 had Joe been faithful. All Love wanted was that perfect utopian family with Joe and Henry. With James, she says she accidentally killed James. At that point why would she lie? We have no idea what the relationship between James and Love was like. James may have been just like Joe. Love could have killed Marianne. But she spared her because Love realized that Marianne wasn’t the problem, and she was also a mother. At the end of the day, there is no perfect “You” for Joe, but Love was damn near close.
Wow how did I not realize this!!! So cool
Yup. Filmed on the same backlot in LA
Yeah, I feel like a lot of people miss that. Love was right - there wasn’t anything she could do for Joe to love her. She was his match in every single way and it still wasn’t enough.
I thought Natalie checking out Gone Girl at the library was going to be foreshadowing for either Natalie framing Joe and Love then running off or Joe framing Natalie's husband in a GG way
lmao I am still around 15 min on 1st episode but this comment made me skip forward LMAO. WTH...
Yup! That was fucking amazing. 😂 I love Love so much bruh.
I can't believe that just happened lmao. Holy shit
Originally I thought Natalie was FBI but turns out she really was just a whore lol.
Yeah I was hoping they kept Love alive would be interesting for future Season since the role the actor played did a very good job. Would def make some good story plots.
Yes!

I’ve only seen like one role where he doesn’t play a scumbag lmfao
Present!
Theo had been there in real life and had seen the camera in person. Matthew had not.
I'm surprised they couldn't hack the baby monitor cams. Kinda thought that would've come into play
the answer is bad writing
I agree, I honestly want Season 4 to have all of Joe's sins eventually catch up to him, and get some detectives involved. Then have Season 5 be the finale, possibly revealing that Love is still alive and you could also have Theo and Ellie return to add to the investigation. I just really really don't want another chase.
They might bring it full circle in Season 4.
I hope they tie up the loose ends in Season 4, like bringing Ellie back or Joe finally going down for Peach's murder. Actually, remember Peach has a "Cousin Inez" in Paris? Considering that's where Season 4 is set, wouldn't it be interesting if the two of them cross paths...
I wanted him to die as soon as he was making moves on Love, I'm not sure if it's because I'm self inserting as Joe, but I was just freaking annoyed by him.

Funny enough I didn't feel anyway when that Librarian was making her move on Joe.

I guess I'm a hypocrite.
I had the same thought ... even in s2/3 I know Beck wasn't as famous but it's still wild to me that he can go on to live a normal life with the same name and essentially zero disguise.
We must be watching different shows, because the flashback kid in season 3 had dark brown eyes. (I will say I don’t remember who played the flashbacks in season 1 and 2).
Fully agreed. They should have made it Joe and love against everyone, a la Bonnie and Clyde. What a waste with marienne. Horrible writing.
Yes yes yes!! My friends say Love is the crazier one but I really beg to differ. Somehow I feel her desperation and can empathise with her way more than with Joe.

Ok granted both are murderers but my heart just breaks more for Love. I’m biased :p
Joe can’t fall in love, because he in love with idea of chasing love. His idea of love is unattainable
Exactly what I was thinking. First two seasons were great. There was no reason for him to leave love. I feel like if anything love should have killed him and the next season would be about her.
Fascinating take. I actually quite liked it, possibly more than season 2.
The murders were kinda bad too
Completely agree - I was hoping for more "despicable serial-killer couple struggle with marriage, parenthood and blending into suburban society" - I feel like there were so many possibilities with that and their weird delusional journey of justifying their terrible actions for the sake of their child. I was disappointed when Henry essentially disappeared from the show, and Joe decided he didn't want anything to do with Love and became obsessed with Marienne. We had that done really well in S1 & S2, so here it just felt a bit repetitive, but I get that that's the point of his character.  


Edit: Also yes I noticed the filters being a bit intense and distracting at times, I wonder what the creative decision behind that was - I interpret it as Joe & Love having intense 'tunnel vision' because they're so caught up in their lies and bad actions, and trying to be part of the normal world is challenging for them.
YES YES YES. THEM FIXING ON THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE SO GOOD
Yeah I very much didn’t like them making the girl the “crazy psycho” while making Joe the “good psycho.” Joe was way worse. He just completely did a 180 on Love the second Marianne paid an ounce of attention to him. It was pathetic and predictable. The only part of the story line that was extremely predictable
They really need to end the show next season, it’s getting ridiculous.
How was joe the problem? He didn’t kill anyone except Ryan. The amount of people Love tried to kill and killed
> There is a ton of suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this show  

Never understood why people need their TV shows to be as accurate as possible. It's entertainment. The point is to escape from reality. The most popular content these days is mostly make believe fantasy and superhero stuff and yet folks get fired up because a dramatized serial killer escapes the police. You said below that you generally like sci-fi content. So what do you want? Season 4 to be a full year court room drama where Joe and Love are acquitted because their high price attorney found an error in evidence collection?   

> I don't think I'm the target demographic for a show like this (30-year-old male, likes sci-fi and action) but the totality of what it offers - unique plot, humorous social commentary, funny one-liners in a voiceover, more - really makes for a fun ride.  

Co-lead is an extremely attractive woman who kills people and is constantly thinking about/having sex. You (and me) are definitely one of the key target demos.
Oof
Love said he's 19 so yeeeeah
I had such a hard time watching any of their interactions
> Love, maybe 35ish 

Excuse me?! Yeah no she’s probably like 30 at the absolute most, Victoria Pedretti is only 26 is real life for comparison
I looked it up, the actor who plays Theo is actually one year older than Victoria
I read something that said she was in her late 20’s  (26 I think?) I don’t know how reliable it was. still kinda… questionable though.
I thought Love was in her 20s. She doesn't look older than mid-20@.
>!Yeah they botched the end of Joe and Love entirely. It's almost like they wanted to reduce the amount of time Joe and Love discussed emotions with each other. They could have killed her in a graceful way that did justice to the connection/history she had with Joe. They didn't go into their relationship much at all. I even feel like Beck/Joe's relationship was far more real than the S3 Joe/Love!<
This whole show is just about a psychopath doing mental gymnastics to get his dick wet lol
She gaslights everyone. The woman is full on insane. Calls you a psycho while banging you over the head.
Yes, constantly. Having a conversation with her seems like it would be trying to avoid land mines. Joe was literally just sitting and reading a book and Love got mad and took the baby to her mother's and told him to enjoy the quiet? Wtf
Honestly, I think there's no point in trying to make sense of this show.
They revealed that he now goes by Nick, maybe he found some way to get fake documentation?
it's hilarious that they had a whole elaborate plot point in S2 about him not knowing how to change his identity, only to completely forget about it this season and have him just breeze through the process, to the point we don't even see anything relating to it. they just wholeass forgot will bettelheim
As a guy and a husband with a newborn it made me really jealous for Joe lol.
Perfect song for that ending too! When it started playing I was like yesss this goes too well!
Niggas in Paris
Yep! I know this was filmed before it, but it’s odd they acknowledged it and yet they are so far off from how it plays out in reality.
I found it sick. (In a bad way).
Wanna know too
8 toes left
He’s currently in Paris.
That would be interesting!
didnt love do this already? in a way?
The answer to your question was disclosed at the ending of 3x10 (season finale)
I’m the final narration, it’s said that Dottie tried everything legally to get custody of Henry, but didn’t succeed and that Dante and Lansing kept custody and raised him as their own.
Same
Yes.  I'm not a fan of the way things went down, to be honest.  I was rooting for her over him in the finale.
Omg same
The same as him except she doesn’t fall out of love and she’s impulsive. 

I think what really got to him was that he knew she was going to get him caught. Like… every week someone else appeared dead for dumb reasons.

Imagine if she didn’t die and Joe and him stay together. How the Fuck can you cover up the murder of those two in the basement? 

Matter of fact Theo dying was such an unexplainable and obvious thing? Like that was probably the dumbest murder (or attempted murder) this season. How do you cover that up?
Yeah by the end it was like… a rampage and the police never thought a thing

But they also live in a very superficial place so I bet when shit like that happens the neighbor just gossip and they don’t do anything
Definitely agree. Legitimately had to take a break for a few days in the middle lmao.
See this is one this the book does better than the show. In the book Joe doesn’t kill one single person. People die… but Joe doesn’t kill them. He just manipulates the shit out of them playing these really f’ed up mind games with all of them.
Yeah I don’t think that she is, I feel like she had enough time to get out with minimal injury.
He injected all that wolfsbane into her, so I think she is dead.. but I do really hope somehow she is not
Maybe she had a twin the whole time that her parents gave up for adoption?
I feel like the show needs to end with this next season or it will start to jump the ship. The cops needs to start getting involved. Joe gets away with everything so perfectly its getting ridiculous.
I would love to know what the therapist thought after seeing the news articles come out about them, in light of that particular comment. Missed opportunity for a drive by clip if you ask me
The baby cries or whimpers, that’s when Dante looks down.
He did not even look at the baby, he probably noticed it when it started making noise.
spoilers: agreed. love was written throughout the whole season to rival joe in being the most crazy of the two. i already thought it was over the top when love had succeeded in paralyzing joe. but as it turns out, he had already ingested an anecdote? he literally is "too perfect" like you said. at that point it had just become annoying
same, im glad. She was fked in the head. Redditors are blind to the fact everyone in the show that died was bc of her.
Same here. It was in self-defense and she's also a fucking lunatic.
You are a bit naiive. They are both disgusting and horrible, they are sadly good for each other.
That’s what I was thinking!! I would have been shocked, and then a fourth season led by Love
I really wanted/lowkey rooted for >!Love to kill Joe!< At some point, he has to >!die!<  and I thought she was the only person to be able to make it happen. That was of course until they released a season 4 announcement just days before season 3 came out lol
I think eventually the show will end in a future season and have Joe be killed off somehow.
i legit think that was the only way they could save the show. we're just getting another season of joe doing the same fucking stuff and its gonna suck
He arguably ruined his own child’s life. Ofc when Henry grows up he’s going to have to deal with learning he’s adopted. If he learns who his parents are, he’ll have to deal with the trauma of knowing they were murderers.
I doubt it, they already brought in Mary Kay (aka Marienne) and >!killed off Love!<, and the other stuff in book 3 was similar to the things he's done in other seasons.
Doubt, I don't think the author will have it published in time. Netflix would want to get it out as soon as possible imo
Her sister is the one who called the police to report her missing. Matthew didn’t which made him look bad
Yeah I kept saying “She’s the crazy one and keeps killing people!” but the truth is they both were bonkers.
I mean, it's kind of a minor detail that you have to forgive because only a fraction of the viewers are even going to know. Being a musician, most of the time, I notice that the character isn't playing actual notes or chords (what you're hearing is not what they're playing), but I can forgive it because its a show.
Yes. It was so overdone that it became meaningless.
Who is Emily?
Agreed about therapy! I would have liked it all the way through. Perhaps they take a week off and are back to realize they aren’t “over” their issues and still have to work through them.
Seriously loved that. Wearing a baseball cap doesn't hide your face.
Interesting I think the characters in season 2 were far interesting than season 1, especially the two sisters.
They were hysterical in the cage!! “I am a feminist… who GRAZED YOU”
Y ah I actually like them in the end too.
did you not see the part where Matt said he doesn't care what happens to joe? He didn't call the cops cause he wanted joe to die.
joe's dead but Nick isn't
Exactly
Fake ID/documentation.
It’s because love is damaged and she has a tendency to fix broken things unfortunately like how Joe is obsessed to white knight.

Plus her feeling alienated from Joe bit by bit and her self destructive tendencies pushed her to find an outlet.
Good one
Nah, she was literally a mess. Killed so many people impulsively.. there’s no real strategy to her other than jealousy. Joe is the main character and his obsessions and chess play on outsmarting people and capturing them makes me like the show. Not gonna lie .. the whole sex stuff really bothered me. It was just a lot of intimacy issue stuff and not enough plotting and scheming
It’s the baby monitor not normal security cameras. So I assumed he didn’t know about it
Yes, referring to Season 1 when he hides under Peach’s bed and she ends up having sex and using toys and he listens to the whole thing.
Beck’s friend Peach pegged a guy while joe was hiding under the bed
It's already ordered.
Didn’t Will make him a new passport in season 2?
I mean the entire finale is extremely far fetched and takes one to stretch the imagination. I thought it was almost too much and everything up to ep10 was really fun, but if I had any critique of the show it would be that in the end they tried to do too much.
Completely agree that a lot of the stuff they were getting away with was over the top at points. Like when Joe killed Ryan not only would there have been cameras to follow his movements but there was literally a witness who saw him walk away from the body and not turn around when they called for help. Also when Natalie was killed/disappeared, would the police not have retraced her movements before she disappeared through cctv and seen that she was at the bakery with Love right before she disappeared?? It’s also a stretch to think people would buy the Natalie/Gil affair. Would the police not have noticed the last place Gil was seen was around the bakery too? As for the Conrad’s being in the cage for days, would there not have been an alarm raised then they didn’t show up? Like what were their kids doing the whole time they were locked away? I know it’s a show and it’s all for dramatic effect, but you wouldn’t even dream of getting away with any of the shit they pulled off in real life lol
and i thought it was just my tv lol
In joes cover up I guess Love could’ve done it?
I think the letter outlined that he knew he was about to be killed and he wanted to make sure his son was safe from Love. And Love’s family. It was played as a last ditch effort to save his son.
Fr in the first two seasons I was rooting for him but this season I just didn’t like him whatsoever.
They've already confirmed there will be a 4th season (it also says it post credits). I would love one more season where we see everything unravel for Joe
Maybe someone will pick up on the writing pattern of Love’s and Gil’s letters and point out that it’s the same person. Maybe even the remainder of Beck’s book will be taken into consideration.
Why are you watching then? Just don’t watch it
You’re right. It was especially weird that Joe didn’t get caught killing Marianne’s Ex when like 10 secs after he did it, a woman walked outta the building screaming about how the guy was dead
Maybe to show that he’s been groomed his whole life to feel drawn toward troubled women and to help them
Also Natalie hated Matthew but he apparently loved her? She literally didn't shut up about how her marriage was a cage.
No. The show is about Joe, and so Joe’s survival and ability to get away with shit are essential. There was no feasible way she could have been kept around as a side character in season 4 as she was too much of a liability to his freedom and survival.
I’m sad too. It’s been 3 days since I finished season 3 and it still makes me super sad when I think about it too.
The actor who played Theo is actually older than Pendretti.
Oh gosh I didn't even think about that. Definitely a plot hole
It was a baby monitor bro, not a real camera. Hope that clears up
I was just thinking about this earlier! Love tends to act on impulse and is quite emotional, so I don’t think her being a psychopath pans out. She definitely justifies her reasoning for killing and doesn’t show remorse for those she hurts but has extreme affection and love for those she’s close to. It’s always confused me. I think Joe is too emotional to be a classic psychopath too, as seen in his internal dialogues etc. and how hurt he was by betrayals from Candace and his other obsessions.
Oh my God so much.. I probably won't be watching season 4. 

Victoria is a gem I just wish show runners would stop murdering her characters... Dani, Nellie, Love...
[deleted]
Yeah he was great.  I wish they had a scene where Joe kills someone in front of Dante, or maybe drags a body through the room while carrying on a conversation with him.
lol yeah i’ve been just going through this sub looking for theo comments. he was just whiney as hell for some poon
I didn't mind him but when he did that little "what a creep" thing to himself when he saw Joe in the window? That was really forced acting IMO
Yessssss.. he drove my partner and I bonkers, we were rolling our eyes in every scene he was in.. I actually really liked his dad though!
Omg, yes I hated Theo too. The actor played this same needy boyfriend role in another movie and it annoyed the hell out of me. I didn’t really understand his and love’s relationship because they didn’t have chemistry. That tied with his constant pushing himself onto her was very off putting. I did not understand why she entertained him. at all.
…yes
Yeah, even I was confused about that part… I mean what exactly was the plot behind that?
The scene where he eats the cupcake “seductively” is the biggest cringe I’ve seen in awhile
>!I think you missed the part where he has a flashback and realizes that the kid is better off without him since he would likely hurt the child and when he grows up being raised by a single dad psychopath he would be fucked up.!<

>!Remember when he talked to his mom. Same thing. Except he gave the child to a nice gay couple. Meaning he would grow up loved and normal and not in the system.!<
While Love somehow surviving and then continue to stalk and follow Joe would be cool, I can understand why the writers would want to be done with her/her story with Joe.

As for Joe getting to France, in Season 2 it shows he was still friend with Will Bedelheim(sp) so it's possibly he got him to help get another new identity.
I think the show should have swapped places with protagonists. Because then it would be ‘new’ and more to work with. Since Love has a lot more money she could probably be able to do all sorts of shit
Joe is different in the book yet not. One dumb thing that says the same is him just completely falling out of love with Love like she never even existed. 

In the book it’s sort of explained as bc he doesn’t like who he was with Love and preferred the new person he became with his née live interest. But that makes more sense in the book bc the storyline with love interest in completely different.
>!Yeah tbh I am not usually a fan of “woman wins and the show is about her” because usually it seems forced. But THIS ONE, this was the perfect and interesting play. Because she’s not like Joe psycho, she is more rounded in the sense that she is more compulsive and much more adaptable to her surroundings (acting normal).!<
I think - as far as they're concerned - Joe dropped him off acknowledging his own fate.
That's actually an excellent spot - that must be part of the reason why Love spared Marienne. Juliette represents the daughter she didn't have.
I'm binging the whole series rn and there's parts I love but there's also parts I feel like people let the show get away with too much.

In S2 I didn't like how love killed Delilah, I heard in the book it's actually Joe who does it and I feel that would've been more believable *at the time*.

Now in S3 my biggest gripe is the lack of self-control these two have, especially Love.

Love just can't stop killing people jc. The rate she's killing I wouldn't be surprised at this point if she's killed many times in between 40's babysitter and Delilah. But that's not implied at all. 

Which is why I didn't like her killing Delilah bc her character didn't imply her to be a *serial* killer type at all, even out of passion. She killed, *1 person*? A long time ago? Then kills 2 right then and there with many more to come?

S2 was my favorite up until towards the end. The characters were all just very interesting. 40, Delilah, Ellie, and Henderson we're all very interesting characters. I don't like *how* forty died. I don't like that *Love* killed Delilah. Started mucking up the believability for me.

I like the current season, just Love making me really mad. Also the fake ass friend taking advantage of a tragedy for clout. As well as the overly politically correct gluten vegan keto moral high ground plastic people as well, but ik that's the point.
Also… everyone knows typed suicide notes are bs. No ducking types their suicide note. You’d at least sign it or something to prove it was really you who wrote it. That’s like tv cop 101.
Someone said Joe and Love would have never worked because Joe doesn't want anyone like him. He wants a "good" woman so he can settle down and stop doing what he does. It kind of makes sense to me.
I have a theory it's because Love survived and is pregnant with their daughter. And that this storyline will make for her return in a later season. Here's why:

The writers spent a lot of time this season speculating that Love was/would become pregnant:  
\- for a long run after she got it on with Theo  
\- right before the roast chicken shenanigans went down

The writers made a huge point about them being excited to have a girl:  
\- when Love felt she was pregnant with a girl (end of season 2)  
\- when Henry turned out to be a boy and Joe was hella disappointed (beginning of season 3)  
\- Love looking up girls' names (end of season 3)

It's the "Chekhov's gun" of this season. Why make such a big deal about it if it doesn't have any significance.

It also makes for a potential "coming back from the dead"-story for Love which would be much different to Candace's story. Because Joe wanted a daughter so bad, he would have a huge interest in being in her life (bringing Love back in the loop).
He was worried a son would be destined to turn out like him
No, you are definitely not the only one. I low key couldn’t stand her, and I can’t really articulate why.
Cary and Sherry have one of the best redemption arcs I've ever seen.
Hi, I’m late! Maybe the problem *was* that he was up day and night and reviewing footage so much it slipped past him? He was constantly sleep deprived.
I don't think he reviewed the footage past when his wifes car left because why would he? His wife entered then left with her car. Why would you watch the footage past that point?
Agreed.  Marianne was boring AF.
Thats not what happened. He wrote in the suicide post as love saying she killed her husband. The toes were to prove that love killed her husband and that she must have gotten rid of the body. He put the toe in the pie to have a reason why she would have kept the toes.
Love was definitely annoying
I hated Love too. She was so annoying. Season 1, I loved Ethan, Blythe, and Karin Minty. I also loved Beck although I know a lot of people didn't like her. I was just missing her the whole time during season 2 while Love was on. I really liked Forty too. I found Love uninteresting other than her hidden psycho side she shared with Joe. Nothing else about her intrigued me though. I was so annoyed when she killed Delilah.
Exactly. Not to mention that once love tried to kill him, there would be no salvaging their relationship. Maybe the dynamic could’ve been played up a little bit for another season but I think it would’ve just been boring knowing that they’re fully capable of killing each other at any moment. The plot twist at the end of love actually trying to kill him sealed the nail in her coffin. And tbh i was happy by the time she died i was sick of her killing or trying to kill a bunch of randos.
Yeah her falling for Theo didn’t seem like “her” to me. She seemed fiercely loyal before. And he wasn’t even her type.
If I’m remember correctly when Marianne is about to go to court Dante is testing her and he mentions having experience with this during the adoption process
i also found the timing/cadence of the marienne obsession really strange. I chalked it up to him managing to suppress the obsession for the sake of his family, but her reciprocation felt kind of unbelievable to me. especially when you add the layer of her trying to get custody of her daughter back
I think Penn just signed on for season 4-6
how ?
Me too! And she was hooking up with a 19yr old - like no, weirdo.
Yes! I agree. I’m already excited for season 4.
Season 2 was a rehash of Season 1 but it did everything so much better. From the side characters being far more interesting and fleshed out, to the development with Joe, etc. Even the setting was better, since it was the exact opposite of everything Joe is about that it made both that much more entertaining.
Have you finished the season yet?
I was surprised too! I really thought they were going to further the story with sophistication. Maybe though it’s to show just how sick joe is. And that he’s never going to change because he doesn’t WANT to.
Huh prudence is fire in Sabrina and she is very good in this one as well
I do! I plan to re-watch season one and two to cleanse my pallet and rid myself of the bad taste of season three!
I really thought she was going to stick around since they are both killers. At least he listened to her and dropped Henry off to some halfway decent people. I agree, I’m not going to get into another girls backstory just to have Joe make Googly eyes with her and kill her 7 episodes later.
Just takes some time to kick in
there was a shot when Marienne was over where he was starting to move/lift one of his fingers, so I think that was supposed to indicate the antidote was kicking in
he was, but by season's end all is revealed. Love studied him, and knew the truth.
thought it was college too, he mentions a dean. thought they did mention he was 19? Coulda sworn i heard his age.
I think the friend, Sherry said he was 19 at some point when Love told her they had slept together.
He's gonna be ok!
all theatrics..he really didn't have to, but he framed it in a way that cops wouldn't look for his body
yep there's one in season 3
> He just wants to be a good person and have a normal life

No, he does not. Even if he has the perfect life, he will find a way to screw it up and keep killing people out of "love", because that's who he is. He's an obssessive serial murderer. He will always find another woman to idolize, find out they ain't perfect, lose interest or the women themselves figure out who he is, Joe kills them and goes on to another.

Joe is NOT a good person and never will be
Yes thank you! I am baffled by the love well for love. Well this season sucked joe story was redundant as always. But love just really fucked everything up
She took care of him when he was sick and he wanted to leave her when he got better so she poisoned him and killed him.
At one point in the final episode she alluding to him possibly getting better, but I always figured (and thought his mum suggested) the illness was terminal and he was going to definitely pass from it.
He sent the message as an email to the HOA
I sort of agree. I liked the ending overall but it felt very rushed. I would’ve liked to have seen more about both of their plans. Everything seemed to come together within 10 minutes
[deleted]
Love attempted to kill Theo and Joe saved Theo so the email to him should make perfect sense.
I wanted to hate them but they were funny as hell.
I think there are multiple reasons for her character being different, the biggest one being that she's still grieving the death of her brother, and losing someone so close to you can really alter your state of being for some as it clearly did for Love.

I think the other reason is that this is actually the real her but for most of last season (from what I can remember) we were seeing the front she put on or the persona that Joe wanted her to have, until the end.

Also, as the other commenter said, the change in personality seemed to also come from being tired of trying to fit in.

So imo it's not really a complete turnaround. Personally, it seemed they were always building towards this.
I replayed that scene multiple times! I was at the edge of my seat too. I wrote on my comment that my favorite part of this season was the Conrads and their dynamics and Sherry's acting absolutely cracked me up. 

That scene was so well acted and suspenseful and was probably the highlight of the entire season. 

I just finished watching the season, and after sitting on my thoughts, it did feel like a different series from what I remember about it. It felt more like a drama/suspense/slice of life/marriage and infidelity versus the thriller aspect of the previous seasons. 

Plus, I thought the plot was pretty weak as well. They should have focused on one story line, but I felt for this season we had a lot of tiny moving parts that weren't fleshed out but still drove the plot along. So it felt a bit strange and glued together.
[deleted]
Because honestly, Joe has truly met his match when it comes to Love in the regards to killing. Love was a little off her game this season in regards to covering up her crimes (I blame the postpartum) but overall she is very cunning and more ruthless then Joe could ever be. Love coming at Joe with a full vengeance & Joe fighting for his life to kill her would definitely be good good TV
but love was about to kill him in the end
I was rooting for them (Joe & love) tbh😩
Very unlikely. They didnt bring beck back. It depends on what story they wanna tell. They already bought candice back. So it will be like repeating another same story
Also shes so selfish ;-;  She cheated on her husband with a teenager but still kept saying she was the only one putting in effort in the marriage lol
I loved her as a character, the actress is just phenomenal. Her character got on my nerves many times, and the fact that she managed to make the audience dislike her with her acting just shows how amazing of an actress she is!
Agree. All these "wish Love killed Joe and became the main character" responses are weird. You is Joe and Joe is You. Lol.
Agreed, this season was boring and it’s starting to feel like they’re dragging out the show.
He was paralysed. Takes time for the adrenaline to kick in.
just came across [this website](https://www.tunefind.com/show/you/season-3) that lists all the songs by episode and in order of when they played in the episode!
Could Theo have had a key?
Just date someone with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), you’ll realize it’s a nightmare despite the highs. 

Source: Dated a BPD and I saw a lot of her in Love
Same.
thought that song choice was brilliant but im also a sucker for bon iver
>believing the shirt had new blood on it was just unrealistic 

Month-old blood is very different than same-day blood?
Honestly couldn’t agree more. Not sure how they can top Joe being with another serial killer?? Anyone else is just going to be a repeat of season 1
I think what this season showed is sometimes you think you want someone or something so badly because their perfect or you have a lot in common but some people can’t handle when a mirror is in front of them, it reminds them too much of the things that they hate about themselves
Maybe Love will show up mid-season 4.
That's exactly why I don't like it as much as the first two. It felt like the writers were playing it safe by sticking to the tried and tested formula, instead of taking the plot to a different direction.
I mean it’s kind of accurate that sociopaths don’t put their children first and are self involved parents.
Re Point #3 - I actually find Joe way more psychotic than Love. Love does things on impulse and has serious anger management issues (which I feel boils down to toxic jealousy spiralling way out of control…) whereas Joe is just… a narcissist born to be a psychopath.

He killed Love so readily cos he perceived Love was getting in his way of “true love” (???), and then just moved on with life as usual. 

While he does show signs of humanity in s3 (eg his protection towards Henry), he is still the same old narcissist who fantasizes abt his subjects and discards them the moment they are not deemed “perfect” in his eyes :(
> I didn’t get the toe in the pie significance or what the point of that was.

It was love’s way of saying pie toe joe
alas t i did love t.  lots to sayeth, but i hadst a valorous time and shall leaveth t at yond!

I actually love joes monologues
Same! Me and my Girlfriend were ready to tear up during that scene. After all they been through and the long story of Joe and Love together since Season 2. Just to end like that.
I think it adds to the psychotic control freak Love is. Like she’s trying to seem perfect and put together.
the adrenaline or w/e takes 45 minutes to take effect according to the label, so he must have taken it right before they began eating.
They took serious liberties with that whole scene.
I read an article about the poison after I watched this and looked it up as well.
It causes RESPIRATORY paralysis not physical paralysis. It is highly dangerous. There isn't a way to really safely use it because there is no way to determine the amount of toxins from plant to plant. 
It can easily kill you just by handling it.
And adrenaline is not an antidote. 
At least not in the information I read. 
Strangest is it is supposedly only white and yellow ?
Love's plants were blue/purple.
I think to try and prove that he was dead it was kind of dumb tbh I think there’s so many issues with this series joe should have been caught thousands of times haha
I loved them, they made me hate joe and love so much I was begging for them to be caught!!!
I think Dottie took care of it at the end of season 2 since she did the same thing when Love killed the baby sitter and framed Forty when they were younger. But no, they never explain how. Probably $$$.
Fake passport? 

He is going by Nick now
YES YES. I bet she isn’t dead
He was wearing 🧤
That’s the entire point
[removed]
This is an excellent question! Was he using Will Betelheim as his ID?
Love was the last person known to be with Natalie before she disappeared so he fixated on her and got lucky
Nope, just you
If she survived, she'd be dressed in bandages like a mummy.
My answers

1. His friend Will may have given him another identity/passport.
2. Cops in TV shows are stupid if it's not a cop show. Shrugs.
3. $$$ can get anything done
4. Love saw Forty in him.
Hey here is my take on your questions.

1. I think he just used the passport will gave him and flew out of a smaller airport and maybe when to a couple of different cities first.
2. I think the cops are dumb and lazy. It was easier to believe the story that was given to them. 
3. I think ending to place months later because of how much older Henery looked and Joe said that there was a legal battle. Also that Carey and Shery wrote a book. 
4. I think love was never truly into Theo she felt undesirable because of Joe and Theo was very persistent in wanting her and making her feel needed too. I also agree with cheyennetology that she saw Forty in him.
1. Chartered a boat out of the country or something 
2. That one is weird. Also how did the guy who knows where all of the cameras are miss the one camera in the ally that shows who killed his wife? 
3. Thats an easy one to just overlook 
4. This was explained a little. She had a very close relationship with 40 her brother in the last season. Theo reminded her of 40 and she was using him to replace that hole in her life.
She used an oven mit. I remember because I was like "This show is so unrealistic.  Who uses an oven mit to use a knife?" And then I figured out why she did.
She only touched it with gloves!
I don't know, I find Love pretty dislikeable, no empathy, needlessly killing and selfish.
Amen
Oh and how does Love pay for the Bakery if her mum isn't helping?
He thought about getting rid of forty because he was too dependent on her, of maybe was leading to that, all season 2 had him trying to not kill anybody so he could deserve to be be with "love" he was trying not to repeat the mistakes of season 1, so much he was willing to leave and go on the run instead of killing Delilah, now was never had a chance to see this, he could have changed his mind last minute and attempted to kill her, well never know. I did understand why he didn't want to kill her 1. his delusional fantasy of trying to change and be better for "love" 2. he liked Delilah as a friend and new she had a little sister who depended on her.
For 1. I thought it was because she had >!poisoned the knife and needed to give him a few minutes alone to guarantee he would grab it. She needed him to stay at the table with a perfect opportunity. !<
Season 4…
Maybe we'll get that ending for a series finale. I agree, I enjoy his pattern of how he "pursues" his romantic interests.
I felt the same way about Love. Other than their shared hobby of homicide, I never really understood their connection. With Beck, I understood it was their shared love for books and lit. The same with Marienne as well as their shared experiences growing up in foster care. But with Love, I never got the draw. Even their first meeting at Anavrin with the peaches-- it just felt awkward and forced. Love just wasn't very interesting to me, and their courtship never seemed to have a "sweet" period the way Joe's and Beck's did.. She baked--okay, and that seemed to be the only semi-interesting thing about her. Okay, aside from the fact that she is a crazy psycho.. And she had a messed up childhood. But seems like all the women Joe's been drawn to had that. Honestly, I am glad Love's character is gone. 

I really enjoyed season 3 more than season 2. I feel like in season 2, I was just missing Beck and the bookstore the whole time. The cast of side characters in season 3 really made this work. Cary and Sherry were great comic relief. And I loved Marienne and was glad she didn't get ensnared in Joe's obsessive web too deeply.
Oh no a show about a serial killer who magically gets away with everything isn’t totally realistic 😳
Yeah, agreed. I just binged seasons 2 & 3 back to back and despite what she did, I couldn't want her to die. I think it's Victoria's incredible performance honestly. I suspect season 4 will feel hollow without her there.

I'm not a huge fan of the scenes with visions, but I hope she's able to return in that way.
yes, but 90% of reddit is hard simping for her. smh weird
No just Joe.
>My ranking would be:  S2 > S1 > S3, but I preferred the s3 ending to s1. Also, usually this show's last few episodes are the best, but I think s3 had a stronger start and then was kind of middling.

I really agree with this part, same season rankings. >!The polyamory plot was pointless besides putting Joe in a cringey situation,!< so IMO it should have been condensed to 10 minutes in one episode like the massage scene in S2.
Yeah Joe is more a sociopath and was made to be the way he is, where Love is more psychopathic, just never really having empathy to begin with. This was kind of shown when she was scared they were going to be caught and Joe was confident in his body hiding abilities whereas Love always had family money to be able to cover up her sloppy jobs.
Totally agree on the audience needing to be let in on Love's internal narrative more. That's what has always set You apart from other shows about serial killers/murders for me is the dark humor and hypocrisy that arises from the juxtaposition of the horrible acts being committed and the way the perpetrator is justifying it to themselves. I could have used more internal monologue from both Joe and Love and wish they went in and out of both throughout the season.
Agreed
Yes. Was the point to leave it open for another season? why was Dr.Nicky not involved? It turned into an 80s like horror movie. I think the best ending would be to have Dr.Nicky get revenge. Or at least pin together everything Joe did. So the world knows, but assumes Joe’s dead. 

So Joe is presumed 100% innocent and dead?  

If Love cared so much for her baby, I don’t think she would have just murdered the neighbor. Then the anti vaxx friend? I think a better storyline would have been, Henry died bc of the antivaxx neighbor. Then Love goes and kills him.
Wait…are you saying you’ve never heard it called “the measles”? You’ve only heard it called “measles” and that’s it?
It would take 2 more seasons of emily in paris for her to get convinced she is actually in love. She is always confused lol
and both shows ended in the protagonist faking their death
I agree, up until she talked to Marienne and didn't kill her. She showed some growth there. Instead of "saving her marriage" by ending another one of Joe's obsessions lives, she said that Marienne made single motherhood look noble or something like that and decided to kill Joe instead. I wish she would have and then we could have seen her being a single mom and dealing with her issues.
the show makes fun of woke people ffs , I can't believe you didn't pick that up.All the 'woke' characters in the show are either terrible ppl or dumbasses - including Joe and Love , like the entire neighbourhood claims to be 'feminist' but they all promote gender stereotypes (Sherry's husband) and sexist 'mommy culture' , don't forget the liberal anti vaxxer lol.
I’m not saying I disagree because I don’t, Joe got the woman he deserved with Love. But Love was just as much if not more of a psycho than Joe because she never felt remorseful for any of her actions throughout the show (not that remorse makes Joe’s actions any more redeemable) and was a complete hypocrite about Joe having an affair when she had one with a literal teenager (who she even acknowledged multiple times was too young for her). 

Joe deserves his due but so did Love 100%. She just got hers earlier than Joe but his time will come. I can’t imagine the writers giving a psychotic serial killing stalker a good ending no matter how much he “reforms” himself by the end.
I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted, but this was definitely a weak season with lots of forced plots. Getting obsessed over Marienne, after beck and love, was incredibly lame and redundant.
I agree with the whole Joe being obsessed thing is boring but it’s his flaw and it results in events that happen in the show so idk I really liked this season but that part is annoying
My thoughts exactly
Give her a chance
>!They just wrote her into insanity. She's somehow even more incoherent than the end of S2. In the beginning of S2 she was hyper-competent, detail-oriented, they completely changed her character (or forced some mental breakdown in her).!<
I thought season three was based upon book three? (Haven’t read the books)
Nah that kind of stuff is so distracting. Even though I agree with it all, it just is so odd to include. It’s equivalent to a product placement. It pulls me right out of the show and into the writers room. I hate when I can almost HEAR the writers in their little pow-wows figuring out how they can shove certain real-life narratives into a show without it ever feeling organic. Always ruins the immersion.
She got dosed with wolfsbane and got lit on fire, I seriously doubt she is still alive. If nothing else, if the cops managed to find the remains of a couple of Joe's toes, I doubt they would have assumed Love was dead if they couldn't find her remains.
LMAO! Emily annoyed the hell out of me. I am looking forward to this cross over. Insane! 🤣
There was a scene that showed Love hiding a key.
Joe hid his key on the frame railing and Love hid hers under a bag of sugar/flour.
Guy asking real questions.
Ummmm delete this
Ugly ?
If you hate black women just say that. That librarian is better looking than any of the other woman he pursued
fax
I didn't like her AS A CHARACTER. This is a completely different argument, and much more subjective at that. I can get the outcry.
Wtf is wrong with you people?
Same. I know they're both horrible people, but I just found her a tad bit interesting more than Joe.
You can’t tell me you predicted Gil killing himself! Or Sherry and Cary being swingers
I thought I was the only one!
You forget love had and affair ( multiple times) with an 18 year old kid.  Not saying love wasn't cool, but she definaly wasn't ride or die
she said don't ask
Big ass-baby

Could'nt agree more
So he wouldnt scream
I believe she was looking up names for the second child she was planning.
I feel that they wouldn't do that twice. lol
Of course he gonna try to bond with his kid. If he didn’t care about the baby he would have just killed love regardless at the end of season 2
Well said
They are
At least Love and Joe know they’re murderers.
His the main character. You are definitely watching the wrong show if you want him dead. Also if you don’t like it, don’t watch it next season
noooo they block pipes please never tell ppl to flush their tampons
\-that's exactly what they wanted you to think, and they subverted expectations

\-he didn't go the lengths because as we kinda saw, he is changing...I think he was sincere when he said he didn't want to kill unnecessarily.
would joe's story (love's suicide) blown up as much and, on a much bigger note, would the police have bought it if they wouldn't have found love's body in the house? i think she's dead for good
She annoyed me too. Shows how great Victoria Pedretti is as an actress!
Yeah I really thought we would get more of a combo killing team couple this season, it seemed a little blah to have them turn on each other so quickly. It's boring to go back to him alone doing the same thing over and over. I would MUCH rather have a whole new season with no Joe and the amazing Victoria Pedretti taking over but oh well.
I want a cary and sherry spin off!
In fairness, bar Joe, Love and Candace, the only characters that have ever appeared in more than one season have been either hallucinations or in the flashbacks, so I'm not all too surprised we didn't see Ellie this season, just as we didn't get to visit Paco again in S2 and I very highly doubt that Theo will appear in S4.
I think the characters this season was far weaker than season 2 characters, they weren't as interesting imo. 

Still love the chaos that Love caused and how Joe had to try and fix up her mess, and I thought the ending was great as in it didn't follow the typical ending we normally get in this series where literally everyone dies, I'm happy for a happy ending there, though I'm sad that Love died.
HOW IS THEO YOUR FAVE
I thought that too at first but realised that is only what Joe wanted. Love was never really comfortable with him being with someone else hence why she killed nathalie, wanted to kill marrienne and freaked out when he had sex with cherry. When love cheated she immediately felt guilt whereas Joe didn’t care
I (obviously) can’t guarantee she’s dead, but I think she’s dead. I believe it may have confirmed shes dead in that article that Matthew was reading, not sure though.
Victoria Pedretti is definitely a star in the making
No I wanted love to get caught I feel like joe was actually trying not to kill people and love was finding any reason to hurt someone. She was very erratic. I wanted her gone
Karen from S1 was black, so it's not like he just suddenly liked black women
Big fax. Just Netflix being Netflix. So much delusional nonsense. Equating covid vaccine to the measles vaccine was funny af. Also, blaming the justice system for favoring "white men" even tho 90% of custody cases are ruled in favor of the mother.
He left out the total cringe "white people don't season they food" line lmaooo
Amen
[deleted]
I mean unless you're anti-vaxx yourself, who cares?
Reality isn’t an “agenda”.
I thought it was epic
Thank you!! I am pro vax (and vaccinated myself) but Fuck it’s actually annoying how much they are targeting anti vaxxers🙄🙄. They are not going to get them to get vaccinated by telling them they are idiots 🙄 besides, someone really wants social political
Commentary when wanting to just binge Netflix?
Literally, typical shitlib Netflix to thank.
He's just saying what we're all thinking. Vaccinate your kids people.
I think she is cute, but I wasn't feeling their chemistry and she felt boring too.
Episode was named and done long before the Gabby case. Pure coincidence but missing white women syndrome has been an issue for decades.
who? the nurse?
I was so disappointed they didn't go down that road, it would been so good for tying into Joe's distorted perception of women!
Nope. He clearly had a crush on her but the show never suggests she was abusing him.
See you on HermanCain!
What was being compared?
Hard disagree
No. Love is insatiable and Joe is a romantic. They both don’t have their head rooted enough in life to realize the issues they were having in their marriage happens in all marriages- and that you’ll eventually end up bored no matter who you’re with.
How can you say fuck Joe but not Love.
They didn’t even mention the covid vaccine? But yeah it’s important.
I know right? That pesky reality always bringing us back to earth.
Did I miss them talking about the Covid vaccine? The I my vaccine I heard them talk about was measles which has been around for decades
Do you think a freaking vaccine is part of someone’s identity? No wonder you conservatives are so obsessed with identity politics.
ya that was way too obvious. sad tbh
All of those characters were name dropped
okay race baiter.
Nah fuck Theo what a lazy character
Reality isn’t “woke” you turd.
I don’t know I think that’s a stretch. You don’t see people calling Leonardo DiCaprio a pedophile and the age gap between him and his love interests are way bigger. Many celebrity men date and marry women half their age. 

Also, we don’t know how old Love is. 27 maybe? How many couple have you heard of/met with an 8 year age gap? 19 is a legal adult - it’s not pedophilia by any stretch of the means. 

Is it weird? Inappropriate? Yeah. They’re in two different stages of life physically and mentally. But a pedophile? No. Theo is not a child
The actor playing Theo is actually older that the actor who plays Love. But as long as he’s over 18, it’s not pedophilia. Might be gross, but not illegal. 50 year old men have been poaching 20 year old women since the beginning of time.
Ngl, I wasn't a fan of the first episode of two, but it gets really good as you go on. If you have already made the effort to watch the first 2 seasons, you might as well just finish it imo
She got her period at the vineyard
Whole show is embedded with woke feminism material
>!They do not!<
[deleted]
Yeah, I actually thought writing Love out was the natural next step. They’re both psychopaths and neither one was ever going to change.
Compersion
Vineyard seemed closeish, I pegged them for N. Bay residents. Madre reminded me of Sausalito
she bought it to spite her ex-husband (her husband's lawyers were probably right about that), and money wasn't in flux cause it was spent.
i thought she was gonna kill  marianne and then take her daughter and nick name her julia . i thought she maybes liked the name because her daughter was named juliette
that took me out a bit...definitely a surreal moment. I don't recall if past seasons really placed a year on things, but name dropping covid/anti-vaxxer etc. definitely dates things
They are apparently post-Covid in this world. Or at least that’s what I got from what was said
I feel like they could have left the Ellie part out if they weren't gonna do more to her story.
I agree, I like that you mention Breaking Bad. I hope they do end it that way where it all catches up to him and he eventually gets caught and dies. No way he can keep getting away like this. I like this show. I don't know why I was hoping for a happy ending between the two in this season, but ah Love was causing so many issues for them I actually blame her for how the whole season had to play out.
What foreshadowing are you talking about?
She did hire him, to find out what secret Gil was harboring
Marcia Cross popular for Desperate Housewives
He gave me "off" vibes when he first came on to Love in the parking lot. He was way too forward, no boundaries. That just snowballed as the season went on. He was so obsessed with her and he was torpedoing his own life.
I don’t think love would have let her mom fight for custody of her kid or even let Dante have him if she were alive idk how anyone could think she survived and would be shocked too if she was
You forgetting Paco and that chick from season 2, perhaps they will get a reappearance in the final season. (Hopefully it is the final season)
I don’t remember the episode number but it’s the episode where Dotti gets kicked out after taking their kid I think it was the library event one.
Why would he? Mystery is solved, Last he knew Joe was probably gonna be murdered.
The last two episodes are good imo, not predictable at all but I understand where you are coming from, also the characters in this season was weak as well.

They could have ended it at this season but season 4 really should be it's last, I think it's welcome its stay a bit too long.
what does 2021 have to do with anything?
I didn't quite get young Joe's storyline. So what exactly happened there? Young Joe murdered his abusive father and then his mother took him to some sort of youth facility and left him there while she was raising another child? Did I miss something?
I agree. There is was no connection between the characters Marianne and Joe. And now he is in Paris looking for her. Lame. I don’t want another season of that BS. He can obsess over someone new.
Love was at fault there and some people here wanted her to Kill Joe and be the star in the 4th season, I told them that she is not stable enough to carry the series by herself, every episode she would kill someone and it will get boring real soon, we have season 3 to prove that to us.
He was so lame. Dude would just come in say hi to Love and throw in that he is horny.
I thiiiink it was to insinuate that Love had gotten rid of his body in a bunch of ways, like cooking him into meals, helping to prove why they wouldn’t find his whole body after the fire.
The knife. She knew he would panic, grab a knife is possible self defense. It was kind of test. If he didnt try to kill her, he would’ve not gotten drugged.
Season one is still the weakness season for me, I think season 2 is better than season 3, maybe because I liked the dynamic of those two sisters in the last season and the most of the other characters and totally hated Theo in this season and Love new friends, though near the end I warmed up to love friends.

I'm a bit disappointed that Love died, but I'm happy that they didn't just kill off everyone just like previous season.

SEASON one, 7.5/10, season two 9.5/10, season 3, 8.5/10.
Both...Love took an axe to a realtor
Inherently Joe is the cause as he enabled love’s darkest tendencies but for me Joe really tried to change but unfortunately love drove all the madness in this season by being unwilling to control her impulses.

Also whilst Joe is egoistic and narcissistic in thinking he is a hero, he only really let the stalker unleashed when love push him to go on the bro trip that brought out the beast again
Yeah, I believe its a stylistic choice, because nearly every shot in this show has blurry edges or a weird depth-of-field.
ummmm everything think he is dead and that Love is the one that did all of that.
Hella traumatic. He really had everything.
In her monologue right after she yells "Hakuna Matata" she explains her rage perfectly. From her POV (and I'd mostly agree), it was a once-sided marriage, and he'd gaslighted her on multiple occasions. Her cheating was less pre-meditated, more of salve for her wounds than an active seeking for an out.
Do you not remember s2?
His the main character. Why wouldn’t he?
he protected his mom remember? So he keeps going for women who are like his mom — a pattern, the women he goes for are like lost lambs attracted to wolves.
Disagree…Joe’s note probably said that Love would soon find and kill him, so he wanted to get Henry to a safe place. He expressed that they weren’t to let the baby go back to Love, Dottie, or any of the other Quinn family (which is why that line about fighting Dottie in court was stated). The rest of the letter was joe telling Henry he loved him and always wanted to be in his life (making up for his mom never telling joe that).
I don’t. I think she told joe so he would leave Love. That was the moms intention: teach her daughter that her husband would also leave
I always felt that was happening in times of great stress. And that actually does sort of happen in real life. When you’re hyper focused on something, all the stuff in the peripheral gets blurry. At least for me.
But… he…. Never….. asked her to…..
Sadly, I don’t think they’re bringing Victoria back at all.
Don’t forget stalking
when love is screaming like a maniac about natalie's murder downstairs, she and joe hear a creak (i didn't hear it but the subtitles did). love and joe go back upstairs, unsure if sherry and cary were on the stairs (making the creak sound) and heard, or if the creak was just the house. sherry and cary try to act natural by trying to continue with the night.

imo, sherry and cary should've acted like angry about love and joe being so back-and-forth about the polyamory, and then tried to storm out. but in such a situation, of course they wouldn't be able to think clearly.
Netflix gave it to him
No. She is dead and he buried her.
S3:E8 .  21:39
the latter one.
Right?! Taylor had me getting emotional over serial killers!
YES! I thought that with Natalie, Gill, and when she was screaming about how she was the murderer. Like, Love!!! STOPPP
Doesn't he narrate "She'll kill her" at that very moment? I could be wrong, but yeah, I think it's heavily implied.
>!Surprised the police didn’t check those cameras either!<

Turn your spoilers on btw
They’re never bringing her back again. We’ll hear in passing that she got a scholarship to some boarding school and that will be that
Yea he's annoying af. And he and Love Quinn are dating irl now, lol
Lol agreed
I think because If Love died they would still be stuck and would starve.
Try what exactly?
I was the opposite 😂
I don't think either of them are supposed to be likeable...they are the same which is why he kept trying to convince himself he was killing for justifiable reasons.
Me too 😅
Agreed, it became extremely farfetched after season 2.
It’s a contingency in case the public safety department are able to salvage the house and what’s inside. 

The idea is for them to not look for his remains.
>!Joe admitted doing it when he was a kid but he and Marienne where in the system so that's why she could empathize with the situation and why she didn't judge him. And in Love's part, even if she believed her or not it wouldn't make a difference to go to the police because Marienne already had a trust issue with authority. She always said they wouldn't believe her with all her addiction record. Not to mention that they were kind of suspecting of her for her ex's death. She just wanted to leave with her daughter.!<
And I noticed that he paralyzed Love with wolfsbane, when their phrase was “I wolf you.”
I thought the chicken was because it was the dish she figured out was perfect for him in s2z
She didn’t plan on killing Joe though, she wanted to kill Marianne and have Joe watch. At first I noticed she was using the mitt to hold the knife while cutting the chicken and I thought it was just a weird blooper lol I was shocked when we realize why she did that, didn’t expect that at all
For the spoiler tags to show up on desktop, you need to remove the space on either end (seems like it works on mobile for some reason). But this is a full season discussion anyway, so you don't need to stress about spoilers.
At that time of cooking she wasn’t planning on killing Joe it was only until she spoke with Marrian she gained self worth and was influenced to kill Joe. But at the time she cooked, she was happy because she felt she was going to ‘fix the marriage’ that night. Knowing that night that planning to kill Mariam in order to save the marriage was enough to make her happy to cook.
Hi! I'm late to the party. I don't think she was planning on killing Joe. I don't know what she wanted, but she could've killed him immediately if she planned on it. She said killing her ex was an accident, that she just didn't want him to leave, so that's why she gave Joe a non-lethal dose via the knife. She may have wanted to convince him to stay. Or maybe you're right and she planned to kill Marienne in front of him first and then Joe next.
As soon as I saw the chicken I thought it was poisoned, but how did she actually administer the wolfsbain to him? She said "through the skin" so I was confused
But she wasn’t gonna end his life, just flip the script on him and have him be stuck with her
goosebumps!
Wasnt she doing that for him to love her again
I would have been happy....>!although love is just as bad or even worse than Joe. The impulsivity.. killing others left and right almost no remorse!<
no that wasn't the plan.... she was gonna kill the librarian but she couldn't because she had a kid so she tried to kill joe instead
I wondered this, too. Seemed weird that no one would visit
I really missed them this season
I think it was just a play off the whole keto diet fad that’s going on right now and kind of making fun of how pretentious and trend following the people of madre linda are. and raspberries are pretty low in sugar (I think even some keto people eat them) it was just a joke about how ridiculous and crazy Sherry is that she wouldn’t let her kids eat fruit
As someone who lives in the Southern Ca equivalent of this fictional suburbia (there is no Madre Linda), this is spot on. I think it was meant to show how diet and vanity-obsessed a lot of wealthy people are. It's ridiculous, but ties into the concept of control that Sherry told Love about from the cage. People are so brainwashed by diet fads that they don't see how absurd it is to just let kids be kids and eat things like chicken nuggets (or fruit, in this case). It's a tactic for attempting superiority over others.
Yeah the raspberries should’ve been fine, but I think it was more about Sherry didn’t want to accept Love right away so she was just complaining
Also, it just pisses me off how Joe just lost the love for love, even though they are clearly souls mates, Joe isn't going to find anyone more similar to him and I don't know if I can be invested in any more of Joe's partners because love was the perfect one. Joes back to square one and he didn't seem bothered he just killed his soul mate and wife, and his baby son, it's just so confusing
How’s your head?
🤦‍♀️omg you are so embarrassing.
This show makes it really hard to tell who’s knocked out and who’s dead
nah i knew that crazy bitch killed her
Yea knocked her out … with an ax
I thought she could be from the FBI and haunt joe
They would’ve been the real optimized couple lol
Yeah same, particularly when Joe noted at the start that she rented Gone Girl from the library - I thought we were gonna get an already set up by Natalie evidence to her husband ‘killing’ her, but her actually just running away/doing an Amy Dunn type thing, maybe with her faking diaries saying that her husband is abusive so when Love killed her the police would already think it was the husband. Shame they didn’t lean into that more.
Yeah I honestly thought she was gonna be stalking him
I think the problem is the Love we’re seeing this season wasn’t shown to us last season until after she killed Candace and we found out she killed Delilah. She was much more composed from Joe’s viewpoint last season. 

With that said though, I love her as a character lol
Weird cause she is my favorite character in the third season too. I’m really upset she is dead now, she became the character I enjoyed watching the most. I’m really gonna miss her
I finished the whole thing and I liked Beck more (which is telling)
Love got on my nerves the entire time
she annoyed the absolute hell out of me too!! so impulsive and irrational, it wasn’t even fun, just infuriating. the way she yelled about killing natalie, while guests were nearby, and then looking dumb and scared. she’s just an eternally miserable-looking hilary duff. made me miss beck so much, at least they had chemistry
It’s obvious why they did it. The theme of the season was some pretty heavy-handed black racial equity, and killing off a gorgeous blonde woman first and quickly to favor a gorgeous black woman is a statement. 

Also I’m not sure if the Missing White Woman Syndrome was coincidence (with Gabby Petito), or if that segment was added in light of recent events
I just finished this season and I'll say it Love IS THE PROBLEM...well was
what character? i assumed they just used some leftover guinevere lines from season 1 and had joe do most of the talking when she was on screen. another woman who joe projects all his shit on who doesn’t have an inner life of her own. 😂
Yeah. But then I read that nearly 70% of homicides from 2020 were unsolved...
Yep I was preparing to abandon session 3 if it was just going to be another obsession.. when this happened I was hooked
agreed this was becoming more and more unrealistic
It felt like the characters were back and forth all the time between loving and hating/being bored of each other. Love was constantly insanely in love with Joe in one episode, then in the next one she was bored again, then she was crazy sex with him, then she is cheating on him with the kid, then she is in love again, now she is bored.
I think that made sense because she knows that Joe doesn't love her. His loving someone is obsessive, but ultimately fleeting. He only loves women when they need him replicating his relationship his mom, but if they don't need him or show behavior similar to his, he's turned off.

This is also after Forty's brutal death in front of her. Her entire purpose in life was to protect him and has done so in a very unhealthy codependent way, and not only did she fail, but he tells her before he's shot in front of her, he knew what she's done (the line about tip-toeing the issue over the years) and rejects her by telling her she's going to fail as a mother.

This is one of her great fears, which we discover in their therapy session. Someone she loves deeply sees the ugly side of her and rejects her. But she could tell herself, at least I have Joe. Maybe that makes it worth it. But she knows she doesn't actually have him. And she's being rejected again.

She's so desperate for love, she clings on harder, and makes awful un premeditated decisions that in turn, makes her even unattractive/less desirable to Joe. So it's a cycle
the reviews are rave online, i wasn't sure about this season. there wasn't anyone likeable in my opinion. i liked that swinging couple the most and even they weren't that great.
Yea his entire obsession with her felt so weird. They didn't really fit together, it just seems like he was latching onto anyone who'd give him attention outside of Love because he felt trapped.

And the ENTIRE Theo plotline felt so creepy and stalkerish. I can understand Love projecting Forty onto him, but the entire bit ate up *so much* screentime for a whiny kid to keep repeating he was into an older married woman. Felt like it led to Matthew being underutilized as some possible force to compete with and everything just kind of resolved itself at the end no problem. Matthew finally pieces together what happened to the dead wife he was spiraling out of control for...and is just like slaps Joe and leaves with 'well good luck with that, bye'?? With another season coming up, I can't do another obsession of Joe's unless he has something else to worry about - whether it be an actual investigation, or another killer, or *something*. This season started strong but felt like it kept flailing and trying to fake us out with 'they're dead! nah jk, just knocked out' to pad the tension.
While I liked some of the side characters, this season I didn’t understand anyone’s motive. Theos immediately in love with Love, neighbor lady is immediately in love with Joe, I agree Joe and Marianne didn’t really have chemistry but at least there was some lead up. Also why did they move to the suburbs? Just for good schools? Because there are plenty of rich young parents putting their kids in good schools in LA, NYC etc. I think they just wanted to do the fun “murderers in suburbia” thing. Why did Carry bring a gun to the orgy? And obviously Joe is a psychopath but I was just annoyed with him this season. Love was right when she said she does fucking everything in this relationship whiles out cheating. 

Idk I liked this seasons suspense and not that it ever makes sense, but this season was way too disjointed for me
I agree Joe and Natalie had zero chemistry and she didn’t fit his profile at all. Joe has a definite type and she wasn’t it at all. I enjoyed the coverup storyline, but Natalie was a weird character choice. Don’t get me wrong, she was beautiful and smart, but Joe likes doe eyed ingenues and she was a self assured, mature (in attitude, I know they are actually close in age) and could see straight through people.
I agree with you on this one
Exactly. Joe was surprised all the time by whom Love killed and had to cover up. It was too stupid. Love shouldn't be so unhinged. The librarian was the worst choice and came out of nowhere.
Okay, I think I might be the only one saying this, but tbh I found season 3 not only to be rushed, but cringey… I really didn’t like some parts and there was a point where I forgot the show I was watching was You…
Yeah it was weird I found they're relationship the most boring and forcedd
Literally 😅
That is not the correct way of using that phrase. Token characters don't have a purpose in the plot of the story and are usually background characters. The young women (who happens to be a beautiful woman of color) has a well thought out back story.
"I'm a feminist" did it for me
Initially I really didn’t like Cary’s or Sherry’s characters but something about the time they spent together in the basement made me grow a bit fonder of them😂
SO many of Sherry’s lines were on point and hilarious 😂
When I heard this I cry laughed
I replayed this like 15 times, I was laughing so hard lmao!!
HAHAHA the irony in that line! It was one of my favorites
yeah season 3 had a lot of those cringe moments... it was uugh
Late the party here but I love that the writers didn’t get overly serious and sentimental when Sherry and Cary expressed their love for one another just before they found the key. What a perfect walk of the line between comedy and sincerity when Cary says “Until I met you, I had massive inflammation, undiagnosed lactose intolerance, and I did coke every weekend.” Hahahaha
I felt the pain of Love losing Joe’s respect and love for her. It was an overall interesting season with how they played rather more common marital problems but was based in psychopathy lol

I didn’t like the misogynistic tones either but didn’t really notice because Joe is a horrible person and deserved someone irrational…Just hard to say so knowing that Love killed innocent people too.
I think it's very intentional. You know how every season, they give us these insufferable characters - Peach, Forty, Sherry - and terrible people - Ron, that violent dude who cut off Joe's finger, Ryan - and later on make horrible things happen to them, to see if we'll fall into the trap of cheering on Joe when he kills/hurts them? I think it's the same with this. The writers are trying to see if we'll say, "Joe IS right, he had to kill Love because she's SOOO irrational and impulsive!" If we do, we've taken the writers' bait and fallen into Joe's trap by agreeing with his TERRIBLY ILLOGICAL reasoning lol! Love is certainly more impulsive than him - remember when she said "I didn't plan [Natalie's murder] like a fucking psychopath!!!" lolll. But that doesn't make her less intelligent or rational than him, and it certainly doesn't make her worse than he is!
I thought that exact thing too especially after he bough like $1000 worth of addy. The only explanation i could remember based on what we’ve been told was that hes really good at forging expensive editions of books and can make a couple thousand for each, like he did in season 2.
THIS!! Omg when he was living in that nice ass, fully furnished apartment in Brooklyn while working as a bookstore clerk? And he stopped making knock off books for Ellie half way through s3

Also Love wasn’t getting any money from either of her parents after the divorce was finalized
[deleted]
He stole rare books from the library this season. It sounds like he works with such rare books that they're worth a lot of money.
He sells expensive books. He stole few of the rare ones from the library, sold them on the Internet and send Ellie the money. He claims they are first edition or something and gets few thousand each time. Otherwise he just used Love's family money. If he stole 5 books, he could have gotten 10 000
That 4000sqft house in "the safest spot" in Silicon Valley would easily cost 5 million. (Maybe like Los Gatos, Los Altos Hills, or Woodside)
He was stealing books from library and selling them
They literally showed him sell an expensive antique book for ellie lol
Yes, could not understand this. Therapy is expensive and they did multiple of those. Kids and sitters are also expensive! Love's bakery had no one in it ever, except the last episode where all of a sudden there were people gossiping 🤣 and who's buying if everyone was supposedly sugar wheat everything free there! Joe was a volunteer but all that addy money spent. Those rare book profits he said he sent to Ellie so the source of income doesn't add up
Joe clearly gets his money from Onlyfans 😂
they both seemed to hardly work for a while there and i thought the library was a voluntary job..?
Suspension of disbelief
I’m sure even though Loves parents cut her off she still had assets, a trust, a big bank account. It’s not like she ever had to pay for anything in her life.
I wish they’d explain it more but if you’re willing to casually murder people you’re probably willing to obtain money however you can 😂
Yeah how TF is he able to keep getting new identities and passports? He's a volunteer librarian lmao.
! i bet he now inherits all of loves assets !
Same!!! I hope we get to see her next season like maybe she saw him die on the news and tracks him. Also I wonder if any of his other exes family and friends watched the news like HEY that's the guy.
I think I heard the actress had another gig so couldn’t be in this season
It's usually like that in shows and movies where the baby isn't a real character in the show
Nooooo thatd be so creepy
Same. Literally started around 5 or 6 pm Friday and stayed up till nearly 3am. Got up early and finished it and wow… I am still processing so much. Emotional whiplash for sure.
Could you be telling me something? You, the one who picks up my McDonald's and has sex with me mostly? You. You are tying to tell me I should do more. Give you more. Be more...for you. I'll be picking up the McDonald's tonight, I can promise you that...I can be that for you.
My partner watch the seasom with me it was good to do it.  Felt like couple's therapy :p
HAHAHAHAHA this comment.
Yeah so I’m having dreams that have Joe and Love in it. I binged season 1-3 and I don’t even know what to think. I want to watch season 4 but I’ve had to force myself to stop. I feel like I experienced everything that happened and are sharing emotions w the characters. The amazing camera quality, the different characters perspectives, and also ofc the toxic relationship that brings out the worst of each other (I’ve been in one myself). This is such a good show that immerses you into the story..
That sounds like the ideal scenario yet here I am at 5am on Reddit after binge watching the whole show
Lol this is literally me right now
sounds nice but i also just had the worst nightmares after finishing the season
I stayed up an hour after bingeing the whole show. Maybe my mind just works differently
True. I slept like crazy!
I kept laughing when he was like “omg love is a monster!!” Right after he murdered someone lol
@ this sub
I think the issue for Joe is that he wants to be a better person, and that in turn helps when you are with a good person. Love is not a good person, and she may be mentally ill, but I also think Joe is mentally ill because he’s also so delusional like her (maybe just not as bad, but still bad)—and so he wasn’t going to keep being in love with her. I never really liked Love because there was no method to her madness, while with Joe there is sometimes logic there and not *just* madness (though the madness is still there). I don’t think Love was better than Joe or that she was manipulated by him—I think Joe essentially met his match, and then she turned out to be more unstable than him, so she had to go. I don’t even think she would have been selfless enough to give up Henry like Joe did. But anyway, I’m glad Love’s gone, because dealing with Joe is enough insanity for the show 😂
I think they're going for the trauma bonding angle. All the women he goes for, he gets them by acknowledging their pain and trying to make them feel understood and not alone. It's predatory
I agree. Honestly Joe isn’t an interesting person at all?? He barely has any friends or makes connections with people either. If anything he’s creepy, always eavesdropping and gets really up close and personal with the women he’s interested in
Oh my god I would have loved that! Or even if she framed Joe for everything and then he's in jail so he's not completely written off and maybe she ends up tripping up and joe gets out at the end. Idk I would have loved to see her continue her "impulsiveness" haha.
Wholeheartedly agree with you about VP, she is a force and I would have been totally on board with following her rapid descent into complete madness while also trying to be a mother. I think people who genuinely like Joe (not just Penn) are attracted to toxicity and should probably do a deep dive in their psyche or consult a therapist
Lol I was actually happy to see Love go. It’s too much instability for me—Joe was enough, and then Love just plowed right in and made everything too chaotic for my liking 😂
I finished Saturday morning at 3 am and I’m just now processing EVERYTHING at 2:30 am on Sunday lol
I think there’s something very relatable about fear of abandonment. Even if she wasn’t crazy, her husband fell out of love with her and gaslit her at every turn. She desperately wanted to do whatever it took to have a satisfied husband and a happy family, but Joe was the worst possible choice. She was so well played by VP that I really felt her despair, her desperateness, how she’s constantly reaching for validation and being shut down at every turn. There’s something very human about one sided effort and I know exactly what you mean.
She still crazy tho, but I definitely get it in the context of her character.
Thankfully I didn’t get invested in Love and Joe. I just didn’t like how needy Love was and she never was just a psychopath for herself like Joe is. It would have been cool to see a strong/badass female serial killer rather than just a “crazy” woman. It’s just typical to make the woman unstable and unhinged, which in turn makes Joe the more sane one. Meh. >!I was happy when she went. But I was sad watching Joe’s childhood traumas, and that he had to give up Henry!< 😢
Yeah, if he did one thing right it is to give his child a good home rather than parents spending their time killing people and saying that it's a bonding experience. I think I never saw something as twisted as Love and Joe having the best sex of their lives after they kidnapped their friends with the intention of killing them.
[deleted]
There was?
Totally agree they were a blip. Would’ve preferred more from Theo and dad scene
Hilariously enough, the entire show completely flipped the script by the start of episode 5. It started off as Joe/Love and their psychopathic hijinks together, trying to navigate an insane relationship. And then it just turned into...Joe's stalking a pretty but pained girl again. Love pretty much turned into a plot device to move the show forward, so she did and said dumb shit whenever the plot required moving forward without thinking. Really a shame that it seems that's what we're going right back to again with Season 4.

It honestly seems like the first half of the season was written by an entirely different team.
the actor for Brandon comments on every you official ig post and I thought maybe he's super involved but he's barely there lmaoo
Yeah that part was weird af. Nobody cared about those characters and it just felt like a really manufactured/unrealistic attempt to wrap up loose ends with a voiceover cliche
I had the exact same thought. As soon as the Natalie/Gil storyline is wrapped up at the end of episode 4, the other neighbours became irrelevant, except for the men briefly appearing at Cary’s camping trip. It was so jarring when they reappeared in the final episode and suddenly Kiki needed cupcakes (I didn’t even remember her name until Love mentioned it). It’s exactly as you said - why should we care about these characters when the show stopped caring about them after episode 4?
Yeah I didn't get why they wrapped up their storylines too. I barely remembered their names until they said them in the last scene. Pretty irrelevant and should've focused more on the core characters (Theo +Matthew, Sherry + Cary, Dante, Marienne, etc.
Seriously! I kinda forgot who they were. I wanted to see what happens after Carey and Shari got out of the box! Did she find help outside the bakery? Was the person/people like WTF happened to you lady??
Idk I’m wondering if it’s a sign that season 4 is gonna be Joe going back there? Doesn’t Marienne still live there? And Henry does, I’d hope Joe wouldn’t completely leave his son permanently. Otherwise it was a stupid point to add but kinda funny and nice to know sherry and Cary made it out.
Ohh so that’s who they are. I wasn’t able to figure out from where I have see those faces during the voiceover. lol
I actually didn’t recognise who they were at the end lol, thanks for the explanation
Is Toxic Joe's baby from the swinging night
Wait, when was there a time jump?
I thought the same thing
I think it would have been cool if they were on the news or a podcast talking about her or something like that at the end.
Love said to Joe “I don’t have any fucking friends because of you” in one episode. I don’t remember which one but it was during a fight.
I mean to be fair, she was putting on an act last season
And then he got him again! Joe really does think he's the craftiest son of a bitch out there because he got away with some murders and can build a glass cage. He wasn't ready for a functional junkie narcissist that has peripheral vision.
he’s so goddamn annoying at this point i wanna see him get caught and the craziness that would ensue. i mean the show can’t go on forever and how many times do people really wanna watch the same thing in a different town. ALSO if you lose a toe it messes up your balance and a lot of people have to walk with a cane but knowing joe it will never be addressed just like his magical healing finger amputation js 🙄
Yeah that kinda thing wouldn’t really work in a small town vs in NYC where it would be easier to blend in
And Natalie in the beginning caught him following her a couple of times. I like how they made his disguise less effective this season than in one and two
Plus Marianne saw him stalking Natalie in the library, and Natalie knew it too
He should have learned his lesson after beck instant transmissioned across the street to cal him out on his shit
Joe isn't a perfect stalker nor a perfect killer. He has some skills and knowledge but he's quite mediocre, and the sole reason he's not dead/imprisoned is a huge dose of plot armour and silly movie logic which allows him to walk around violating private properties and killing people (and hide their bodies) without ever leaving traces behind him (though he makes noise, steals things, spreads his and others' blood everywhere, doesn't put gloves, and attacks people during the day in a lot of occasions)
I thought of this too
yeah i thought it was incredibly weird they mentioned covid only to have it never mentioned again/no one wearing masks. why even mention it at all? the writers on this show have really gone downhill.
I KNOW! he’s always leaving dna everywhere. like anyone he gets into a struggle with has his dna under their fingernails and the very LEAST.
that was incredibly satisfying to watch. until joe literally kills him (a local CELEBRITY) in front of a well lit building that would absolutely have cameras in/outside of it. but at this point nothing surprises me with this show.
I think she was dressed as Alice in Wonderland with the blue dress and the black hairband
Omggggg.... right?  That dress was BOMB.  Such a cute, subtle Alice-vibe.  The floral neckline -- it was perfect for that event.  I loved it, too.
SAME
SAME! If anyone can find a link I will love them forever. None of the fashion finder sites have it!
Ikr the lady is out of control in terms of everything else but when it comes to that hair and outfits she definitely got everything under control 😹
100%   
every time it was down and wavy just made her look stunning
Will we meet Victoria in Season 4?
https://www.shopyourtv.com/you-season-3-episode-6-loves-tie-waist-denim-jeans/ so many items are on that site! whoever runs it is a saint bc that’s how I ID and try to find the items secondhand.
The white one she was wearing at their double date with the Conrads when Theo stops by. I’m still thinking about that whole look 😍
Omg thanks for sharing this was trying to figure out where that brown cardigan in the last episode was from!
They have every except that blue dress 😞
You can’t kill Cary!

Haha I think that’s why they put that line in during the forest part.
omg me too! I was so happy to see they made it out alive haha
All hopped up on gludethyion
I so thought he wasn’t gonna make it and I was crying my eyes out lol
I honestly really loved that they got out and became successful, yeah sherry was a bitch at first but she started to show her real self and that cage showed her and her husband were truly meant for each other 👏🏽👏🏽 what a season
Well said
Yes, Cary brought so much comedic relief—I enjoyed him! Sherry was just an awful person throughout until she gave good advice to Love about choosing her soulmate and then when she got stuck in the cage. Real character growth! 🙌
Man, I felt that way about >!Beck. We saw her vulnerability and got to know her so well, so much so that I hoped she could kill Joe and get away. I was pretty unhappy he killed a good person I got attached to 🙁!< It gave me so much anxiety with Theo, Marienne, Cary, and Sherry lol.
I would have been fine with Sherry dying. She was a HORRIBLE person. The only thing that saved her in my eyes was that I knew she had kids. And then the cage when I started caring about her more than just being a mother lol.
[deleted]
How was Cary a horrible person? He never hurt anyone or had bad intentions. Sherry, on the other hand…
TBH, I really enjoyed S1&2, but almost all of S3 felt wrong for me. Not because of the venue change or new cast, but Joe felt wrong.  The instant he finds out that Love won't reject him and is, in fact, just like he is, he wants to be rid of her. So sad. Giving him an actual arc would be nice rather than just watching him blunder around doing the exact same routine in a different town with a different beautiful woman.

Is Love impulsive? Sure. Does it put them in awful situations? Absolutely. Do I blame Joe for everything in S3? No doubt about it.
I think we need therapy 🤡
Yes! I thought the measles was from them taking him out in the woods to bury her body. Like don’t some squirrels and wildlife in the US northwest carry the plague? Or that it came from the being in the cold rain
That would've made it even more dramatic 😂
god I completely forgot about the measles subplot, I know it played into the death of another person (further incriminating Love and Joe) but it felt like such a pointless hamfisted attempt at including COVID-relevant topics in the story that was easily forgettable by the end of the season lmao

Honestly, all the COVID-related/inspired plot points felt so silly and dramatized. I would have been perfectly fine with believing in a fictional version of modern day that just didn't have COVID. I mean, the entire point of watching shows like this is to escape from real life, isn't it? lol
Samee i thought the measles thing would link their interaction with natalia.
Omg honestly same I was Googling whether or not you could get measles that way haha
I 100% thought that's where it was going at first lol
same💀
same
Bruh same I thought that was going to link them to her death or something but nah
I thought this too!
omf i also thought that the measles was from dead body exposure - although i have no idea if that was actually possible
Me tooooo
I thought the sameee
Same here! I hated Sherry for being so fake and condescending, but cheered when she found the key. They both grew on me
I knew they had to find it since they showed it being hidden and it hadn’t came up yet
Yeah, I did not expect that I'd be rooting for a happy ending for those two lol
The best characters this season. Absolutely hilarious 🤣
I was surprised that neither joe or love changed the lock knowing the other would probably hide a key
I didn't like them at all, until the cave. They really deepened these characters out in those last two episodes. Damn they were great after all.
I was hugging my dog and whispering "please find it, please find it" in the last episode. They truly are a power couple.
So they got out? Can’t they tell the police everything?
Your comment has just made me notice that at their daughters party at the beginning they had a fake TedX stage for the kids, then by the end they were on the TedX stage themselves. Growth!
I thought they were obnoxious but now I fucking love them?
I like the plot twist of their relationship when they confess their insecurities towards each other. Sherry never felt good enough for him and Cary said everything he did was for her.
Man, their relationship seems nightmarish to me. Even by the end they were being totally fake and just trying to score some cash.

They are both living in a delusional world. They were only authentic with eachother when they are about to die.
They were!!! I hated them at first but towards the end the are so couple goals!!
they were bad but everyone else made them look better. grew to love them in the end. even tho the whole jerking off in the mirror thing was a little too much
That red flag purple flag green flag stuff was super impressive
Man, I at least like Carry since the beginning. Yeah he was a dude-bro, but even when we first meet him he was pretty nice, and tried to smooth over the cupcake situation a bit, and was friendly with the new neighbours
How interesting that would’ve been had they killed them both and then tried to cover it up. Hmmm
Why did you hate them and want them to be murdered on the swinging night?

They didn't force Joe and Love to be there. They asked them if they were interested, as adults, in having consensual group sex. Joe and Love agreed. Joe was the massive asshole of that episode, everyone else was having a good time, including Love up until the moment she realized Joe was zoning out to think about a woman who wasn't even in the room.
Yeah I kept waiting for them to take advantage of him being blind to have Joe get away with doing something sketchy. I’m glad it wasn’t a plot point, it was refreshing
I totally thought his blindness was going to lead to some wacky shenanigan where like Joe is stealing a book and Dante walks in on him so he has to remain completely still and avoid Dante groping around for him.
I loved when they showed Love sending him a voice message instead of a text
I didn’t even realize he was blind until several episodes in !
Agreed! The UK has been doing this for ages in a bunch of the BBC crime dramas I watch, and it’s awesome to see the US picking up on it. Like, hello, regular people have disabilities AND careers.
And James' deafness too. They just went into the whole ASL thing and didn't even address it. It's great.
Joe waits for his boss to go meet her lawyer and walk up to the Dante and asks for the key to do some paper work and ends up going through her computer...
I genuinely didn’t even notice he was blind till like half way through the season when he was prepping up Marienne for the court hearing and suddenly he gets up with a stick. I was so confused for a second lol I thought maybe he was making some obscure joke but nope he’s blind 😂
I know you made this comment forever ago but I just finished. My boyfriend got to like episode 7 or so (when he’s prepping Marianne for her custody hearing) before he realized Dante was blind. At that point I realized the only actual references to it were like 2 mentions and 1 scene with him with a cane. I was shocked he didn’t know but I guess he happened to be grabbing snacks during that scene or something lol
Did it so well I didn’t pick up on it at first. When Joe dropped off Henry I was like “why’s Joe just standing there? He’s gonna see him.” My girlfriend had to clue me in
yeah for sure man he was just waving around his walking stick for the fun of it 😂
Took me longer to figure out he was blind than it did to figure out he was gay and my gaydar is abysmal lol
[deleted]
If you've talked to a blind person, you'd be surprised that they actually know where your eyes are & look into them a lot of the times haha. You'd honestly forget that they're blind sometimes. I tried to high five a blind person once because I just forgot about it for a minute there🤣🤣 Even more surprising was that he asked me if I tried to high five him right afterwards. They have really good hearing and can hear your hand movements when you're wearing clothes that make a decent amount of noises. Plus, most legally blind people can still see something such as lights and shadows.
true but theres a bunch of actresses in their late 20s that played teens too
Yeah I looked up their ages and was instantly annoyed at that.  They just made Love seem so much older because she had a child.
The Actor who plays him Dylan Arnold is 27 She's 26. Must of been awkward when she was told somebody older would be playing her younger love interest
He definitely does not look like an actual 18 year old. A Hollywood one though, absolutely! Cuz they’re usually between the ages of 24 & 30. 🤣
18? He looks 18? Have y’all met 18 year olds lmao?
Idk how well [this](https://www.imdb.com/media/rm1576253184/nm4003553) will show up but the actor was in a movie that came out in 2012, so he would have been ~18 in that role if you want to see what he would actually look like at that age. There’s definitely a big difference jawline-wise.
Same I assumed he was like a college senior or something (so around 22)
Reminds me of Drew Barrymore in scream
Ned stark
The funny thing is Netflix has already done this w/ other properties. >!6 Underground? Dave Franco got axed in the first 20 minutes!!< 💀💀💀
Reminds me of the first guys killed in Squid Game. One of the dudes in an up and comer and I was shocked he got killed.
THEY ALWAYS DO THAT! On god
That was his season 2 development. His growth in season 2 was centered around him attempting to change and not kill anyone, and by the end of it he did end up changing mostly. In season 2, he only killed 2 people, one of which was in self defense and the other was an accident. He let Will go, and he was about to let Delilah go but was stopped by Love. When Joe thought he killed Delilah, he realized that he was not that great of a person and thought that no matter what he did, he would never change and it would be better off if he was in Jail or dead. This is why he threw away the key in the cage in season 2.

The growth stayed in season 3 sort of, but he started to revert after he saw Marienne and wanted to win her over, with him resorting to kill people again.
Like bro. I’m not a love depraved serial killer in the slightest and I would have probably tried to kill Ryan. god damn he was such and asshole
yeah it’s gross. it’s like the show is trying to make him the “good guy”. like if he protests just enough and acts like he has some semblance of morals now we are supposed to root for him. i hate him more every season. at his craziness and toxicity was more apparent in season one whereas they tried to make love the crazy villain this season and joe was stuck along for the ride. 

i knew love would die this season but it would have been way more refreshing to see all joe’s actions come back to bite him in the ass and he gets caught for everything (especially since he’s using the same name he used in new york). he’s left so many loose ends, evidence leading back to him, not to mention the trail of missing and dead people that follows him wherever he goes. white male privilege and a baseball cap can only get you so far in the age of cameras everywhere, extensive law enforcement databases, etc.
I do think, in the Head of Joe he made big steps to change as a person. But in my Opinion, all the seasons, especially the last just highlight that he does not change. In the end, in his Thinking, he is the only one of doing good work, he have to decide who have to die. The whole Henry Story hit me hard. Bringing a child into this sick worldview, damn.
Having Love puts him in perspective. He realized there is someone more insane than him.
So therapy helps.
Yeah but it didn’t sound like he had any intention of freeing Sherry and Cary, he was probably going to leave them to die/get discovered by the police.
The only thing is Joe’s patterns of killings are revolved around who his current obsession is so they don’t take away any attention. With Natalie being killed - he isn’t concerned about matthew hurting her or drawing her away from him because she’s dead lol. Sherry and Cary were Loves fault in his head. He still remained the same Joe and if anything his character is weakening and we aren’t shown enough depth as to why he so quickly now finds his obsessions. It’s like any attractive woman - bam! We had an entire season dedicated to beck and to Love. I don’t see where they can go with joe anymore. I’d prefer the latter and have next season be Love in another country because she’s more complex and not as predictable.
You know damn well Joe was going to end up killing Marianne somehow
Yeah whatever bro
I second that
I think all of that was bad writing not good character development. Maybe I’m wrong but I’m just saying.
Yeah, he’s like a dog chasing a car—he gives everything to chase it but doesn’t know what to do when he catches it. He fixates and he devotes his existence to a woman. Then, as we saw this season, if he actually married the woman of his obsession, had a kid with them, and even if she learned about the horrible things he’d done and accepted them, he’d still just get bored and move on to the next car to chase.
That would have been great honestly
Their relationship made me feel like Love was projecting her love (haha) towards Theo because she saw him like how she saw Forty. In a weird way Love always tries to protect and care for Theo. It also kinda felt like she took out her sexual frustration on Theo. Well minus the part where she bashed him in the head.
Will do darling
Hahaha indeed


Definitely a “yeah, I’m just gonna get outta here” situation
I mean they stopped coming to her so eh
@ MammothInterest LOOOOOL :))))
LMAOO😭I remember when they said they wanted to kill each other and she said “you guys are a lot of things but you aren’t murderers.” And then they both looked at each other
She looks like an older version of Gal Gadot
Have you seen the show "Losing Alice" on Apple TV? I really liked her in that.
That’s Deadpool!
Huh? The actreess that played their therapist this season also played Vanessa on Daredevil
1. As said explicitly in the show, she likes to try to fix broken people. Then there's this neighborhood kid with a distant stepdad and a dead stepmom who doesn't feel like he could talk to anyone in the town. 

2. Theo reminded her of Forty, and Love's relationship with Forty was co-dependent and... too close and intimate for normal siblings, even for twins.
why
I agree. Those last few episodes of season 2 were just so gripping, and actually emotionally engaging. 

This season? Idk... maybe it's just me, but I never really felt that INVESTED in it. Like it was good, but I was never particularly worried, or stressed out, or engaged with it that much. And I felt like the end just felt so so so much less climactic than the end of the first two seasons, but maybe thats just cuz we're used to it at this point.

Honestly, I hope the next season is the last.
acid episode was peak netflix
Watch other shows
I 100% feel the same way. 

I'm kinda pissed that Victoria's character dies in literally every show she has been on. Like.. can we please have a Vic happy ending? Is that too much to ask for?
YES!! i’m so pissed they killed her off. she added so much dimension to this season and was a character that i loved. joe was getting super stale and she made everything so much more interesting
I 100% agree with you. Like, the death of Love left me feeling kind of sad that I won’t see her character interact more with Joe? Like someone said previously, I felt that the shine of this season were Joe and Love being psychopaths in a relationship trying to live and raise a child to be normal. With her out of the picture, we might go back to S1 plot which they are not bad but like … meh
I’m sorry but the “dumbass fucking creep” had me rolling cause you’re so right 😭😭💀
I'm excuse me, you're pronouncing Cary wrong.
bonk
Guess you got your wish lmao. Joe shortly explaining the effects of injection as opposed to other ways of poisoning was enough to make me wince. Well, that and VP's scream
do you mean: every conversation joe has marianne
I had to pause this episode at least 5 times throughout and do a lap around my house before coming back. It stressed me out that much.
Aw that ending man. Why??? 

Forgive me I need a place to let off steam.
Sooo good!!
not true? he still cared for paco, his mom, and ellie… even forty. joe was just a fucking dick this season.
All the women Joe has stalked have been flawed in some pretty clear ways. Though I'd point out that Marienne told him several times to stop hitting on her because he was married and she only truly entertains the idea of a real relationship with him once he lies and claims he's leaving his wife. 

The thing is Joe is a compulsive serial predator who finds vulnerable women to prey upon by learning all he can about them and inserting himself into their lives, isolating them from their friends and family and making himself their only real source of love and protection. There was no relationship to ruin with Love because he had already lost interest in stalking her. She only even lived as long as she did because she was pregnant. He was fully willing to slit her throat at the end of season 2 once all that "love" he felt for her evaporated in minutes and he starts off season 3 with another obsession that he also quickly gets over because none of these women actually matter to Joe except as an outlet for his violent, creepy compulsions.
Joe literally kept preying on her, especially once he knew her insecurities and saw her in a vulnerable state. Marienne was a single mother with no friends (except for Dante), who was being psychologically abused by her ex husband. She constantly told Joe to stop, and he ignored it. Moreover, she was on a particularly vulnerable position; she was fighting custody for her child, dealing with her abusive ex and keeping sober. Joe kept telling her that his marriage was pretty much over, to make it okay for them to have an affair, as Marienne refused to break up a family. She was not ruining Joe's relationship with Love. Joe made her his target. 
That's the dangerous thing about people like Joe, they are insidious, you don't know who they are until they have warped around you completely and by then (like Beck and Love) it is too late to react. 
(Almost) Nobody on their right mind would think about being with someone like Joe, yet, many people end up in relationships with people like him. Because they are manipulative and they camouflage just enough to make it seem like they are a great catch. 
At the end of the day, I really liked that Marienne acknowledged that, although Joe was manipulating her (and a lot of the blame is on him), she also has a thing for people who display toxic behaviors. And that is also important to highlight, as it shows how intricate these types of relationships can actually be.
lol delusional. Yes SHES definitely the one who ruined their relationship. Interesting how you didnt say this about Natalie
His obsession with Marianne bothered you, but not Natalie?
10/10 would camp with Cary. Dude's a bro.
"it's ok you can look at it. LOOK AT MY DICK JOE"
I grew up in an area densely populated by wilderness bros and was able to translate what he was saying without help. Never realized this was a skill until I watched that episode.
“Don’t be hysterical. I joined a seminar.”
Van vinkle's acting never disappoints 😄..
His work in "The Last Ship" was also amazing.
Dinner doesn't get an opinion.
best line in this thread lol
Same!  I definitely enjoyed them much more during their cage scenes, but I still wanted them to die.
I thought that since the bakery was making money, he would send money from those funds, but since he doesn't want the Quinns to know she's outhere, maybe that's not the case at all. 

Maybe she just left her high and dry, uncharacteristic of Joe, but then he's a stalker/serial killer. It wouldn't be the worst he's done.
[removed]
They mentioned it in the beginning, and like one other time where he stole the book to sell for her
I think in one of those episodes though Joe mentions “if Ellie ever reaches out to me again for money”. It makes it sound like she knows where he is and can reach him if she needs to (and did several times) but it appears she stopped. Probably best to stop getting money from Joe and having any association with Joe ASAP. Hoping she found a job and is having a happier healthier life… poor girl.
tbh only marienne would do that

ellie probably believes love is the problem not joe

paco basically thinks joe a saint he did close the door to beck
Ellie doesn't think Joe is behind it all. She still kept in contact with him for money, and we see her sending him messages at the end of Season 2.

Paco is already corrupted by Joe, and is likely gonna turn out the same way.

All Marienne knows is that Love, who would later be revealed to be a serial killer, told her that he killed Ryan - before confessing she did it herself. At best, she doesn't know what to think, at worst, she thinks it was actually Love.

Marienne probably just wants to chill with her daughter and have nothing to do with Joe.
Yes, if he had a girl she'd be the new woman in his life to love and protect and he could break his cycle.  
A boy he'd have to figure out how to raise and not end up like himself.  
Was glad with the way things ended for Henry at least.
The latter, the former is a rationalisation
Gross
Most women in Joe’s life aren’t nice either.
No you're right. They hid those keys from one another because they truly couldn't trust each other.
I suppose I understand the thematic concept behind it (it represents Joe's true self and whoever "sees" it can't survive,  blah, blah, blah), but the practicality  and believability of him continously recreating it is wearing thin fast as fuck.
lol I didn’t even think about that!! Of course he’s shipped the bloody thing to Paris. Genius! lmao
Oh, goodie, did Joe take over for Mona with keeping Alex & Mary prisoner in the basement of a cafe there when she left back to the states?
LMAO SHIPPED
Yup! ;)
LMAOOO STOPP
omg i'm cackling at this lmaooo
Coz they built together it like an Ikea bookshelf. Carrying glass and metal into a bakery is not nearly as suspicious as doing construction work in a storage unit, I think.
Yeah there were interesting tidbits in the library, like how the book titles were organized. Some of them were chosen to stand out which foreshadowed the story.
You know what I thought was interesting? When the writers room sat down and all decided "yes, we should kill off the literal Yin to Joe's Yang, Love"
It's like an inverted Gone Girl.
Good thing for Joe then that nobody really knew her well except Fourty.
lool
Lol yeah for sure
[deleted]
I’m pretty sure it was alluded she murdered him in season 2? Or at least when she said she killed him this season I wasn’t surprised since we knew she skilled the maid as a kid , Candace and Delilah already in season 2
Agreed, you can tell while watching season 2 she wasn’t nearly always as unhinged as S3 wants us to believe. The writers really butchered her character.
I didn’t notice how handsome he was until that scene lmao
He’s so hot I literally couldn’t focus on anything else all of S2
I only just rewatched a recap after finishing the episode and I forgot how fucking adorable he was. I also completely forgot about the acid trip episode.
He's perfect 🥰
Have you seen pictures of him with longer hair and without a beard? He looks eerily like Penn Badgley. I always thought that was maybe intentional, Love picking a mate that looks exactly like her twin. It added a creepiness that seemed like an early indication that girl was not all there in the head.
I loved him in the Heathers reboot and he's great in this too.
My partner said the same thing, but I kind of interpreted it as the two of them being back together sharing a womb, especially considering the title of the episode.
I had that moment but then I remember how exceptionally different their twin thing is from normal siblings
And then when he’s singing to her on the bed 😭
Joe was perfect for Love, but she's not perfect for him. He fell out of love with her the moment he realized she was actually a conniving murderer like him. He doesn't want an equal, a 'partner in crime' (lol literally), he wants a helpless, vulnerable damsel to protect. I think she only went for Theo because she missed Joe being obsessed with her, but he was always going to stray.

Same reason a lot of guys in bands want to date the groupie, not a fellow musician.
Perfect for each other? I think it became very clear early in the season that they were not perfect for each other and were trying to force it for most of the time. I knew they wouldn’t end up together, just wasn’t sure how they were gonna get out without killing each other
How are you sad a murderer is dead
Exactly. I know it’s just a show but.. I thought they could help each other heal from their pasts and move forward. As joe, It would be hard to move on in life with out a companion who already knows everything he’s done and can completely relate. Joe already expresses his struggles and has to completely justify exactly why he killed each person.. he has shame and a guilty conscience. Hard to live with that shame alone. I guess he wanted to move past being a murderer so getting rid of Love would do that… but in the end, he is going to continue to kill people anyways… so wtf
I don't agree as much as I enjoyed her scenes. Joe is still the main character of the story and I think the point of this season was to show that because they're so similar, it was kill or be killed. There was no other way this was going to end. They're not people that can change or get better, they are far too petty, aggressive, impulsive and passionate to have a stable marriage.
That why the book is better. The show ruined love. They made her the vilian to prop up Joe
Love was a great character but I really wish they didn't make her that fucking dumb. The entire Conrads situation was just cause she yelled she killed Natalie, like why was that necessary?
I agree with you. Love is such a compelling character. I loved the edge she brings- she also has the capacity to kill. There was tension through S3 where you think each of them might off the other. She was easily the most interest8ng of Joe’s obsessions imho because she was his equal in so many ways.
I mean hell, S2 was kind of a bore before the Love reveal. S3 started off strong thanks to Love!
If Love survived then Season 4 could just be another repeat of this Season as well though. That being said though, hopefully they have something unique & interesting planned for Season 4.
Marianne is more boring than Beck. She and Joe have no chemistry, and the sob story got old fast. I really hope she’s not a main character next season.
I think we're in for another wild ride with this new girl considering previous roles she's played in.
Im not sure i could handle another roller coaster like s3 with her killing person after person (killed 1, caused 1 to kill himself, almost killed Theo, Sherry and Cherry). The only 2 joe killed were the new girls ex and (sadly but necessary), Love.
THIS. They had no chemistry, and her as an actress- she just wasn’t believable to me. She seemed too smooth in her voice and moves.
I liked Marienne the character, I liked the actress, I found her interesting, but overall I found the second half of this season mediocre (aside from Sherry and Cary, who were the best). It was boring after an exciting first half of the season where they'd mixed up the formula to go through the second half of the season where Joe just repeated the same formula as in seasons 1 and 2. It felt stale.
Didn’t she die due to overdose? Pretty sure she couldn’t breathe because she became so paralyzed.
I doubt that tbh, even if she could’ve survived the fire she was paralyzed so couldn’t run out
definitely agree with you on this, i found the ending to be kind of disappointing. i really think killing off love was a mistake, and the move to paris wasnt very interesting. joe is just too static, his character really needs more change and growth as compared to love, who was dynamic and unpredictable. im also sad to see that love was portrayed as just a psychotic woman towards the end, like with how joe treated love and how he staged their death. played a little too much into the crazy woman trope i think
>Needless to say, Season 3 delivered on that 'chaotic nature'...for the first 4 episodes.  
>  
>Those first 4 episodes were wildly insane, with moment after moment stacking on digging the couple deeper into the hole. 

YES. The first half of this season was excellent. The second half, aside from the amazing characters of Sherry and Cary, was poor. Lazy/sloppy writing, and stale character progression of Joe. For the first time in the series I just found Joe annoying, while all the other characters around Joe were interesting and likable even if flawed.
LMAO same!! But ofc Joe had to stay one step ahead, oh well :(
💯 their arc was completed. Another season of him cleaning up her messes would be boring.
Joe was a thousand times more annoying in the second half of this season than Love was. By the last 3 episodes his constant internal quips usually just made him sound like an idiot.
Overall i liked it but I’m disappointed by the ending. Are they really just going to do the same thing again but in a different country? Was hoping they would mix things but which they did this season with joe having a wife and kids and all but now it just seems they’re going to do the same thing as season 1 and 2 only in france.

*pretends to be shocked* 😱
damn tag yor spoilers people
He seems to kill less people each season, so far.
Nah, I think season 4 will be his reckoning. He will find and stalk her again and finally one day she actually sees that he’s alive. Remember, his thoughts during the last time he saw her were that she only said those things to get out of the situation. In his obsessive state of mind, he actually thinks there could be a future for them, hence searching for her in Paris. Her reaction will not be what he was hoping to get and this will throw her off his pedestal. She’s a tough cookie with a rough past, she will fight. In the end, it will be his obsession with her that will be his downfall. He could’ve disappeared to anywhere in the world and just lived out the rest of his life but he chose to chase after her. He will of course have a poetic death, in his cage.
Baseball cap disguise

Infiltrates anyone's home

Probably gets into someone's laptop and the Password is something ridiculously easy like HOTDOG
this is one of my favorite shows but I really want next season to be something else. i thought this season would be more different in terms of formula but it felt like the journey that Joe takes in season 2, only in reverse.
*sacre bleu!*
Also, reads, makes book references, builds a glass cage
I just binge watched it and iirc he did identify his patterns. I remembered him saying it when he was trying to figure out why he was obsessing over Marienne. But he acted like he immediately forgot right afterward.
He's not emotionally intelligent though
[deleted]
But his son figured it out in minutes....
I also thought of something similar... I am so done with Joe's cycle of finding a target, obsessing over her, comitting murders in the pursuit and getting away, rinse and repeat... Love should have been made the protagonist moving forward
How do you know she didn't? It wouldn't be insane for her to give herself a antidote, to make sure she doesn't accidentally kill herself in the finale. I mean she was growing them, they could of harmed her on accident duing growing alone. she pretends to be paralyzed just like joe did, he runs off, she follows him (like candice), but unlike his last stalker going for moral revenge, love goes for immoral revenge and goes on a killing spree framing joe as she goes doing the whole 'serial killer taunts detectives' trope vs joe, maybe even kidnaps and tortures his new obsession as love toys with joe.  


Now thats a good S4 plot, professional serial killer battle of wits.
Honestly, Loves uncontrolled maiming and blurting things would when upset was getting on my nerves. The things with the Conrads was so stupid, did she  really have to shout that she killed the neighbour?? no and yet :|

Oddly enough I didn't have to much of an issue with Love until her mom called her spoiled, and then I was like YEA, SHE IS and, I am hiding my feminist card for this, JUST FUCKING CRAZY!  Victoria Pedretti is an amazing actor, I fall for her characters every time.
Yeah I was rooting for her after she left Marianne go. Would have loved for her to move to somewhere new and start over too. I wouldn't have minded if she killed Joe and I really like Victoria Pedretti! I like Penn Badgley but I like her too!
YESS i totally agree with you, or maybe she lives happily ever after somehow LOL >!im so upset he got away with it, is no one checking finger prints, they left fingie prints all over the place this season!!!! i was so ready for love to realize she deserves better and kill this asshole!!!!!!!!!! ughhh!<
Spoiler tags work like this, by the way: add > ! to the beginning and ! < to the end (without the spaces).

>!Looks like this.!<
I was so hoping for this! Love was so much more interesting than joe 😭
Totally agree, they ruined the characters with this drama-heavy writing, it felt almost hyperactive with Joe jumping from person to person. I would've much preferred more Love+Joe stuff instead of this dramatic nonsense.
Yeah, it felt like the season was starting off REALLY strong with them killing the main obsession right away and having Joe deal with his bullshit. I remember when Season 2 ended that I was a bit frustrated with the cliffhanger of Joe being potentially being obsessed with the neighbour. Then the first episode of this season had me shocked.

It really felt like after the first half of the season they suddenly decided to pick some other woman in the cast to be the next obsession and go back to the roots of the show of Joe being obsessed over a new girl, but then had to deal with the problem of Love still being around and their marriage going back to being solid.
I’m at least a bit relief to learn I’m not the only one who wasn’t satisfied. They made some really weird decisions and the writing was all over the place. Like, one episode Joe and Love are totally into each other, the next one they hate each other, then they love each other again.

They were both completely deranged, but the season shines the most when they’re both working together, as opposed to antagonizing each other. The whole Marianne thing wasn’t really convincing, she wasn’t that interesting and I rolled my eyes with Joe’s constant obsession about her. I really wish the show would grow past that. I keep telling myself that the show not taking the direction I wish it did does not necessarily make it bad, but I mean, it’s not like they did that to explore new possibilities. They did it to milk the hell out of it with story we’ve all seen before. A shame they got rid of Love and Victoria Pedreti in the process. Probably won’t be coming back next season.
I agree , to me it was all over the place , and felt rushed , maybe because of Covid … they were too back and forth about each other .. And they made Joe so unlikeable that I don’t know if his character can be redeemed … the whole thing with the neighbor doing his own investigation about his wife missing so many things that were on the tapes , then his son looks one time and BAM! Figures it out lol that was so dumb .. and the unrealistic bakery love opened ! No workers , hardly no money .. idk it didn’t make sense to me . The whole season had opportunities to be great , but failed to do so.
> I feel the direction of the story took a major turn just to milk drama for the sake of drama instead of character growth or story progression

My thoughts exactly. They packed too much into it, opting for flash over substance. I didn't hate it, but I don't see myself going back to Season 3 to rewatch like I (still) do for Seasons 1 and 2.
yeah me too, this just might be the last season i watch. it had a really strong start, but it all went wrong somewhere in the middle of it.
>Watching grown people not have enough common sense to make it safely out the house and then go to the police with the information was so frustrating.

Sherry and Cary would have known that Joe and Love suspected they had heard Love yelling, and therefore be targets. They had every reason to try to escape rather than just hope admitted murderers would assume they hadn't heard a yelled confession from right downstairs... Especially given how awkward Joe and Love were when they went back upstairs to them..
First, Love is never a sane person. Her impulsive decisions is her normality. Girl showing signs of personality disorder particularly borderline personality disorder.

Joe is continuing his viscous cycle and you can’t assume he will stop. Dude may have improved but damn, justifying murder is still screwed up in our society who doesn’t endorse murder.
“love killing for absolute survival” 

she literally killed delilah cause she was jealous. no other reason. her impulsively killing Natalie and whoever else is just in her character.
The problem is from Joe perspective Love isn't right for him because she is a murderer. He doesn't want the female version of him. He wants someone who is "pure" and needs protection. His perfect woman doesn't exist.
It had already been hinted in season 2 that Love killed her husband.  They didn’t change who she was this season.  It wasn’t even revealed that she was a murderer til the end of season 2.  And she killed her first husband out of fear of abandonment and everyone else to protect her relationship with Joe.  That continued in this season.  She attacked people who she perceived as threats to her or her baby.  I’ll admit at times it was written to make her look way too uncalculating in the way Joe is
I think they paint Love to look and be a certain way in the second season to then lead into the third because we didn’t see her tiny amount of craziness until the end of season 2 so they had to make her seem different for that entire season to lead into her character being a crazy person. We got a taste of the real Love in season 2 at the end and now in season 3 we see who she really is and I think people are just so attached to the Love from all of season 2 (non-crazy love) up until she kills delilah and we know she’s just as crazy.
I think season 4 will be about his life catching up with him. Peach’s P.I., Theo and his dad (remember, Theo still has that thumb drive), Ellie, Sherry and Cary…there are a lot of people out there who could take Joe down and this season showed how careless he can be (i.e. Ryan spotting him at the meetings and gym and calling him out about it).
Yes the new Love was too unhinged moody and Joe at first acted just as a cover up.
Why is she given a pass in this?  She’s literally just as bad
They're both sociopaths! They're perfect for each other, but can't have a perfect life together. Someone's always gonna get killed.
Yet Joe impulsively/recklessly killed Ryan (news reporter) out of passion...just like Love did to Natalie. Love and Joe both only killed one person this season (until the end). Love acted overall more recklessly due to her 'golden parachute' upbringing, whereas Joe remained somewhat calculated. They complimented each other so well in that regard.
Joe is a serial killer and he proven time and again he can't stop. He always says he wants to be a good guy but yet always ends up murdering someone. I know people believe joe will stop but he gets obsessed way too easily for that to be true to me. Love was a problem but I 100% believe he would have eventually killed Natalie just like every other girl that he stalks.
Which Joe did not like. All season he called her a monster
I’m really gonna miss her on this show, she did a great job
Ya her acting is incredible. The writing for her character this season, not so much.
Her makeup changes about halfway through this season. From being lined all the way around to being more artful.
Yeah, she's a great actress. She had some great moments, but her character in s3 was annoying though.
Lol they’re both in the wrong but yes she’s way more hypocritical lol.
Exactly. Her mother was right.
THIS WAS HER MOST TOXIC TRAIT! In couples therapy, she's \*genuinely\* annoyed that people "keep saying she's impulsive." 

Lady, did you forget that you just murdered three women, one with a literal \*broken bottle\* you found in the trash?
Sorta true, and looking back at it Joe may not have killed anyone if she hadn’t murdered the lady.  Not likely though
She kills/whacks people and expects Joe to clean up her mess every single time
I think a lot has to do with everything that happened to Love at once though - grieving because of Forty and moving away from loved ones, giving birth and feeling that the husband isn’t connecting with her or the baby, and living with the person who almost slit her throat would def explain her impulsiveness and shift in character.
And she was the only one doing that?
I'm still recovering from seeing that scene today lol. It's the sickest thing
I want Love to lick me like that. 
Had to pause it and take care of a few thing after that scene.
Some would say I was for it
Well Joe did say that Love used to be more crazier in sex and now she was boring.
exactly, the ones in season 1 seemed well-placed and added interest, but these were cheap
stranger things
A decent take! Quite possible
Beck's character was really frustrating for me but the actress who played her did a great job. I don't think people hate the actress, her character just has a lot of unlikeable traits that people are more likely to encounter in real life than a serial killer, that's all.
To be honest both Victoria and Elizabeth Lail who plays Beck are great actresses, only prefer both of them to Penn
I felt like I could relate to the criticisms of suburban life. From being forced to conform to neighborhood standards, to only living there for the schools, and with so little to do it becomes all too easy to inject yourself in your neighbors' business. Hell, in my house right above the front door, there is a giant tinted plane of glass and the wall next to the door is covered in mirror to the ceiling and the door has a small, ascending flight of stairs so you can view the tinted glass at eye level from the top of the stairs. From this setup, you can observe down the street one way and around the corner the other way. You can cover the opposite direction through a large window with chest height obstructions in the form of hedge in the living room, giving one a hidden view of the entire street. My family and I quickly came to the conclusion that the previous owner or some other predecessor were watching the neighbors.
I really hope it turns more into Joe becoming an actual fugitive and running out of ways to keep a normal life
I loved that they shit on the suburbs. That's a life I never want for myself.
She died the same way she killed her first husband
So does the private detective that the Salinger’s hired at the end of S1.

How do you bring that guy up and never mention him again? He was clearly suspicious of Joe and then Joe mysteriously vanishes from NYC without a trace right after a ton of murders and he never follows up on it?
oh my god somehow i always go back to that jar every now and then when i think of the show and wonder exactly how that still never came back to bite him. how come all these people keep on dying everywhere he moves and he's incredibly slacky with evidence and yet doens't get investigated in the slightest!
It is possible they couldn't get any DNA from it.
Oh ya. It would make ZERO sense. But the Candace thing didn’t either. If we’re going to throw any realism out of it, why the hell not bring back Peach? The writing would be terrible and it’d be super forced, but I could see Peach emerging from some Parisian alley and saying, “I’ve been watching you, Joseph…” with some ridiculous backstory about how she was in a coma, then following him under a new identity and waiting for him to slip up so she could prove he killed Beck. Again, I do not endorse this, as it’s absolutely nuts. But it’d be fun to watch them spar again.
I agree! I looked up the actress Marianne and she is half asian(korean), like shay Mitchell(half Filipino).
I think so, too!
Yeah, that was never explained.
Lol there’s a lot of people who should have told the police about Joe by now
I’m the opposite. Can’t remember a single name from s2 (who’s Ellie?) but remember Peach fondly.
Glad I wasn't the only one thinking this, lol
And the fact that Joe is also from Brooklyn NYC!
Can you explain how it's a nod to gossip girl I dont get it
I'm guessing by that you mean the "Their baby's name is literally all blood" I mean like y'know there's Hendy (dead) Forty (dead) Quinn (Blood Money)  


Hope you're doing alright :\[
For real
Second she asked him for the key back his mind questioned what was going to happen next
And she just lost her twin brother on top of it all.
That’s a really good point. Maybe it would’ve felt more in character if they leaned into that aspect more.
I’m also surprised that there was just no fallout at all from the affair with the teenager? Like, Joe confronts her about it and they’re like “yep, that happened,” and then we breeze by it. So why even have that plot line if it’s going to be completely inconsequential?
Yes!!! Exactly this. I’m intuitive enough that I can figure out “Oh, she’s unhinged because Forty died,” but SHOW IT. Instead of creepy incest-lite bathtub scenes, maybe have her actually mention the grief to their shrink or something? Idk just, it felt like this huge thing bubbling under the surface and causing her to act out but they never really address it.
I didn’t realize people liked season 2, that was a recurring theme among comments less fond of season 3.
whats the name of the film?
i believe Love was his mirror. and that is the whole point in her character. im hoping that by killing her, hes killed a part of himself.
I think you don't hear her monologue because she isn't the main character
Joe narrates the show. I'm sure if Love was the narrator, we'd hear all her plans & justifications & Joe would look like an unhinged lunatic (I mean, he already does to me & hopefully most other people, but you know). Joe has impulsively killed plenty of people with no plan whatsoever, or at least no more plan than Love had when she clocked Theo with the fire extinguisher. He had Beck in the cage for how many days & he STILL didn't plan to kill her or have some master plan for getting away with it. He snapped & then he got lucky.
I think that's a big part of why they didn't work, she's more of a spree killer, (murderers who are very reckless and tend to get caught by police faster)--and Joe is far more methodical.
>when Love does it she doesn't have an inner monologue to it

The show chooses not to let us hear her inner monologue (aside from that one episode). That's a big difference.
We must have watched different shows. How is Joe hypocritical? The ONLY argument for Joe being a hypocrite is him falling out of love with Love when he finds out she is a ruthless murderer and calling her a psycho despite him also being a murderer. Sure, this argument holds water if you look at from a basic general perspective but if you delve into his reasons its completely understandable. Joe's whole character growth of season 2 was him trying to become a better man and change his murderous ways. He only killed two people, Henry and the black market dude. Black market dude was self defence and Henderson was an accident. He was going to let Delilah go free despite everything she knew even though that was a huge impediment to him. He even pushes away the key and accepts the responsibility for his actions when he believes he killed Delilah because he felt that even though he was desperately trying to change he would still always be dangerous to anyone he cared about. In season 3, he only killed the librarians ex because he was AN ACTUAL monster. Everyone else who died was a result of Love. This is why he could never love her. He saw everything he hated about himself in her tenfold and who could love the embodiment of everything they despised about themselves. Love, on the other hand, did not share his willingness to be a better human being. She was impulsive, HYPOCRITICAL, and selfish the whole season. She would murder anyone who hurt her fragile feelings and then BLAMED JOE for it instead of taking responsibility for her actions. Love was the true hypocrite. She would kill any woman who he gave the slightest bit of attention to and then what does she do? She has an affair, with a teenage boy no less. Then she goes to kill the librarian as she is HAVING HER OWN AFFAIR because he is cheating. Also all her hate for her mother too.
Idk meticulously planning out how & where you should kill somebody and having multiple backups plans ready is also super psycho, the fact that he’s a tad less impulsive than Love doesn’t make him any less of a pyscho
I feel like he would've done the exact same thing
Did we watch the same show lol?
Joe and Love are just as bad as each other.
He killed Marianne’s ex husband though! So she definitely killed more but he wasn’t murder-free.
We’ve only seen the tip of the ice berg with Love, we barely saw her outside of Joe’s perspective of her. There was so much more to explore
I didn’t want him to get caught initially but lol I don’t wanna keep seeing the same thing happen .
Well damn lol.
This show makes me so angry cause he keeps getting away. I get so angry every time he escapes death
I feel the same way about his character like I did with Walter White. I'm hoping Joe has a similar ending to Walter as well.
wait huh? didn't the bartender call him nick when he was giving him his drink? or am i missing something lol
I mean he’s “dead” now though. No reason to think there’s an active trail on him
His murders have been very sloppy like when he left urine at peach place and in this season when he was cleaning up the  Natalie murder he wasn’t even wearing gloves . I just find it hard to believe he wouldn’t get caught up at all.
Same here

There were many good aspects but a lot of it was a mess and erased a lot of the good will it provided

Hope this makes sense lol
Joe says he longs to be truly accepted, but the reality is he doesn’t accept himself. So to have someone see the monster he is and be cool with it (and a monster themselves, mirroring the qualities he hates about himself) actually repulses him. So he’ll never find genuine love and forever keep searching
This almost wants me want to read the books and see how it goes from there.

S3 was written IIRC prior to when the third book was released, and the vibe I'm getting from people on this subreddit is there are some major differences between the book and show.
Yup I agree with all you said. Where would they go from here that makes it interesting 🤔?
I feel the same, I was actually expecting that. I am so disappointed, Love was my favorite character.
He was great on Animal Kingdom too he played a character you love to hate on that show.
I did not care for Marienne even in the slightest. I didn’t really like Beck either, but I cared more for Beck than Marienne
Weird the news would cover a murder suicide extensively and report her death if she lived...
I mean, at this point he basically becomes obsessed with any woman he comes into contact with (who isn't a friend of his current/ former obsession), so that would have totally checked out.
Oh yeah definitely I am the exact same way lmao. Being aware of your own bullshit but continuing to do it is an art at this point.
Do you think killing over 4 people in different states and being involved in 6+ murders is realistic without anyone connecting the dots? Lmao. It’s a TV show. I’m not worried about realism I’m upset about it becoming repetitive.
Lol right? Joe is deluded about himself and I feel like people have made the mistake of taking his delusional beliefs about his own behavior as mostly true, but they are very much not.
Psychiatric help wouldn’t do anything for a sociopath or psychopath. They would find a way to manipulate/use it to their advantage
This!!
It’s not only about him & Loves marriage problems. He also struggled with thinking Henry hated him and thought he was a monster, finally formed a bond with him, and then left him at some practically strangers doorstep? They really fucked up these character arcs for absolutely no reason. We see how messed up Joe has become because of his mother abandoning him & then he does the exact same thing to Henry. This series is starting to become super repetitive.
[deleted]
I always knew love was going to die. I just felt in my soul that Victoria was done with You. I think in the pandemic she did some more big films and shows and doesn’t want to be to stuck to a series so I think she didn’t sign to go on to season 4. Could be totally wrong but I felt from the beginning no way love was gonna live. Knowing there was a season 4 obviously joe would live. I wish they wouldn’t have said there would be a season 4 because Loves death was so predictable to me.
That would have made it so much more interesting. Him killing her was so predictable. Also the way they made her act this season was bad but she still made it look good . 
Unfortunately they just killed the best thing for the show
>Also kind of wish Joe had some kind of reaction to Theo. He went from hating Love, to loving her again, to hating, to loving (very emotionally volatile) to just being bored and then just wanting her gone. It felt jarring.

Joe's feelings towards Love were whiplash inducing this season with the way they seemed to abruptly change episode to episode. When Joe suddenly declared that he felt literally nothing towards Love around episode 7 it completely caught me off guard.

Like, what? I thought we just went through several episodes where you realized that you like elements of Love as a person and want to make the marriage work. Now you suddenly feel absolutely nothing for her and your only goal is to secretly leave? It came across to me as wildly inconsistent.
That’s the point though! He’s so beyond nuts and abusive. I loved the episodes where they were a power murder couple but completely get why the writers didn’t want that storyline to continue
Yeah exactly this season really went off tangentially and it kinda started unravelling and not in a fun to watch way….
In the third book, Love's parents pay Joe off to move away & never contact Love or the baby again. He moves to like Bainbridge Island or something. They give him enough money that he doesn't really have to work so he volunteers at the library & falls in love/obsession with a librarian. Turns out said librarian is married. Her husband is an ex-rock star in recovery. They have a teenage daughter, & the librarian has a a protective male best friend & a protective feminist female best friend. Joe is of course threatened by all of these people because he's an abusive stalker psychopath who must be the only person in his obsession's lives. He ultimately kills the female best friend & stages it to make it look like she ran off to Minnesota for a man & a new job. He tricks the husband into taking drugs again & he ODs. He discovers that the male best friend is fucking the daughter, so he kills the male best friend for being a pervert. Then, twistaroo, the daughter is like, great, we can finally be together, & it turns out she thought Joe had been pursuing her mom this whole time in order to get to HER. Joe is like, what, gross, no, & the daughter "accidentally" kills her mom. Joe is horrified that he attracted a murderer. The daughter gets off & goes away to college & Joe moves away to some other town to repeat his dumb cycle. FWIW, up until the daughter kills the mom, Joe seemed super-super-stoked with her. I think they even got married? So Joe's fundamental character is pretty different too. That said, if you asked me which is a greater artistic achievement, the show or the book, I'd say the show, & I'm only giving season 3 like four wolfsbane-impregnanted knife handles out of a possible ten. The books are NOT good, & they really degrade in quality as the series goes on.

So there were bits & pieces used for the show, but it was pretty minimal.
yeah I was pretty disappointed when >!Love got killed!<. I really liked her character and the dynamic between them.
It says at the end of the credits in the last episode “it’s official another season is coming”
I think it would’ve been better if it showed them finally deciding to separate mutually as they’re both practically about to kill each other. Would’ve been interesting in the future to see how they navigate that with jealousy and everything in that dynamic. Although I’m not sure if it didn’t happen how it did in the end how they’d get away with everything they did with the boxed people and the stair faller lol sorry idk how to block out spoilers so I just did it vaguely lol
They already announced season 4 :)
I kind of disagree. Love had gone from someone who was good at hiding her crazy to someone  really impulsive who just killed without a second thought which put her and Joe in danger. I do like Love but there was just nothing more they could do with the character so I think killing her was the right choice.
I hope there isnt another season i liked this ending. Its nicely wrapped up
It felt like in an anime when everyone has another trap and another trap but than... another... to cancel out each others moves..
Love hearing Taylor's songs in movies/on TV
I had a huge grin on my face when I recognised the intro. Some nice use for it.
and none of us really liked the ending 😂
Penn did what now?
I think it’s also that he’s always obsessed with protecting women and thinks of other men as obstacles.

The pacing was frenetic in season 2, slow in season 3(outside of time skips).  It works for some shows, but with Joe most of what’s interesting is the high stakes of every episode, he somehow gets into an impossible situation and then finesses himself out of it.  It means his inner monologue is more reactive than contemplative.  In season 3, everything is like a slow build up to a final confrontation, where stuff goes wrong but it’s more a lot of things gradually going wrong then ordered chaotic events.  Even their attempt at the Will/Benji thing with Gil/the neighbor gets tied into a bow for 90% of the season until it all comes out.  I (and I assume most of us) want to see Joe hiding in the shower while Beck comes in/Jasper cutting his finger off in a parking lot/hiding in Peach’s house type stuff rather than just tense conversations and a sense of foreboding for future episodes.
No question the season sags in the middle and picks up towards the end. Not unlike Season 2, honestly, which also slowed down quite a bit in the middle

Not a bad thing Imo, but it may be difficult for noncommittal viewers to stick through
and the ending was super underwhelming.
Yes they did a terrible job. No one likeable or interesting. Joe and Love couldn't carry the season by themselves.
Even the author has dropped in quality lately, book 3 was awful and a lot of people feel similarly.    
I think I'm beginning to accept this series would have been better if it didn't just continue in this endless loop.
Does love exists in the books? If so, does she die there as well?
IF THATS TRUE IM GOING TO CRY. Spoiler but why did it end in France… so random…………
Not with You pls… They already ruined Riverdale for me, I even adore the first season… now I’m just watching the show for the memes😭
When it got to the swinging scene, that felt like the old writers!! I was HOOKED. When they started to run I was like AHHHHHHHHH RUN (it was probably midnight by then)
There are drugs that can make people appear dead. What if the real plot twist is that she actually knew about his plan the entire time and switched out the poison in his syringe with one of those drugs that make your heart stop to make you seem dead. She then had her mom or someone waiting some where in the house with a body, for the fire, so people think she died and to wake her up.

The writers have reused stuff from other seasons, like the kid for him to be a father figure to (Paco and Ellie). So anything is possible, once again, I was just brainstorming. She is most likely dead, but it would be an interesting plot twist and have a much bigger impact than Candace not being dead. It would be pretty funny if the girl Joe spends the entire season 4 creeping on is just randomly murdered by Love at the end of the season.
agreed about thinking people were dead. gil, sherry, carey, theo…thought they were all dead and then next scene they’ve woken up lol
Yeah and I think it was foreshadowing that Love and Joe didn’t trust each other to not have back up plans with the cage. I know Loves key helped get the Conrad’s out of the cage but if that was the writers plan for how they escape then only Joes key would have sufficed. There was a reason they had them BOTH hide keys in the cage.

ALSO I think there’s a reason Love was nervous and extremely against Joe going to check on Henry when he got home. I think we’ll see why in S4 if love is alive. 

TLDR: Love and Joe never trusted each other i.e keeping spare keys in the cage, so Love was prepared for her wolfsbane.
Interesting though that there was never any mention of Love's corpse in the article Matthew was reading nor in Joe's monologue. The only explicit mention of a body/body parts were the two toes he had cut off, everything else was "charred remains" which could pretty much refer to anything that was burned.
No after she died Joe still had to write the email, cook the pot pie, cut off his toes and give himself first aid. I still think she’s dead, but she was laying on the floor for a while before the house got burned down.
At the same time it showed that the fire alarm rung before the fire got to Love. I think either her mom/her had set up lawyers to keep her pretense of being dead while she goes into hiding.  Also Joe is super bad at making sure people are dead lol ie: Candace.
Hi please don't push shitty stigmas on people with BPD, it's extremely harmful in getting them the proper care they need. As someone with BPD and no violent tendencies towards other people, it's annoying being compared to a literal murdering psychopath because I was also neglected as a child!
Yeah, I think the reason it’s so hard to see this arc is because Joe is the narrator, so it just makes Love look even crazier (which is the whole point lmao) but objectively it makes sense.
Excellent point! Joe had a bit more respect for her In season 2 and by the end of season 3 we really get to see how much he detest her.
While love is obviously a bad person I kinda wish she’d be here for another season. Joe deserves all the hell they gave one another. I think their relationship breakdown should’ve been more slow burned. The unnecessary killings felt super rushed at some points.
>!But how'd the AI not pick it up? It nearly had 90% accuracy ATT, meaning it could've pinned down Joe at like 40%. Not being super uptight, but also how did a server's worth of clips get into Theo's flash drive?!<
I think I liked S1 the most. Unlike the majority I liked the flawed like everyone heroine a millennial type her friends her life. (Beck being considering bad compared to Joe and Love is crazy)
>The fact that Joe is even more sympathetic now is frankly alarming. She literally makes him look like a kitten.


Joe stans really are weird. His whole motivation is "I want to be a better person, I don't want to do bad things anymore" and "this person is evil therefore it is fine to hurt/kill them" are entirely incompatible. Evil people will always exist therefore Joe will always have someone who he wants to hurt or kill, which makes him an actual time bomb. 


Both Joe and Love are extremely selfish in thinking they deserve to be with someone else after the extremely messed up things they have done in the past, but the difference is Love is at least semi-realistic in wanting someone who's morals are no different to hers, hence why she without much thought tried to kill Theo for the sake of Joe. Joe seeks decent people like Marienne, Beck, Love (when she seemed that way at the beginning) and Candace. Even if he got his happy ending with Marienne, it would mean nothing since his toxic past would inevitably catch up with him, as it has multiple times already. That's not only unrealistic, its just plain selfish for the good people he has gotten with.


>He enables her murderous tendencies where Forty sort of… dissuaded them, in a sense.


When was Forty dissuading her from murdering people? As far as we know, she's killed 4 people when Forty was alive, and Forty only suspected her of one of those kills, being the childhood girlfriend. Outside of that they were just co-dependent twins, so not sure where you got this dynamic of Forty stopping Love from being a psycho murderer.
It is absurd, and it’s going to be interesting to see how he avoids being recognised in S4 after being cooked in a pie! His face would have been everywhere and Paris is filled with Americans.
This dude Joe got away with three media covered murders: Beck, Hendy, Love.
That’s a good point, I would have to go back to be sure. It might’ve felt like more because it was such a small community compared to NYC or LA. 

Counting Gil and the final kill, there’s 4 between them. But the attempted murders would bring the count to 7 for this season. Plus a burnt down winery!
Four if you count Gil. Although they didn’t kill him, directly.
I get the impulse but people in this show can afford to tip like 100% and it isn't an issue for them. But, also, I feel that there MIGHT be a bit of product placement going on :/
80% cut
I assume the death of their son put a lot of stress on the relationship and the wife’s sobriety
agreed, I really hated the moment I saw them starting to move towards that direction. I wish they stayed w her being completely loyal/obsessed bc that’s what made love, love. Would’ve appreciated Theo turning more into a replacement for Forty rather than an affair as she had said that he reminds her of her brother.
Lol I found out prematurely from a poll about who to bring back from the dead and saw Love’s name
He looked after Paco...
Marianne and Joe had zero chemistry. Joe had more chemistry with the neighbor. Almost wish Marianne was killed first and Natasha was in the show more. This season was pretty disappointing and hard to believe that Joe “loved” Marianne so much he would blow up his life and move to Paris for her. Kind of wish Love lived and season 4 could be about her
I think she was the excuse that gets the show out of "the purgatory that is suburbia" 🙄 after they realized they were renewed for another season
I think it's her acting and chemistry. They don't click hence we can't see the connection
I agree. With Beck Joe clicked and they have lots of chemistry and were alike (pseudo) intellectuals. With Love as well. But Marianne wasn't even well acted.
I think it's because of Joe's character.. you know he's in the serial killer state of mind the obsessions with anyone who even got him in the slightest was coming off really strong
Oh I completely bought it on Joe’s part. Marianne’s not so much.
Bro you wild, Marienne literally the best part of the show
Have to agree. Not done with it yet but I’m on the verge of giving up cos honestly Love’s character development is just getting from bad to worse. From the moment she axed Natalie and made Joe clean up her mess, whacked Gil in the head, judged Joe for cheating on her when she basically did the same with Theo, and not taking any accountability at all?! I’m pretty done with her 😅 Joe isn’t any better but they honestly could’ve done better with Love’s development
Yes she absolutely did! I was happy to see her go tbh with you. They painted an impulsive, impractical and insane picture of her in this season.
I burst out laughing I want to make the screenshot of that with the subtitles my Twitter header 😂
It has always been toeing the line but this seasons jumped off miles away from that damn line lol
Agreed and that applies to a lot of shows so I don’t understand why people complain when things become unrealistic. It’s called fiction for a reason but they could have at least steeped it in some logical aspects
I didn’t even notice it until season two, but this season it was way more distracting to me for some reason.
Yes! That and when he put on Natalies coat but literally all of his black chest hair was out had me rolling
Yes I was trying not to come off too “feminist” in my attacks on how they choose to make her the stereotype of an unhinged heartbroken woman. I literally hated everything about what they did to Loves character especially since I’ve always felt that she had more potential developmentally than Joe did. I never liked Joe but  Jesus I’m just over the show at this point. I feel as though we can only go so far with his character especially since he managed to choose his obsession with Marianne over his own son. I thought he was going to have an entire character change especially when he was becoming aware of his patterns but Jesus they made him “YOU” Marianne 🙄. I was like yup im over it all.
[deleted]
Same, really enjoyed seeing love be love and not the projected version that joe had about love when he was fixated and obsessing. And she called him out on all of his behavior and of course he’s the hero of his own story so he justified his behavior while vilifying hers. Was bummed to know that she died :( was hoping she could’ve lived and that this was the last season
Lmao the whole show is about him everyone else are just side characters, if he dies the series ends

I wish this trope would die so hard
I want her to be alive so bad. She was part of this show's soul
She’s not a writer
Yes he really was doing the best for his child
I think he would have. Infact it is questionable if he would have even gone after Natalie or Marienne
Lol fans here have had the most outlandish impressions about certain scenes but it is a show about crazy people
Watching joe kill his partner and then start over fresh in a new city is played out. Love made it exciting.
Ikr! I would much rather have watched two psychos trying to kill each other while simultaneously trying to work on their marriage rather than another season of "teehee my pp wants this girl now"
They need separate therapy and couples therapy. In my opinion
:(
Exactly
Really shows that some men aren’t made for monogamy and just end up hurting every woman they come in contact with. I just hope he has a realization or gets caught
He's not looking for what love is though? The whole point is he won't find anyone
He stopped feeling for love when he found out she was a murderer? How can people not understand basic story telling
Yes. I completely agree.
They wouldn’t find a body in a house thats completely on fire like the way it was. Plus, her body would be close to where the fire was started so they could assume her body burned to ashes. 

She could very well be dead but if they want to give Season 4 a chance, they should find some way to keep her alive
[deleted]
but his name is nick
I don’t think we can link it but you can look it up. “the laterals” is the interviewer
Theo just made me cringe every time he's on screen. It took him getting beat with a fire extinguisher to actually feel somewhat sorry for him.
I thought my girl Marianne was way smarter than to love JOE of all people. Like she fought so hard to get her shit together, be a good mom, present her case to the court etc etc. So yeah, I can see the stress of the trial and all the emotional exhaustion of always having to be the best so your shitty ex doesn't use your behavior against you in court, I can see that leading to a fling but like loving Joe? Man 😔 

Cary's fun bag is def the ultimate deus ex machina and joes luck is unlimited it seems
Good point, but maybe Theo is his middle name and he prefers to go by that instead of Jacob
Joe’s half brother he gets a quick glimpse of with his mum. They do look pretty similar
So? They could get one.
He's an attractive white male with a great voice.

Replace the actor with a fat, monibrowed balding indian and see if the fans still love the character.
Because he is fantastic. I absolutely adore Joe's character.
Not trying to be a dick but is it just me are her drawings absolutely shit? Lol there’s no freaking way that would win a major contest a 10 year old could draw at the same skill as her
I highly doubt Paco or Ellie had the idea to gain international residence and fly out to the literal population hub of France.
No the drugs stopped her heart.
IM FUCKING SCREAMING AHAHHAAH I GOT IT SO WRONG AND IK I HAD IT WRONG PLS 😭😭
Yeah because killing someone is someone else’s fault lol
That’s literally victim blaming lol, Joe got trapped in the marriage by worrying about the baby
you can say that but at the same time love knows who she married. Joe is a sociopath bro and they are known to not maintain long relationships.
Thats why get better was in quotations 💀. I know hes not going to get better we literally hear his thoughts. Love didn’t just fuck some stuff up she killed more and before joe did.. they are both as terrible as the other. Love just annoys the hell out of me
Just have joe be in Paris and overhear some American tourist talk about the murder cases in madre Linda Like 

“You hear about that dude whose wife baked him into a pie in Cali?”

“Oh yeah The Quinn girl from that rich ass family? That’s crazy bro. She probably killed her brother too.”

*joe smiles and has some narration quip about how truth gets distorted*

“Yeah man. Pray for California bro. Nothing wrong with them, they just ain’t find her body yet. Crazy bitch still on the loose somewhere”

Then have joe go into a crazy research spree to find out how the fuck that happened.
the sudden shifts in personality/motive gave me whiplash, like joe going from natalie back to love to marienne to love to marienne lol
Only watching if Victoria comes back
I bought his age.
Exile came out when I was going through the end of my ex and I trying to get back together, so it really hit me when that song played in the show
Lool !!
Never gonna happen 🤣🤣
yeah but he just happened to know to grab the pills, then also just magically knew to take them while love stepped out, and he also just miraculously gained his motor skills back all at the same time when it mattered the most. 

like yes science wise that's what adrenaline would do, but story wise, Joe is buried in plot armor.
Beck was never malicious as much as she was negligent and self absorbed, which covers most people. I liked her a lot and appreciated that she was flawed in a not overtly villainous way. Peach was the one who got their hands dirty on the Beck side. Beck hurt others by being your average 20-something woman. I agree that she was very realistic, and I think a lot of people were hypersensitive to that because they've had to deal with the many oblivious Becks of the world.
100% agreed. The story with Beck was so much better than the last couple seasons with Love IMO.
Super excited here too!
I don’t know, haven’t read the book. I just put a spoiler warning in case there was anyone scrolling through the thread that hadn’t fully finished the third season yet.
Opinions man.
Well it's really crazy that your argument is that Joe had to do everything perfectly if he didn't want Love to kill someone lmao. Even if her ex wasn't "faithful" she was ready to basically paralyze his body to make him stay with her forever? If that's ok with you just because she "didn't mean to kill him" then idk what to say lol. She would've killed Marianne even knowing she wasn't the problem. Only the child made her step back. 


And Love wasn't the perfect You for Joe because she wasn't someone he could save but instead he needed to save people from her.
I didn’t even notice that! It would’ve been so much more interesting and a better way to work with the characters I think. 

It felt like everyone’s potential was a bit wasted and they weren’t as fleshed out as the past seasons.
Just finished episode 2 and this season is definitely going to be a challenge for joe and love lmao I’m HOOKED
The ending I mean
THIS a million times…
I agree.  The stalking cycle needs to be done now.  We need something new
Haha felt the same way. Inherently everyone is self serving but love fucked up first compared to Joe and truly went out of control nuts at the end
Right?? and isn’t it sus that everywhere he goes there’s a murder??
She totally felt like an afterthought. Every other time his obsession began right away, but it just developed with Marianne out of nowhere over halfway through the season? I just don’t buy it. Oh well, I’ll probably  still watch season 4 but won’t be waiting with baited breath like I did for this one
No they don't have to end anything actually
I mean regardless, that’s still too old to be having sex with a teenager
Oh wow!! He looks so young
Nick is in Paris
In case you were still looking

oh definitely. my whole thought process was if by some chance they moved somewhere else in the states and some neighbor ever looked em up they would see the weird things that seemed to follow them around and get suspicious
He burned the house down with her inside.
Jump the shark
Well he let someone free on the account that the person moves away and gets a new identity I feel like that’s a glaring loose end that will catch up with Joe.
The whole season happens cause she can’t stop assaulting people and doing dumb shit lol
Right?! I mean I love the actress that plays Love, but it doesn’t change the fact that she went way off the rails. I totally agree that Joe is hypocritical and messed up but Love is also hypocritical and messed up and slightly more unhinged than Joe.
Oh yeah she is a horrible person too, I was just saying that she seems unstable and I felt sorry that Joe is being a hypocrite towards her. Love and Joe are meant for each other in a sick and twisted kind of way.
Book 3 is already out.
Yeah, I agree with that. As a guitar player, sometimes it's funny to see how little they did to get the actor prepared for a scene like that.

But knowing what comes out of those sprinkler heads makes that scene absolutely repulsive lol.

However, I suppose it's not the most important moment to break my suspension of disbelief considering a lot of the show required the viewer to just go with it. Found it to be a relatively poorly thought out season as a whole anyway.

It’s another Netflix show
I totally wouldn't have minded it going the whole way through, and quitting therapy and discovering you need to come back I'm sure would have been a totally relatable storyline
That was after he deals with Joe and learns for sure how terrible they are as ppl... Instead, he see a guy on the floor Gagged up, is worried, goes to help has the phone in his hand to call and then joe barely blinks and makes a noise and he knows all of a sudden not to call the cops? Absolutely ridiculous
You’re right!!
Ohhhh I vaguely remember that ty
Good catch
Dont have answers to your other questions, but their kids were away at summer camp. They mentioned it once when they started the lifestyle process, and then Sherry asked Love to send an email to them.
They answered the Conrad’s situation. Love went and posted on Sherry’s blog (as Sherry) that they’d found out their neighbor, Matthew (Theo’s dad), was spying on everyone in town and that the Conrad’s were furious and considering legal action and they were leaving town until it was corrected. Love even mentioned checking “them” into a b&b for appearances. Also…the kids were away at summer camp. Sherry asked Love to check in the camp and make sure they were okay since she checked in once a day.
Omg I thought it was my eyes. Literally kept rubbing them like well I’m either getting old or I’m tired.
I literally said above why I watched it. And I won’t watch any further
Or about a few scenes before confessing he killed someone as a kid and conveniently Ryan gets murdered right before he's leaving for Jersey.
Really I thought he looked older! I like the actor but he wasn’t a 19 year old looking impressionable guy.
[deleted]
This is why I’m confused. I feel they should have made her have more of lack of emotions toward her baby and be more about Joe. But they didn’t go in that direction.
Same, the only way season 4 will be interesting is if Will, Ellie, Paco show up.

Because right now I miss Love already and like you said season 4 won't be the same without her.
>!I also didn’t like that he went from an arrogant sort of sociology gender studies Chad surfer bro to a weak insecure simp with no alpha male traits.!<

>!At the beginning I was like oh Joe is fucked love is going to leave him for the guy, but then he was just like a cringe college kid with no friends character. How did he not have any friends in college like lmao!<
It’s funny bc the book is 180 different from this season, but one thing they didn’t change is completely murdering Love’s character arc

It’s also… it leaves a bad taste. Like why does Love have to be the “over the top psycho” and lonely boy gets to be the “good psycho.” Like even in fucking murder shows they gotta make the girl the crazier bitch of the 2
Ha you would get a kick out of book 3 compared to season 3. Love is barely in the book! They don’t get married or live together. Joe moves to suburbia alone after Love dumps him and basically tells him he can never come near them again. 

Oh but he doesn’t move to the rich suburbs, he moves to a small island off of Seattle. He does fall for a librarian… who’s 10 years older than him, and just a normal person with a teen daughter. Love does go off the deep end in the book too, but that’s a separate thing and reserves itself away from the main storyline with the new love interest. 

It sounds like it would be boring, and honestly I think maybe on screen it could be, but the ending was sooooo shocking, just a really intense ending that I did not expect at all. So just for that it’s worth the read.
I really like this direction.
Really ?? Sources
Oh Lord lol
Hakuna matata
Yes, it was better than season 2 but it was a similar formula until the very end where they made a brilliant move to make Love a killer. This season 3 seemed fresh and completely different from the others because of the suburban dynamics and the cheating aspect. The ending for season 3 could have been better, but it was still good and the buildup to the finale was great. Best season yet.
I liked it a lot until close to the end!
He is 19, I seen that part but it seems everyone was mad about her sleeping with a teen or some even said high school but dude is legal and in college. Definitely annoying character but he is 19, lol
Oh no just got to the measles
Thank you 😊
Not true bro , he didn’t even want to kill Delilah because he knew what that would do to Ellie , he’s not some serial murderer.. ok well he is but he’s not exactly evil on his method of doing so. Joe only kills people that he thinks would harm the people he loves , he doesn’t walk outside and look for another victim right after. Had love not killed Delilah she would’ve been out and alive and joe would have been happily ever after the end
Yes I just don’t know how she got away with it the last time like if he died from poison rather than cancer but I’m probably thinking too much into it
[removed]
Look at my dick.
I totally agree with you!! 
I said I didn’t really feel much for the Conrads before the big fight, but I’ll say when Sherry compared Joe to a “Cymbalta Commercial” I got really excited to see more of her fun one liners lol

She really cemented herself as a solod comedic relief character for me, and seeing her and Cary’s morbidly hilarious dynamic while in captivity made it a lot easier to stomach the rest of the horrible shit going on.
And i think you really hit the nail on the head about the season feeling like a lot of small, mostly unimportant plots being used to glue together the larger story.

  In my opinion, the season felt at it’s peak when it was trying something new. Seeing serial killer duo Joe and Love navigate doing heinous shit while trying not to get caught by the locals in a tight knit town was the reason I was so excited in the first place! Like I knew he wasn’t going to give up his stalking tendencies forever, but I was really having fun watching them interact with the Conrads and care about their son :’)
LA is in cali

&#x200B;

you mean LA to SF?
I'm sorry, but she is dead. I too was disappointed by her death and was still low key hoping Joe would change his mind because she is the mother of his child but as soon as he gave the kid away I knew it was over for her.
They should've died together and ended the show . Why did joe have to survive only caring about a character we watched grow for a few episodes? Kind of
I just wish she was more like season 2 Love she seemed so much nicer then
For real it happens so often.  At the end with the dad just wiggling their back door open.  Like yo you are serial killers.  protect yourself!
She just pissed me off the whole season.
aren’t we all
What’s the difference? I’m actually curious. By the time Love found it it was just a shirt with dried up blood stains
Yeah I was thinking that might happen as well but who knows since he said it was all over the news and whatnot. I really hope she didn't die
He actually wasnt wearing gloves lol,  look again
She also killed her first husband .. they’re the same, they fall in love, murder their once “loved ones” and then move on to the next unsuspecting victim
Yeah makes sense just interesting to think he never killed for her like the others
Did she go up stairs to check on henry? I thought she went into the kitchen to get something....
\>But with Love, I never got the draw.  


Yes, exactly! I'm glad she's gone.
I just don’t realistically see season 4 even being worth watching. Just a repeat of everything we’ve seen so far. The best thing they could do is keep Love alive and her go for revenge, but then they’re just repeating the whole Candace fiasco. I was really looking forward to this season and honestly I had to force myself to keep watching. It almost felt… rushed? But that’s funny because they had two years to release it.
Dr. Nicky is one of the stupidest written characters in television. Dude straight up accepts being wrongfully accused.
Yeah. I’ve never heard anyone I know call it “The Measles.” I’ve heard “The Mumps” (different infection tho), but never The Measles lol. I’ve only ever heard it used as “This person got measles when they were a kid” lol.
Omg it DOES make fun of them and I found myself cracking up many times this season. Mostly because I have experience with this demographic.
both dont exclude each other, do they?
lmao how in the world does Cary promote gender stereotypes
My problem with this take is that Love was only responding to the inability of Joe to be happy with her. Again, she took him exactly as he was at the end of season 2. She accepted him despite everything he had done. She actively committed crimes to directly facilitate them being together.

But Joe, of course, just had to fixate. None of what she did was without a context of Joe being a piece of shit. He fixates on the neighbor. She kills the neighbor. He withdraws from the relationship because Marienne. She seeks comfort in a kid who admires her. She wasn't right to do that, but she never would have if Joe just knew what he wanted. There's that scene where she tries to go down on Joe and he literally cannot get it up because he just choked the chicken to pictures of Marienne. That shit is poison to a relationship, and that's completely Joe's fault.

**None** of this stuff was her fault. She is wild, too, but she was wild in Joe's context--the situations he created with his greed. He had a great thing with her and he threw it away. Everything she did was a reaction to his inability to be happy in an objectively good life. Not a single negative thing appeared to be happening before he fixates on Natalie, and, yet, he still did.

I seriously hope the character gets offed. I will celebrate. Joe is a villain. If he can't be happy with Love--someone who absolutely knows who he is, then he can never be happy. He'll always fixate. He'll always kill. He'll get with his fixation, lose interest, kill more. Fixate on someone new. Kill more. Get with his fixation. Kill more. Fixate on someone new. Kill more. And on and on and on.

He's a fucking insatiable monster. There are no. redeeming. qualities. about Joe anymore. I still appreciate the show. I'll still watch the next season, but I fucking hate Joe. I want him to die. I hope he dies. He deserves to die. He's not Dexter. He's just a serial killer.
Its reddit who cares :P

Season 1 was great as a one off. Season 2 did enough to keep it fresh IMO, Season 3 at the start was doing the same. When it fell back into old habits with the Marienne plotline is what caused the quality to suffer imo
Lol yeah I judged way too early I guess
It's called "Flanderization". 

They took her from "she may have a few fun little quirks" to "she's an absolute full on murderous psycho"
I think you're completely right. Maybe this is the direction they meant to take her! I definitely am having a hard time liking her at all any more. I know they're both murderers but they had some qualities you couldn't help but like. Now she honestly just seems like a psycho. Nothing is rationalized with her, not even murder. She's just impulsive and too emotional. I think her mother has issues yes, but I also think her mother knows her and is right about her.
I was hoping, albeit naively, that there would be some post-partum depression storyline to explain the sudden mental 180 Love did. Unfortunately, there was not.
Well book 3 just came out in April and most of the opening credits have indicated being based off of "Hidden Bodies" which is book two.
the only one that is very fitting is missing white woman syndrome because attractive white women get killed on the show so obviously it would be a big deal on the news in their universe. A lot of the other stuff is forced.
oh i must have missed that
but still its strange that it would be obvious there is a keyhole on the inside of the cage so Love and Joe would probably have had a conversation about that and it would seem kinda weird that they would both separately hide keys and not bring that up to each other.
cary being gay was at least very predictable and gil killing himself was only predictable cos of the giant suicide warning at the start of the episode
Every time she open her mouth I was like 🙄🤡
Oh crap I totally forgot it happened before!
I disagree. Unvaccinated people are only a threat to themselves.
💯
True but paco had an ending he moved on to better , Ellie never got officially told what happen to her sister and we just suppose to believe she doesn’t care ? Or we can’t get an update
I think I’m biased by my love for Star Wars.. Theo reminds me of a young Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) and there is a lot of potential character development based on what happens to him. I think there’s potential in Theo turning to the dark side over his obsession with Love and >!seeking revenge for her death, especially if he’s a main character in the next season!<
I mean, they don’t lmao
Joe being unvaccinated went absolutely nowhere and the measles plot was forgotten about an episode later. I care bro
yeah the lady at childrens home
Measles to Covid
Hard disdisagree. I was expecting 40 to make a pass at Joe at some point in S2 because the actor couldn't stay in character even once and constantly looked like he wanted Joe. Aside from that, like I said, the actor couldn't stay in character, much less bring nuance to his role and it ruined every scene he was in. I really don't know what the casting director was hoping to accomplish by hiring him. He should have been given a non speaking small part at best.
She sucked too but she always did
In this political climate it is, my woke sister
I don't even think Theo would want to get revenge after being tricked and finding out Love's a psycho.
thats why this season has the highest critic rating and lowest audience score. right, because that isn't a sign of a woke show
you are living in a dream world buddy, keep taking the blue pill choosing to live a lie. have a look at any stats
And all of this suddenly makes it okay? Just because an actor’s older than their character doesn’t mean it makes it right lmao your logic went out the door
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna just bask in the glow of the "You" that was actually good, and not ruin it by watching shitty sequels.
So she was just counting on him taking the knife?
Oh ok. If that's the thing, then I retract my statements
Yes, I wanted it to work too but alas Love was too much of a loose cannon. She is heavily flawed and has no way to think past her emotions, whereas Joe is super methodical. When she legit screams she murdered Natalie... I also screamed lol.
Well I won’t get too deep in it, almost 3am where I live, but here’s the thing right, the ending of Last Season we basically learned that Love is everything Joe hated about himself (when he’s impulsive, having to kill, childhood trauma, Poot relations with parents, mentally/emotionally unstable, the only problem Joe doesn’t have is when killing becomes the last resort) which is why he really had no prob killing Love, but the finds out that she is pregnant and then finds his purpose for staying with Love, Love knew this already she knew Joe would’ve killed her if it wasn’t for Henry, so she’s already been steps ahead of Joe from the beginning, meanwhile throughout season 3 the show hints that Joe for the most part is a step ahead of Love, except for both if them having an affair part.

In the beginning is were we really start to see some foreshadowing and it’s basically when both Love and Joe hide the key, we see that they pretty much think the same exact way, except Joe is more calculative, and that they know who they’re dealing with and either if them could end up locked in that cage…trapped…and where just about everyone who ends up in there dies, but they both had a way to escape being the key, which can foreshadow that they both have a way of getting out when either of them gets too crazy. Now maybe the key represents the antidote we first know Joe hid a spare key, and then after we find out Love hid a spare key, (again in case if either if them end up in the situation of needing one) except neither of them knows it, which can foreshadow that BOTH had some sort of antidote but neither of them knew, nor us, and out of the the couple who was trapped it was also the woman who was more emotionally/mentally unstable and after she was slightly wounded she returned the favor making things much worse but then escapes by finding Love’d hidddn key, she represents Love who got hurt first but then made things much worse, and again the Key being the Antidote and she got her and her husband out just in time. 


Another is when that kid who Joe thought was dead but turned out to be alive, Joe clearly thought Love was dead for, but it could also very much be that Love was just as smart as Joe which she had proven to be and had back up antidote Joe didn’t know about (like the key) just in case if she got overpowered which wouldn’t have been shocking at all 

There’s much more and gets deeper but I feel that’s enough sorry for any spelling errors
Fr every time he came on screen I literally rolled my eyes like leave her alone 💀
Honestly it would have been rather a good ending if it stopped at Season 2. Having him in the married suburban life of assumed perfection but then that hint of him falling back into his ways. It to me would have been a great way to end it.

As you said the characters were all around weak and in a way very by the books. I miss Love's circle of friends especially the guru. They were unpredictable even in their normality and I got that they were portraying LAngels as chaotic individuals that surprised you.

Season 3 suburbia though we have the unhappy wives who want to cheat out of boredom and have their rat packs or the alpha male bbq husbands and baseball game dads.

We have had that in so many other shows that it seemed awkwardly ironic to see one of the Desperate Housewives show up at Matthews and not in a cute way.
There is a need for diversity in everything, if Joe fell for a third white girl, I’m sure Twitter would start feeling a type of way lol
i think she found someone else and was “starting all over” that’s what she kind of told him when he ran into her outside her house. :((
he will probably find a french girl to obsess over next tbh. in the last season they introduced natalie a little bit only for him to get bored and kill her off in the first episode
Yes there was connection. Are definitely are watching a wrong show mate
Ahhh shit i remember her saying now and him dropping the knife, i just thought she had used it to slice the chicken so i never made the connection!
I can’t say season 1 is weak because without it, seasons 2 or 3 wouldnt mean nearly as much without the background of Beck and whatshername. 

I just hate that the end of this season felt like another reset button and we have nothing gained from the previous seasons. I can’t imagine them topping Love and I wish they’d ended the series in my opinion. 

I lowkey wanted Joe to die this season lol.
Good to know, thought my tv was the culprit😅
I felt like the series had run its course and I don't know what they can do with the rest of it without me getting bored and not watching it.
Maybe, but a letter from Joe explaining what happened, then a letter from Love explaining her side seems odd. I mean I agree that Dante's letter was probably from Joe, but it doesn't really make sense.
Yea I meant she did way too much and caused the imbalance in their relationship
What do you think season could even possibly be about? Finding Marianne and living happily ever after?
Yep I totally forgot that lol
Ah I did not catch it! Thank you!!!
Maybe it isn’t as subtle as I thought! When I discussed it with other people while watching they didn’t seem to think I was right. Oh well
The spoiler thing
Hmmm, I didnt know that. It was still very odd to do. Putting it in the food was just nasty lmao.
Nice spot
These are the kind of details why i always seek a community once i come across a show i like
Fuck you that shit made my heart hurt :(
And if love = wolf...


lovesbane
Love is the one who chose the 'I wolf you' phrase, when she already had killed her first husband with wolfsbane. So my theory is she already had it in her mind that she loved Joe so much she would be willing to poison him with wolfsbane, just like her first husband, if he ever strayed from her. She likes the phrase 'I wolf you' because she knows her love is as toxic as wolfsbane, and has accepted that.
Good pick up.
Did anyone else notice that You, a Netflix show, uses wolfsbane as a method for murder and in the Netflix show, Ginny and Georgia, Georgia is Also suspected of growing Wolfsbane in, just like Love did, and Georgia is suspected of mixing it into her husbands drink to kill him. Is there some connection here or is it just lazy writing from Netflix?
Omg that’s so good
She's the one who grew it too, right?
Wow, that goes even deeper. Love suggested that phrase as an alternative to "I love you" in season 2 knowing full well that she had already "wolfed" James.
Kinda related but also not in season two when love and joe were just friends she said “what I’m hearing is that 2 adults both knowing the risks” etc and the “what I’m hearing is” was what the therapist said they should say it almost seems like that’s showing that it was a healthy relationship at that time and slowly turned to poison
Oh no! That makes it so (much) sad(der)!
I thought it was used for anxiety never realized it could paralyze lol..
I straight up thought it was going to be Henry
you’re probably right i don’t remember much from season 2 bc of how long ago it was
She was going to kill Joe after Marienne.
It was on the handle of the knife that Joe picked up when Love went to check on Henry. The handle had the wolfsbane and that’s how it got through his skin.
Although question I had related: So At the end Joe said he took the antidote ahead of time, but I’m guessing he was still paralyzed For some time? Seems crazy if he pretended to be paralyzed while Marian was there or with Matthew even .
I thought the same thing. Like why didn’t they even call her up or smth?
The we don't let the kids eat fruit line was hilarious, for so many reasons.
Ahaahahhahahahah I love this comment. I lived in LA for 4 years so I get it. Love how dramatic they made it
Spot on!
If you look at Joe as a character in a rom-com, yeah it's confusing. But Joe isn't a rom-com character, he's a man with a very fucked up childhood that left him with a mommy complex. He constantly picks his new fixation and goes in to "fix" their life because he's positive that he found the one. He's a broken, fucked up man.
I think he lost interest in her completely when she killed Delilah in Season 2; Love claiming that she was a liability. Will B. was as well, but Joe let him go, which begs the question, is Joe getting better? Are Joe and Love different types of sociopaths? I don't think he wants someone as dark as himself. Once his exes became more human (ie: Candace and Beck cheating on him), the fantasy vanishes.
I said the same thing after finishing. Like, season one, he killed Beck, but she was all wrong for him anyway, it could have ended there and it’d be fine. Season two, he ended up with Love and she was perfect for him so it could end there and it’d be fine. Season three, he had the perfect partner for him but he killed her off too which proves no one will ever be enough for him. And they want to do another season? About what?? We already know he won’t ever be happy with someone! If they stopped the show here it’d be great. I don’t want them to just keep putting out seasons if it will ruin the show :(
But I don't think Joe ever wanted someone similar to him. He always wants to think of himself as doing the right thing despite bad circumstances. 

He also seems to believe that he is capable of changing once he gets that true perfect love. Love embrasses her dark side. That turned him off right away. 

He needs to see himself as a romanticised saviour who kills because there is no other choice. So Love was never his soulmate (if we admit that he could have one he would not kill). Marianne seemed perfect to him because she seems to try hard to do the right thing despite difficult circumstances. That's his vision of romance.
100% agree.
i’ve got a few complaints
???
What, you never survived a hard hit on your head, rolled down the stairs, have your head and nose bleed out with a lot of blood and somehow still wake up?
I honest to God thought Theo was dead. He was smashed in the head by a fire cylinder, fell down a flight of stairs and was in a pool of blood. How the fuck did he survive without horrific brain injuries?
Definitely found that with Cary later on in the season. Dude got a rock to the skull, I thought he was gone for sure. Then I was wondering why they were dragging their dead neighbours all the way to the cage…

I sometimes wonder if it’s a thing Joe even thinks about when he’s hitting people over the head with something. Does he know for sure that the blow he’s delivering is a knockout type of blow or a murder type? Or does he just hit them and then his plan continues based around whether or not the person dies
It also operates on the movie logic system where a large rock to the skull just puts you peacefully to sleep for 30 mins to an hour
My exact thoughts
truly & now pushing cary really got me i thought he was gone but NOPE
I really thought Carrie died
Peach.
Hahahaha! Its so ridiculous, I'm surprised that even the brain dead are clinging on to hope for this show!!!
Judging by the upvotes, you might think this is a good thing!  Seriously, are we so desperate for a new season, that we will take this shit they're flinging? God that's depressing...
Purposefully.
Don't watch anime xD
Yeah when he hit benji I was amazed he was alive
She showed interest so fast I for sure thought she was undercover FBI and they were finally on to him
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING AND I WAS SO EXCITED
I kept having that theory in the back of my head too. That she was really undercover or something because it all seemed way too easy.
She was just horny
100% same
Yeah lmao Joe and a psychopath Natalie with Matthew's tech would be insane
I’d add that Joe romanticises his love interests to the extreme. He sees them as who he wants them to be rather then who they are, so now the Love’s mask is off we see her for who she really is rather then who Joe wants her to be. I know a lot of people didn’t like Beck because she wasn’t who Joe idealised her to be, but I think that was on purpose. Beck wasn’t supposed to “deserve” Joe’s attention she was just his latest fixation who he projected his ideals onto. Just like with Love when she fell off his pedestal and he could no longer pretend she was perfect he lost it.
Great point!
You’r right , season 3 is continuing to tell Loves story . The entire season felt based around her . I think having the good looking neighbor in the trailer that ultimately was killed by Love in the 1st episode really got people to want to tune in at launch since she was in the trailer . I should have known this was coming now that I think about it , I’m sure we all should have …. Pretty neighbor and Love being completely unhinged at the end of season 2 = death early on .
I think she was more composed because her family always cleaned after her in season 2.
I agree, I felt towards the end with her psychoticness she was far more in a way composed and aware of her intent. Yes they both kill for their possessiveness of each other’s loved ones, but she was a complete fucking idiot in season 3 making SMALL STUPID decisions that lead to DRASTIC events. And I really liked her character! Except when she would act like a fucking brat, hypocrite, and idiot!
Same here. The Actress who portrays her makes her such a Multi-Dimensional Beast of a Villain
🤣
Righttt!?!?
I highly doubt they added an entire scene of a show a month before it premiered. This MWWS has been a phenomenon for a long time
I'm not sure I agree that it's heavy-handed.  Yes, there's a difference in the way the media (and sometimes law enforcement) treats MWW and men/POC.  That's not new.  Popular local (white) news anchor vs. obscure WOC with addiction in her past in court -- who's going to win?  It's mentioned a couple of times, but I don't think it's constantly brought up, nor is it the "theme of the season", necessarily.
Yeah that was a little on the nose for my taste honestly. The anti-vax thing was pretty retarded too. I'm like "Why is this in a show about toxic relationships and crimes of passion? Oh yeah, Netflix."
but they don't even incorporate covid in this. big factor for unsolved homicides.
Yeah and how was he able to have that paralytic antitode with him.
That was her true self. Season 2 she had a facade up. I agree though it was very strange.
I actually found Love more.. stable in a way, than Joe? Joe was all over the place with his feelings for love. Especially in the end.
That’s how toxic relationships go tho… up and down
Exactly it was like so like so opera. Joe didn't want to be with her almost from the start and I wish they had better dynamic than this.
exactly. i was like “what is even happening?”. could not keep up with their add relationship. also Joe’s warp speed relationship with Marianne was so predictable. joe meets girl. joe projects all his fantasies and bs on said girl. they hook up and five seconds later they’re introducing their kids and Joe’s trying to leave love without apparently realizing he’s doing the exact same bs he always does albeit for one minute which is then apparently forgotten never to have his mommy issues addressed again. 

i thought the writers were trying to punk us or something but then i realized “nope this storyline is totally serious and not at all a satire or joke.” also it’s annoying how literally every murder gets wrapped up so neatly and never comes back on joe in any real way (and any plot holes like the pee jar or the fact that he’s been interviewed by the cops multiple times for multiple different disappearances/murders never come up again). i was already kinda over the show after last season but this one sealed it for me- i prob won’t watch any more seasons if it doesn’t get cancelled.
Welcome to the point.
real life is not black and white
Joe's love is obsessive, but fleeting.--- that's so accurate of his character. I kind of felt sorry for Love sometimes throughout
Also, post partum can increase mood disorders. I was so depressed and anxious post partum, I don’t recognize the person I was and how “crazy” I was
They were human, that’s why. The swinging couple “weren’t that great” because they’re like every human on the planet, fit with very specific character flaws. Not sure if y’all are looking for a all around perfect character to call likable or what but it wouldn’t be realistic
You didn’t like Marienne?
Reviews are rave? How? The show isn't even well written now. Exactly no likeable characters. In the past they always could find someone we cared for. This season none. Joe and Love couldn't carry the whole season unfortunately.
The husband in that couple was my favorite character. So happy they made it out.
I hated Joe so much this season. His wife just had a baby and is working hard on being a good wife. Joe is so obsessed with anyone but his wife; to the point of treating her like a hag who is trapping him. He makes her feel worthless, because she can sense he truly hates her. She wouldn't have snapped so many times if she didn't feel like her life was falling apart. Family is the most important thing to her and he knew that. Also, it was creepy that he was upset about having a son. How would he treat his daughter I wonder?
[deleted]
WHO GRAZED YOU!
Just finushed the last ep and holy fuck i loved that line
Was this show always this influenced by woke writers ? It became a bit annoying this season
Hahaha!!! I loved that moment too!!!!
I think the fact that they started confessing their love for each other towards the end made people like them. But let’s not forget everything that happened before that. Sherry implied that she should be the one to live and even shot her husband in the leg. She tried to use natalie’s disappearance to make it look like she cared deeply for her even though she continued talking shit about Natalie even after she died. She was a hypocrite and a horrible person.
The fact that they then capitalized on their experience really shows who they truly are to their core. 😂 those two were hilarious.
[deleted]
Which shows their cage therapy works 😂😂😂😂 those two 😂😂😂😂
His character was hilarious 😂
YES!!! I was looking on here for someone to specifically say this.

&#x200B;

It was ironic that they were so hated by Joe and Love because they seemed insincere and plastic, but I loved Sherry when she talked to Love about her marriage with Cary earlier on and how you have to push through because relationships are hard work. Her intelligence and authenticity showed through in that scene (and she was a stunning actress!!! Sooo good!)

&#x200B;

We were taken for a ride on the hate train, but when they were in the cage, their love was so flawed and perfect - they were an example of a couple who got each other and loved each other even when they were annoying each other. It showed us that the reason they were hated by Love and Joe wasn't so much that they were phony - but that they were real - and to sociopaths seeing that level of human is probably very uncomfortable. I was truly rooting for them and was SO happen knowing they were OK.
Same - I downright liked them by the end of it.  I enjoyed Sherry's take on why influencers do what they do, what the motivations are -- damned insightful!
They were so fake it was disturbing, but the cage made them finally abandon that abs be genuine. Personally that’s what made me start to like them
It’s because they were “Caged: A Radical Couple's Therapy Technique.” There was a Ted Talk
Same. I think being in the cage brought out their human, more vulnerable sides and they didn't have to be "on" for anyone. She even admitted to Love that her blog is bs.
I went from despising every second they were on to thoroughly enjoying every scene they were in. Could see them trapped in that cage for an entire season

Theo on the other hand...wish he was dead.
I think the show is really good at that - creating a character who is insufferable at the start, but you grow to like them and even root for them by the end. In season 1, it was Beck’s snobby colleague, the girl with the deep voice. In season 2, it was Forty. In season 3, Sherry and Cary.
Soooo trueee hahaha
oh yea i hated sherry for a while but after theo went off on her that one episode her character got better.
Yeah it was really hilarious. I was rooting for them to find the Key too
When Sherry and Joe were interrupted the way she reacted fucking killed me 😂😂
I hated her at first but she really redeemed herself in that dungeon.
Gonna miss Sherry mostly because of the actor killing it. Same as Peach.
My favourite was “there’s a key in here! these freaky bitches don’t trust each other”
Sherry and Cary were very enjoyable toward the end!
“If I eat like that I’ll start gaining weight, and next thing you know people will call me brave and I’ll start losing followers” 🙌🙌🙌

I’ll never forget when Amy Schumer did a standup about how she posed nude, and that the last thing she wanted to hear was that she was “brave” 😂 So true!!
I think the terrible one is s2 was Hendy
In this season at least I was thinking Love was supplying the money from her family, a trust and the bakery or something along those lines.
I think when it came to expenses he didn’t care If Love knew about them, it’s just assumed he used Love’s family money. But the hidden shit? I guess selling fake books who knows
[deleted]
Ya super confused and wished they talked about money more. Even Joe’s shitty apartment in S2 probs cost a decent amount too lol.
[deleted]
My guess was that the house and cars were paid in full buy loves parents before the divorce.
Also Marienne had a really nice little house, apparently in a very ritzy town, considering she was a librarian…
That apartment wasn’t rly nice, it was pretty small and cramped. Also I thought it was on the ues. I think he got money from mr Mooney
None of the finances make sense. No way Love could pay for that massive house on a bakery salary which wasn't even doing that well for most of the Season.

And even if the house was paid off, they have so many other expenses including a growing baby!
It's common for film characters to live way beyond their means in expensive apartments
*book store manager

I don't think he ever stopped they just stopped showing it
I just assumed she had money saved up from the family prior to shit going down.
he inherited the bookstore from the previous owner, who was also his adopted father. how do you think he has a dungeon in the bookstore's basement?
wait was his Brooklyn apartment nice? It looked so tiny and the building looked so old
You thought that was a nice apartment in Brooklyn?
I would think her parents bought the house for her before the divorce was final.
I think it implies that they are living off of Quinn family money. Love's mother said she couldn't pay Love's mortgage for the bakery, but she never said anything about not supporting her entirely. The bakery money and Joe's book money would be extra on top of this. Her family probably bought their house for her too - it's implied they're very wealthy so this wouldn't be unbelievable. Once her and her mum cut ties, it's entirely possible that she reached out to her dad for financial support.
Especially because there's literally no one ever there barring like 2 quick scenes LOL
Yeah, that didn’t add up to me either. Did anyone else notice that Love is the only employee at her bakery? Some of the scenes make the bakery look pretty packed. How does she manage her bakery??
basically Love's mom was taking care of them, Love was spoiled.

Also the bakery did not do well in the beginning, as nobody was in the store, but towards the end of the season people started to come.
[deleted]
I think Joe got promoted to "Librarian" (what he wrote on his letter of resignation) despite not having the credentials for it
I think the therapist asked Love how was her bakery doing and she said its fine or something like that. Joe chimed in and said that Love was being modest and her bakery was pretty successful.
I assumed a trust of some sort that Love had. But then he somehow went to Paris using money that he wouldn't have been able to access so who knows.
cinema sines
Oh me too. Every episode looking for some kind of clue for that. Never figured it out!
He created fake copies of rare books and sold them as if they were the original
huh? didnt you watch season 1?
It’s also explained in S1 that the dude he worked for in the library taught him how to create fakes of rare books, a skill he then uses in S2 to get money by selling it to a clueless LA bookstore.

So Joe not only steals rare books but he also passes off fakes as originals.
lol he stopped doing that midway through the season and poor ellie was just never mentioned again
I kept thinking this town was based off of Los Gatos!
Atherton too
he stopped doing that midway through the season and like so many other loose ends ellie is just never mentioned again
He never got to sell it, he had to give it back because Marienne noticed it was gone
Ikr the bakery should be bleeding any savings dry and I find it really hard to believe that Joe and Love, a couple with a newborn who previously took pride in their jobs, just thought nothing of both of them being stay at home parents when they moved to Madre Linda. Even the bakery wasnt a way for Love to make a living, she wasn't looking for a job, just a distraction.
No cus he faked his death
Scream
This show taught me to incorporate more Hakuna Matata into my life
It was Joe leaving Henry at Dantes door that did it for me. Found it incredibly hard to watch that scene
Lol are we the same person? I also binged it from 5pm to 3am and it was one hell of a ride
Bravo 👏👏👏👏
So do I just send my address ? 😛
Mostly?  Uh-oh…
Mine too. I told him that no matter how much I may drive him up the wall at times at least I’ve never oopsie killed someone and left the mess for him to clean up. So...yeah, he maybe needs to appreciate me just a wee bit more 😂
its uncanny how we are all living the same lives
same here
Oof, [we really are all living the same lives out here.](http://imgur.com/a/6YNnMUF)
Yep, 6:30 a.m. right here 🙋‍♀️
Okay but that’s why I’m here. Fresh off the binge.
SAME
He's boring and snobby and has no sense of humor too.
I think anyone attracted to Joe or Love’s character has issues. It’s weird there’s this weird competition between them now with viewers. They’re BOTH bad and should be locked up or dead.
I know what you mean and I usually have empathy for that feeling. But here she knew from the start of her marriage that it was doomed. She manipulated Joe in keeping her alive and in marrying her. While the first part is very much understandable, the last part is not. She wanted someone like her and kept holding on to Joe. But Joe didn't want someone like him. So all her rambling about being perfect and doing all the right things to keep him satisfied felt for for me. She just wanted him, in the same way Joe usually wants his romantic interests. That is too twisted for me to be empathetic.
Thank you! I was so annoyed watching the whole season because of this. I know the show has a lot of sexist tropes in it because Joe has an issue with women, but did they have to make Love so crazy and such a cliché of the hysterical woman? It put me off and I couldn't enjoy her character because of this. She keeps doing things he didn't ask for and expecting him either to be grateful or fix mistakes. She is a mix between a *nice girl* and an hysterical woman. She is unbearable.
It seems like her parents suspects a lot of things but don't want to confirm. They had suspicions over her husbands deaths too. Better not ask and be unsure than confirm your daughters a killer.
I think they thought forty did but also love never told forty in all those years he died thinking he was a murderer
Fully agreed. Sherry was also repurposed as a completely different character, to the point where it could've been someone else entirely and wouldn't have changed the plot at all.
the first part of the season was the best part

its a shame we lost that to revert to the same dynamic again
agree i would've loved a murder duo kinda thing for longer
The formula's getting old, but it makes sense given everything we know about Joe. He's fundamentally incapable of being anything other than a serial killer.
Yea halfway through the season i was CONVINCED that this was a top 3 netflix show for me. Then that changed...
Commenting on every post (especially as a verified user) would get him more attention, to be fair.
I ended up spoiling myself when i tried to figure out how I knew him (with a spoiler that ended up being mostly wrong, as this man is irrelevant to all the ending stuff, but spoiled Love's stuff) 

He was Bing Lee in the Lizzie Bennet Diaries for anyone else in that position.
I literally just finished the season like an hour ago, and I had to google to figure out who tf this “Brandon” character was.
Marienne is moving (which I guess doesn't make sense now that her husband's dead). She was planning on taking Joe with her before he "died".

You just gave me a great idea tho- imagine if season 4 shows Joe 10 years later moving back to that town and stalking Henry?? He'd end up killing a teacher who gives Henry a hard time or something lol
lmao no because its not even Sherri's, it's a random character (and i think the flash forward is only 4 months)
After episode 4, I think it was. After they framed the neighbor for killing Natalie. He only briefly mentions it in a voiceover, which I thought was a total cop out.
At the end there is a time jump probably around a year bc it shows a short clip of Henry playing in the sand with Dante and he is noticeably older than before love died
I missed it too!
Well tbf, she kept emphasizing "starting over" and I'm sure having her friends around would have made moving on from forty a lot harder
And the show is portrayed from Joe’s perspective. We see Love how Joe is seeing her, and she was you-can-do-no-wrong-let-me-save-you obsession last season.
Oh tell me all about it.

Beck found him at the Renaissance Festival too. The only difference is Ryan saw him and immediately became suspicious, Beck saw him too and decided it was JUST COINCIDENCE for like the 98th time. Not sure it made a difference at the end of the day because the show needed both of them to die so that Joe can walk a free man. It’s just not realistic Ryan didn’t call the cops despite Joe’s poor attempt at threatening Ryan with drugs. He could easily throw the whole stash in the time they wait for the cops to show up. And what credibility would Joe have that any cop would trust a stalker over a small town celebrity???? It was easily an open and closed case if Ryan so much as snapped pictures of Joe everytime he was stalking him. Or better yet hire a PI to do the job for him. Love isn’t the only person in the world with money to hire PIs lol.

In real life anyone in Ryan’s situation would have called the cops asap. As would Theo at the bakery, Theo’s Dad as soon as he found the footage, and especially Peach immediately after grazing Joe’s leg.
this comment 💀
Adderral junkie, that guy is probably sharp as
I wonder if Joe thinks he can be so easily invisible because he used to feel invisible as a child and now looks like an average man you wouldn't particularly notice. But the writers seriously have to find an alternative to the invisibility cap. We see you Joe!
Loved this comment 😂😂😂
>how many times do people really wanna watch the same thing in a different town

I ask myself the exact same thing. Joe and Love kill every single person of their entourage but no cop comes knocking on their door. Next season just send them the fbi I'd love to see Joe ending up in jail.
I could be wrong, but isn’t it only your big toe that causes you to lose your balance if it’s cut off? I have to look it up now because I completely forget. Lol
Oh man, this was my first thought when he first started stalking Marienne. I've spent my entire life between NYC and SF/NorCal so I know both areas intimately. I never thought much about Joe's stalking when he was in NYC (or even LA) but as soon as he put on that creeper-cap of his and sat posted out in his car I thought "there's no way he's not going to be noticed and mentally noted as a creep by at least a few people". Affluent Bay Area suburbs *are not* NYC. Nobody gives a single fuck what you're doing on the street in NYC but nice neighborhoods around Marin, Palo Alto, etc. are absolutely filled with busybody NIMBYs. And if you're in a community where everyone kind of knows each other—you better believe those people would love nothing more than to have an excuse to gossip about the "new creep" in the neighborhood.
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.
Here's a copy of 

###[Alice In Wonderland](https://snewd.com/ebooks/alices-adventures-in-wonderland/)

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)
Oh! You're so right, great catch (:
Randomly one of my friends from college posted the other day that it was his mom who did all the costumes for the Alice in wonderland scene! Here’s her insta. https://instagram.com/daniellelaunzel?utm_medium=copy_link
I 100% searched for those amazing jeans as well! Also loved that white off the shoulder top so much too. Even that solid black dress she wore to the retreat. Killed it.
The blue dress was specially made for the show. Doesn’t exist elsewhere, sadly.
Oh wow first time I've seen something positive about Beck haha
Nope, didn't say it was a worse crime. And I'm a woman by the way.

It's pretty simple...you make characters the most shallow, superficial, cruel, pathetic excuses for human beings for an entire season, and then decide to change their characters completely in the last episode. Didn't fool me, I was rooting for them to die. Those two represent everything that is wrong with society today and what is wrong with people who act like them- and people who act like them are about a million times more common than murderers.
he was a narc. either way they both made it
He was married to a "human being" like Sherry. That's everything I need to know about him to hate him.
OMG THANK YOU. I literally just binged all of season 2 and 3 and this season left such a sour taste in my mouth! There was such a great opportunity for progression of the narrative to something new and equally interesting, but now we seem to be back to square one. 

Also I ended up rallying behind Love much more than Joe by the end of this season so the ending was just sad.
Measles are a risk only if you’re around antivaxxers and their progeny. Rabbits, cattle, sheep all are potential carriers of some pretty obscure zoonotics but measles is a virus. Unless one is severely immunocomprimised during childhood, you can get an MMRV vaccine and not have to worry about measles and the sequelae. However, now, thanks to the self important idiots of America, who lack even a middling IQ or the smallest ability to think logically, now people have to worry about unvaccinated children.
Same I was thinking the same thing! But turns out they manage to get out of the situation alive (sort of)
You don't get measles from being in the cold rain
The measles thing felt totally relevant to me. A nod to covid, but it was already a problem before covid. 

I'm glad the show only mentioned covid being a thing and didnt try to force it on us at all. It's just not interesting, and better not to try. 

The measles subplot however, totally relevant and super funny especially given the context of covid. It was a totally relatable reason for Love to get homicidal again and the antivax parents, the dad particularly since he's main who we saw, had all the hallmarks of a real life antivaxxer, taking about how toxic vaccines are and how we don't know what's in them. Except that we do. Literally, every molecule. 

That subplot really worked for me and worked for the absurd humor this show has.
This show is one of the best right now with casting. I’m always impressed with the performances and how surprisingly they are.
At the end of the day they were innocents who didn’t deserve to die in the games of Love and Joe - even though they were less likable than both of them! It’s great that they persevered.
chekhov’s key
I thought he was gonna carbo-load on the flour and find the key lol
On that note, it's amazing how they built the cage to lock each other up to make the other side think more clearly in times of crisis, but it ended up as a prison for 3 of their victims instead.
frrr same here - once they broke into that fight with love n joe after they overheard that LOVE killed thingy, was the exact moment i fell in love w the two of them. was like damn they aren’t so ditsy afterall💀💀
I don't think you should be in this thread if you haven't seen it all haha, unless you want spoilers anyway
The answer to that is in the conclusion of the last episode. Very on par with Sherry's character is all I'll say.
It kind of works though because Sherry was trying to manipulate Love into murdering Joe. She probably just thinks her plan worked.
>!He made it seem like Love forced him to do it all.!<
The actress is soooo good at playing obnoxious characters you can't help but love. She was my favorite character in search party
They are this season’s Forty
Me too, cant believe I liked them at the end and was rooting for them
Im glad Im not the only one lol.
Why not both? 😁
Honestly, no. They were authentic with each other the whole time and had a great relationship that only became rocky when they were literally thrown in a cage and told to kill one of themselves, but still stayed strong and overcame it.
Oh my lord, saaame! I was rooting for them towards the end. Such a great addition to the series.
I know that would have been the end of the show but it would have been awesome and a completely unexpected. * sigh *
I didn’t want them to be murdered because they were swinging, i just still found them to be extremely annoying at that point and it was an opportunity for them to be murdered. It was similar to how I felt about Forty- went from hating him to him being one of my favorite characters. Sherry and Cary were super obnoxious for a while there but I obviously changed my mind.
It was very tastefully done, like OP described it. It just was. He was blind and that was that, kind of like how being gay in Schitt’s Creek wasn’t ever a thing, it just was. And that makes it a really positive environment. 

But the “is he cute” bit that Dante said to Marianne after he met Joe the first or second time had me dead. Absolutely hilarious
I didn't have my eyes exaxtly glued to the screen for the first several episodes - doing laundry and stuff while watching y'know. More listening and then watching when the music told me something important was happening. 

So then in one of the very last episodes I just happen to look up at the screen when he pulls his walking stick out and legitimately thought "what? Has he been blind this whole time?" Thats how much of a non-issue it was. 

And then I remembered a line from the beginning about the Dewey decimal system being in braille, so that finally clicked for me.
When Joe leaves Henry at their door in the last episode, I was like, "Uhhh Joe hurry up and run away before he sees you!"  before remembering that duh, Dante couldn't see him.

i didn’t realize he was blind either lmao
Also when Henry is left on his doorstep I thought for a minute he wouldn’t know he was there! But luckily he cooed.
Thanks for this! I had no idea, good to know my perception was flawed.
Bianca Lawson has been playing teenage roles for years and she’s 42
I always assumed Love was *supposed* to be older than the actress who plays her, though, even before she had a child.

I made this assumption because before she met Joe, she had already been married previously and gone to chef school, and her friends seemed like they could be late 20s early 30s. I knew Victoria Pedretti was--what? 23? 24?--at the time of Season 2 but I figured they were just having her play an older character.

At any rate, your point still stands--Hollywood has some offensive ideas about women and age.
wow he looks like he’s a teenager. it’s not just the face but his build too. that’s crazy although tbh i thought the actress who played love was older than 26. idk why i’m surprised hollywood has actresses playing the mothers of actors who are older than them or in the same age range. hollywood is so damn hard on women.. like how come we never see average looking or even women who are not conventionally attractive but there are ugly dude actors everywhere. they’re just getting around to allowing bigger women and older women but they’re still pretty.
Actually it probably was less awkward cause he’s actually her age
I realize this is old so You may know but they are a couple irl!
It’s the hoodie that makes him look 18 lol I’m in my early 20’s and still cannot understand why high schoolers wear hoodies 24/7 now
I’m in college and a lot of the 18/19 year old guys look like grown men in their 20s. So he doesn’t look too far off
[deleted]
Ikr. I used to teach 18 year olds and that guy would stand out like a sore thumb in my class.
He does kinda looks 18.
18-20
Im 23 and well aware of what 18 yr olds look likz
That's a spoiler for me, but you're lucky that movie looks terrible to me and I wasn't watching it anyways lol
I'm pretty sure it was the first 5 mins because that's how long I watched after realizing he ain't coming back 😂
Spoiler tag hun
Also Marty's partner in Ozark episode 1.
Growth? 🤣

He’s a narcissistic psychopath that will never change
Thats a great analysis. But initially If i remember correctly Joe didn't plan to kill Ryan but only to overdose him and was pushed to when he bad mouthed Marienne. U know what never mind that doesn't change a thing. At least Joe has only killed one in this season and I think that season 4 they might not make Joe kill anybody as some kind of redemption arc. I think the perfect way to do so is for Joe to sacrifice himself to save the one he loves and end the show there.
THIS. Just got into an argument with my girlfriend that Joe made no real development this season, and if anything I think he even regressed back to the end of season 1. Even if Joe is being more "considerate" with who he kills, he still has no accurate self image and thinks his ways are completely fine. We saw Joe struggle falling back into old ways when he was trying to avoid stalking Marienne.....and then he went back to his old ways and we got season 1 and 2 Joe. Then Love brought marienne to Joe to show him that no one "normal" could ever love him or accept him, and he STILL doesn't get he message. It seems like all Joe cares about now is stalking Marienne and finding "you" when his previous prerogative was to become a better man to deserve his partner. Now he's just saying screw it he's aware of his flaws and is ignoring them just so that he can find Marienne. The writers which had been doing a phenomenal point up the season 3 finale, imo really dropped the ball. 

Not to mention now we have Joe completely abandoning Henry and the father/family role..... It just feels like the last 2 seasons have gone to waste. Joe accepted this life isn't for him so he's leaving. Instead of fighting for it, he's jumping ship to find a better situation. I no longer care for Joe and in a funny enough way am rooting against him. As cheap and possibly cliche it could be, I hope love somehow survived and makes her way back onto the show because at this point that may be the only way I can get excited about next season.
This!!
I totally agree, but I think the Love was the real issue with Joe’s backslide in season 3. She is the reason he had to get involved with Natalie’s body. He slipped back into his pattern after that incident and she got him involved with Theo, Sherry, and Cary.
You forgot about Henderson!
Yeah I thought the same thing. Ryan deserved to die imo
I’m sorry but was Love not a crazy villain?
It would have been very interesting had Joe and Love remained a team and gone psycho together
They are both Israeli like me😂 I guess we look alike
She was in Man of Steel. Superman's mom on Krypton

Another interesting connection
It’s an Israeli show so yes I’ve seen it(: absolutely banging
Always meant to watch that, I was really charmed with her as Vanessa and even more so here
That's why i shouldn't answer questions when half asleep. I read Daredevil as Deadpool. Ha!
Yeah, the imagined scene of love and forty in the bath was 🤮
annoying and looks like an actual pickle
sure! got any recommendations?
Yeah it's really annoying, btw are you talking about haunting of hill house and bly manorm
Yeah it was as if Joe had finally met his match when he met love so I was really excited to see where they'd go with the plot. Now she's dead so he's just gonna be back on the bullshit again.
By the end I wanted love to kill Joe and take over his inner monologue… I kept hoping she isn’t actually dead lol
Horny jail
Killed off the best character
Not sure if you still feel the same way, but I just finished the season and I'm in the same boat as you. Extremely disappointed and not as excited for season 4 as I would he hoping for.
She had it coming. Her days were numbered. She killed so impulsively without even thinking of the consequences or the trail  being left behind. Constantly expecting someone else to clean it up.
Underwhelmed
Ummmm........

*scratches head

Yea, that murderer is such a bad guy
If anything I would say Joe keeps these attachments to feel better about himself/his actions. "How can I be a monster when I'm so nice to these kids?" he probably thinks. Meanwhile they all literally end up scarred, lives ruined by choices he makes and he completely forgets about them the instant it's not convenient.
I agree. He constantly just pissed me off this season
Yea joe is joe but this season everything that made him charming was just gone 

If marieanne is the main love obsession next season I don’t think I will watch I hate her character so much
In this season only lol?
They should just do a short little 3-4 episode alternate season 3 where love kills Natalie joe helps her clean it up shit goes back to “normal” and boom the series ends id be the most content with that
season 4 better be the ending and an absolutely fantastic one at that because a lot of the time whenever something is good the next iteration is incrementally more and more likely to crash and it’s sad it kinda happened here
Mostly because it came in almost at the tail end of the season already. I thought after Natalie, they would climax with a showdown between Love and him. Then all of a sudden, they introduced a new story arc that I felt the show could have made do without. I was more interested with seeing more of the Conrads towards the end really than another new obsession from Joe.
The camping scenes were what really made me think "this guys a dick" tbh. Some real toxic masculinity there.
I DIED at that part, laughed so hard.
I didn't think it was weird that I understood everything he said until it was immediately translated for everyone else.
Joe was probably stealing rare books from the library during the whole season and replacing them with fakes.

I think there’s a scene at one point in the season where Marianne is telling him he’s not supposed to bring rare books home or something.
They have the best PI in the world but don’t send him after a kid…. I think he just made excuses to make himself out at the protector and hero, like he ALWAYS does… We do have an unreliable narrator in his thought narration.
I mean also what about Paco! Joe has been pulling this since season 1. He forgets everyone and everything when he has a new obsession. We didn’t hear too much about Henry in the second half of this season either, and that’s his own damn son lol
I mean y'all are forgetting about paco.. he took care of him and he was what 8 years old? the whole boy baby thing was dumb
this implies his own recognition of the pattern. that he attaches heavily onto females. i think this also correlates to him addressing his mommy issues in S3.
Not like that…
I never bought that the cage was soundproof in Season 2. Since when are those public storage places soundproof anyways?
Could you imagine how much it would cost??
>Coz they built together it like an Ikea bookshelf. 

🤣
im talking about james and loves relationship which seemed pretty sweet and non-murdery in season 2...
Had to add I thought Love looked like Joes mom, and him having mommy issues etc and her being codependent with her brother being mirrored in more ways than one
The Heathers reboot is the best show no one has seen.
Oh snap I didn’t think of that. And you know what, I think the text she sent right before he shows up was her saying that he should’ve eaten her in the womb
I would never hug any of my siblings while naked. No matter how close we were.
*The Raynes of Castemere plays softly in the background*
I'm a twin and can verify it was indeed very weird.
really made me appreciate forty. i didn’t like him that much until now. that scene was so sweet and made me miss the other half of love (forty) that brought out such a lively, loving side of her. i feel like it’s definitely a factor to why love was “sadder” this season, as joe states many times when “her side that he fell in love with” comes out in a few scenes. i miss forty.
Bruh, no offense but what makes YOU think Joe can care for anyone anyways? He gets bored with his victims, kills them, then moves on. How in the literal fuck is that going to be interesting in season 4 when the same fucking plot points have been used for every season so far?
Lol, because she was an entertaining character on a television show … 🤷🏼‍♀️
Maybe you should give TV a rest for a while?
Yeah, I feel like everyone is ignoring the fact that Love had Joe paralyzed and was sharpening a big ol' knife ready to kill him. It was very much kill or be killed, and Joe is the protagonist after all.
can you spoil me on how Love is in the book? 😶
>why was that necessary? 

She is notoriously impulsive and unstable...
She was an airhead as soon as she entered the show.  Her being peer pressured and influenced easily by people has been in her character the entire time
No one is more boring than lame twit Beck
Which new girl?
I agree, all I could see was an actress playing a part because of the way she always spoke so softly. I didn’t see her as the character and it took me out of the show. Real people don’t speak like that.
She was unconscious
Indeed. Towards the end, while Love was certainly acting psychotic, it wasn't necessarily ruining her character - except maybe about the reveal that she ended up getting rid of James accidentally. Prior to going into the season, I was truthfully expecting Love's character to go. If anything, her surviving at all would've been surprising. So when it actually happened, I was naturally bummed due to the limitless potential the show had with her character being gone...but it was more than that. If the show had a way to evolve like how Season 1 did into 2 (minor), or how 2 did into 3 (much more significant), then I might've been more accepting of the writers' decision to get rid of the character. It feels as if the show wants longevity due to the ending it gave us...thing is, I'm not even sure how many years this show has left.
Sherry + Cary were in Season 3 what Forty was in Season 2. You begin the season finding them amusing but not liking them, and by the end of the season you love them.   


I can't necessarily say the writing was lazy or sloppy...but it definitely felt as if the initial creative juices somehow got depleted. Who knows, maybe the writers felt like if they gave us too much of the Joe/Love chaos, that we as an audience would lose interest and get bored. Truthfully, I don't think we got enough of it at all. I think I'd even be more tolerable of Love's death had the whole season been like the first 4 episodes. Because the show feels as if it's refusing to evolve, Joe's character is now indeed just annoying at this point; I agree. 

&#x200B;

I won't be watching Season 4 unless enough people who have seen it can verify that it would be worth the time to watch, or if it ends up being the final season. Though, I'll still be reading the books, and look forward to Book 4 (read a preview of it last weekend, and it seems wild).
Like three seasons of him finding new girls to obsess over isn't boring?
I second AAALL of this.
I hope they change it up more too, maybe actually try and make joe act differently than he's been instead of killing every person attached to his obsession like before 🤷‍♀️ but knowing Netflix's track record you're probably right
What show are you watching? They're in California...
You say that like the writers are stupid (which they kinda are for killing off love)
It is tagged!
I’ve already forgotten a lot of season 1 and 2 but I felt like the killings were more abundant in season 3. I binged the whole season in a day, so this definitely contributed, but towards the end the killings didn’t even phase me anymore.
This is a good theory! Satisfactory ending!!
I loled at “Password is something ridiculously easy like HOTDOG”
Yeah that was really off-putting. He finally became self aware and I thought we were going to see a shift, but he simply gave into the urge and never brought it up again. While he's psychotic, I feel like Joe is too logical to have simply "moved on" from such an opening revelation about himself. I would have liked to see this explored more at the very least
And that is what is very realistic. Emotions aren't about intelligence. You have smart and rational people who have a messy emotional life. Joe's childhoold messed him. His hopes and obsessions (not the murders) in the show are realistic considering the situation. He expects love to save him. He also wants to replay the dynamic of saving the woman/his mother and getting the love that will make him feel normal. He is stuck in his head as this little boy who got abandoned. Psychology is messy
Yeah he was relying too much on the facial recognition thing and not actually using his brain.
[deleted]
I’ll never get sick of it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Agreed!
Yeah she was super unhinged this season, it didn’t bother me too much though! I was loving the rage and chaos as a foil to Joe’s methodological MO.
I’m on mobile, I don’t have a computer. It just shows up as spoilers on your comment, but thank you!
I think she was this season because Joe’s pattern is depressing. 3rd time is not charming let’s put a new psycho dynamic up front
I agree, they could've also maybe made Natalie and Matthew the new antagonists and Joe and Love could've been investigators of sorts. I'm only on ep 4 and I'm already over it.
I don't get this line of reasoning? Joe is always obsessed with someone. He doesn't actually love any of the people he obsesses over saving. Love just killed Natalie so Joe didn't have time to fixate on her but he would eventually have killed her too like he did Beck when they inevitably reject him for the creepy murderer he is.
Oh strange I pegged Marianne as the real obsession on episode one. Come on she’s a librarian.
Yeah the start of the season was really strong and it seemed like it was setting up exciting story lines. It all just kinda fell apart mid season, and the end was honestly just bad.
>And they made Joe so unlikeable that I don’t know if his character can be redeemed

From what I gathered from interviews the actors and writers were surprised ppl came to like Joe as they were under the impression he's irredeemable, for them they want to milk the toxic drama and push other agendas into this and if you compare shows from 1990's - 2021 you'll notice a shift in narrative and writing slowly somewhere along the lines as the producers and publishers stopped giving a damn about trying making a good story hence why original stories are so rare  , it was all to gain viewers while pushing a narrative and not a good story packaged with a message, as they missed that ship long ago in S2.
You’ve said Love has BPD in multiple threads. This is honestly a jump as she & Joe are not real,  not to mention beyond harmful to those who actually have it for people to have that mindset. Do you think all people with BPD or any Personality disorder become murderers? Most people with mental health issues and personality disorders aren’t serial killers. Stop diagnosing fictional villains. Also maybe stop presuming people with a specific diagnose are to blame for those actions when there isn’t any mention of it canonically. This trend of diagnosing fictitious people is so disturbing and gross.
She just keeps on killing and killing and acts as if it’s bonding activity with Joe after each time.. then she got so out of control in the end it’s so unbearable to watch. I mean Love’s mom is surely annoying but she’s right Love is only loyal to herself she will kill anyone without exception.
Love killed Delilah because she found out that Joe was a psychotic murderer and was going to turn him in the second she got out of the cage. She was protecting her little family in the making (not that it makes it any better). Same reason she killed Candace.
I would disagree. 

She didn't kill Delilah because she was jealous, she killed Delilah because it was the only way to make sure she didn't turn Joe in.
If he genuinely wanted to protect his kid he would've realized that he's the problem. But no...
What were the hints in season 2? I must have missed them
We can argue that Love attempted to kill Gil and Theo, and was open to the idea of killing Shery and Cary. Meanwhile Joe seemed conflicted and refused to finished her job with Theo or Gil. But yes, they are both serial killers I would not want to cross path with.
This is a fair point, but Natalie wasn't imposing any actual danger on Joe or her family. Joe rejected her and Natalie was okay with that. Ryan was a misogynistic junkie who was abusive to the ex wife and trying to blackmail her, distributing her nudes so that the court takes his side on keeping her child from her for the sole purpose of him 'owning' her. He knew that as long as he had their child in his custody she had to put up with him. It was cruel and he treated their child like shit. Natalie wasn't a saint either (adultery) but she was more or less a bored/neglected house wife looking for some fun. Which is wrong, but you can't really compare Love killing Natalie to Joe killing Ryan. Yes Joe had a knife but it was never known for sure whether he just wanted to intimidate Ryan or actually murder him. However, once Ryan assaults Joe and makes a comment about his ex wife than Joe loses control and pushed him over the ledge. I'm not saying Joe is a righteous person or anything but I feel like I watched a different show than you guys.
that is a fair point. I wasn't basing my statement on conjecture though. As I said, Joe is not a hero. I wanted to see both Love and Joe face justice for their crimes. In season 3, based on what ACTUALLY happened, I find it surprising that Joe is considered to be the source of all the problems. Joe does get obsessed way to easily 100%. Love was just worse. I think a lot of people just associate Love as being a woman and therefore not as dangerous as Joe. Also, most serial killers are men. People form subconscious associations based on what is familiar to them and their perception of the world. Their inner cognitive dissonance causes them to fall prey to their own confirmation bias.
His self awareness comes with strange peaks and mostly troughs - it’s interesting how he’s never been able to see that with her, he really is looking in the mirror. 

And also how he professes to want someone who sees him as he is and likes him when that’s literally what Love is. Man doesn’t know what he wants (which really is just to do more predatoring)
i honestly feel like joe has become *far* too unlikeable as a protagonist to star in this thing alone, his dynamics with love where kind of his only grounding. my hopes for season 4 are not high.
Yeah, I didn't like Dottie either but she didn't lie!! I lowkey thought Love was gonna snap and kill her mom, especially after the scene with her drunk driving.
Yes. Its just really cringy to watch. She just says " I did this because of you so you clean it up". Even in the last episode she's still saying "You did this". I dont understand how she went to being such a spoiled, whiny, entitled brat. I hate it when guys get the cool, calm and confident writing and women get the 'I cant control my emotions, irrational, insecure' writing. Its such a cliché.
No, Joe didnt made her like this, she was always like this. 

Wanting to blame Ellie
Killing 2 women in season 2
What she did to her ex husband
The nanny

She was always unhinged, but because we didnt live with her we didnt see. Neither did Joe. We see now because Joe lives with her.
Nope, not sure where I said that. It's typically the guy who is always vilified though even though they are both being horrible. Joe could probably say the sky is blue and she would fly off the handle and scream at him. I don't know why the writers decided to make almost every woman Joe interacted with so defensive and snarky towards him.
Agree :)
Yeah, it's like a milder version of what we saw with Skyler from Breaking Bad.
Idk it seems to be such a rich person problem. Like at the point where someone is complaining that a neighbourhood is "too safe" or "too nice", that's just spoiled. I feel like it was very on the nose especially during this housing crisis, as millions of people are struggling to find reasonable living places.  

I feel like it's very difficult to relate to how the show portrays the suburbs even though I live in the suburbs. But the suburbs here are nothing like the show portrays. Each house is completely different. Our city is very multicultural & even our street has people from all walks of life. 

In general though, no one knows each other or cares to bother with each others lives, even/especially in the fancier neighbourhoods.
Maybe somebody’s protecting Joe from the shadows…
I don't think they can match DNA by urine, perhaps only specifically gender and species (human/male).
henry is what chuck calls himself when he runs away to paris in s3. and also what blair and chuck name their son i think?
Same I don’t either
Sorry I don't convey my thoughts very well over lazy reddit texts...
actually thought love was gonna slash his neck with that key — would have been way cooler than always getting hit on the head by love
Theo's entire role in the story is inconsequential. You take Theo out of the story, it pans out the exact same way. Matthew eventually gets told to delete the footage on his own. Cary and Sherri escape on their own. Joe didn't exactly care about Love's affair, so it didn't impact their marriage at all. 

Theo is literally just there for some boring drama and to develop Love's grief over Forty, but they do absolutely nothing with it. All we discover is that Love's true soulmate is her brother, and nobody will ever satisfy the Forty shaped hole in her heart - which, again, Theo was largely inconsequential in us discovering this.

I really, really hated Theo's role in this season. Especially after finding out the actor is older than Victoria. Like, what was the point of this guy?
I think if joe became unexpectedly jealous of love’s affair it could have made the season more interesting. he could have wrestled with his obsession to protect both women and the “you” in his narration would get mixed up too.
I forgot. 😅  I assumed the film's old bc the movie characters wore pretty 2000s hairstyles and took place in middle school. It's a rom com though. Nothing bad actually happened in the movie.
He killed peach and she was a mirror in a way, and he didn't stop. If he did kill a part of himself by killing Love, it would be his self-awareness. He was seeing all the ugly parts of himself 
in her  though he denied it. He wanted to see why he was obsessed by Marienne so that Love wouldnt kill her, forcing him to reflect his psyche stemmed from his mommy issues. It forced him to recognize that, but with her gone, he doesnt have to do anything about it and he's bound to repeat the same thing over and over again. Same obsession ending in people dying and him running
I was pleasantly surprised to hear her narrate in episode 6. I was hoping that it was going to be a whole episode about her. That would’ve been cool.
>Joe would look like an unhinged lunatic (I mean, he already does to me & hopefully most other people, but you know).

This, so much this. The number of people complaining about how Joe became unlikeable this season is shocking. He's a creepy stalker and a murderer!
Even this isn't really true. Many of Joe's kills are either unintended or the end result of some other unintended violent outburst. He's just got a lot of experience in covering his tracks and also has been enormously lucky. Like the only reason he isn't in jail or dead as we speak is because Candace decided for some completely insane reason to not just go to the cops when he failed to kill her.
That's the only argument for Joe being a hypocrite? What about him calling Peach a deranged pervert for her obsession with Beck while he's stealing her panties and stalking around the house? There are dozens of scenes like this, where he looks down on someone for the exact same shit he's doing \*while he's doing it\*. The show constantly goes out of its way to show how much of a hypocrite Joe is.

That said, yes, obviously Love is a hypocrite too - they give her a few similar scenes, like when she mentions how fucked up Sherry and Cary are hours after locking them in the cage.
They’re both serial killers let’s not get it twisted. 

Personally, easier for me to sympathize with Love— watching her be gaslit and emotionally abused by her husband/family is tough (not that it absolves her of her crimes)

We get insight into Joe’s mind via narration and I can see how some people might sympathize more with him.  Not me tho  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[removed]
No at least Joe was trying to be normal, Love was just annoying
I want Matthew to hunt his ass down
I ALWAYS MAKE THIS COMPARISON TOO. 

No one watches breaking bad like "GOD DAMN I WANT HIM TO GET CAUGHT AND ARRESTED" same goes for this show
I meant before that sorry. like Joe Goldberg was around for 2-3 high profile murders right?

Beck, forty, love...just seems weird from an investigators perspective

did the PI not find anything
I thought he called him “Nietzsche.”
The writers can always make something up. Maybe Matthew is demoing a new surveillance technology to a client in Paris and suddenly, wouldn’t you know it…. There is Joe, on camera. I’m sure the talented writers can come up with something way less on the nose and contrived as that.
right but now he has to be infamous. even if they believe him dead, i would be extremely surprised if his victim status remains intact
What differences are there?
That was Joe narrating it as he believes it, that happens several times throughout the series where he’s wrong about an outcome.
For one, what does that have to do with what you specifically said.  Those two things I listed were based on what you said right now and I pointed out how unrealistic your expectations were about THAT and maybe you realize that since you edged into an entirely different topic without addressing what I said, instead
I get what you're saying, but to be really fair a majority of homicides are never solved by the police.  They have rules to abide by, so there are clear ways to get away with murder.
Yes! I'm seeing comments like "oh but he fell in love again after therapy". Like what part of that man is a sociopath don't y'all understand. Fans have definitely bought into his delusional beliefs and into Love's delusional beliefs too.
Yeah that's why I said maybe. And it most likely won't so I'm kind of surprised people really expected couple's therapy to do anything for him/them.
Love wasn't intending to kill Joe initially tho, his cheating had nothing to do with her growing the aconite. Her first husband wasn't cheating. She just wanted the upper hand if the worst happened.
I mean she hid her own cage key before knowing he was cheating too, so I don’t think the wolfsbane “retcon” was forced at all. she didn’t trust him even when she thought he had stayed loyal and the paralytic is a tactic she has used before.
One confusion I have is what was the point of Marianne. I get the writers were trying to stay somewhat to the story line of Joe finding “YOU” but I would’ve love to see growth between Joe and Love working together. Not Joe finding someone new.
uh maybe just me but I think when you get paralyzed the relationship is over...
I think the wolfsbane was not out of place. She did say she used it on her first husband, which of course could be a detail thrown in at last minute, but she knew when Joe was distracted the first time with Natalie and she knew he’d been distracted again even if Joe thought he was being careful. She knew him extremely well and knew his patterns so it’s not unlikely for her to plan for if he got obsessed with someone else again. She did say in like the second or third episode that sometimes she wondered if he would kill her.
Itd be way better I agree. For better and for worse.
I thought it predictable too which is why I was hoping for a different outcome and just got disappointed that it was so straightforward.
I agree I would have loved that I just don’t think Victoria wanted to continue
I'm sorry, but were Book 1 and 2 also this crazy?

Storywise, Book 3 sounds way too batshit crazy and almost makes the show look like a tame documdrama.
that’s…something
Thanks for this I’m so glad the show didn’t follow the books because that would’ve been awful! Although I liked season 2 as a whole better I still really liked this season

Both of Joe’s and Love’s decisions and charter arcs made sense to me. It was true to who they are after what they had been through in the last season 

A question for the book: >! I read somewhere that Love had died by the end of the book after attempting to kill herself and Joe but Joe survived. Is that true? !<
That's amazing to hear and I am happy to hear that she survived in the books and got the heck away from him because I really loved Love on the show even though she did horrible things (which I believe is also because of how awesome VP played her). 
Well, he certainly seems to enjoy the chase, conquer, and kill pattern in the books too. :( thank you so much for filling me in on the happenings in the book. 💜 I personally give season three a one and a half because the lady five-six episodes of the show was a total chore to get through, me and my brother were counting down the episodes until it /finally/ ended. It honestly felt like it was taking an **eternity** to get through then the character assassination nearly all season and death of Love ruined it even more for me.
Love was annoying the shit out of me honestly. The lack of self awareness and hypocrisy was painful.
It says at the end of the credits in the last episode “it’s official another season is coming”
I would have thought Bad Blood would have gone so well with this season too 😂
Exile is one of her best songs ever, truly magnificent.
No clue. I probably misinterpreted some news I spent 5 seconds digesting. But, from a very old, foggy memory it had something to do with silence after Chris D'Elia went down for sexual misconduct. People felt like Penn's inaction may have represented tacit approval or something. (Interesting parallels to the Nurse Fiona storyline) But, I see he at least eventually issued a statement that seemed to denounce the guy.
And Karla Homolka, who people didn't realize had so much to do with the crimes Paul Bernardo committed until she took a plea deal. She's arguably the more insane person and she's been out for years and had a kid and married the brother of the lawyer that got her off while Bernardo probably won't see the outside world without a cage blocking his view ever again.
Jennifer Pan didn’t kill her parents, she hired someone to murder them.
Na lol women have less testosterone  therefore are less aggressive by nature
First act of S3 was more fun and campy to me (episodes 1-5ish), when Joe and Love were in therapy and on team Suburban Serial Killer together.

The buildup to the finale was a little dull, like you mentioned— a buildup to a final confrontation. It felt a bit slow/repetitive when Joe was back on his BS stalking Marianne. I had nothing invested in their relationship because she was clearly just his next victim, same ole story. 

Last couple episodes it picked up and I was pleasantly surprised by the character arcs and resolution
Exactly what I was missing. Joe was almost caught before but now he'd doing whatever and his inner monologue was subpar.
I may be in the minority, but I actually found season 2 to feel slow.

You're right. Book/Season 1/2 are awesome because the author employs contrasts and ironies like Beck and Love. The author created characters in a classic way. The show runners spent one episode telling us Beck's daddy issue that foreshadows her tragedy, and makes her balanced and real. And Joe, mommy. Love, sibling.  
What made the ending of book 3 lies in these A-Rose-for-Emily type dark secrets.  
I still believe the most elegant way is to let some victims inspire Joe to realize how their drives and secrets lead them to the tragic end like him and Love. He couldn't face it like facing his own sins about his mom. He did what he did in book 3. He bailed.  
So Love had to do it like the ending of book 3. She gave up because the sin is too deep and she couldn't face it without Joe, either. They decently sacrificed. And maybe one or both survived but torn apart.  
But they chose not to stick to the characters the author created.
She shot Joe and committed suicide in the ending of book 3.
Marianne told Joe she wanted to take her daughter to Paris if she won the custody hearing. Since Joe couldn’t find their whereabouts at the end, he went to Paris hoping to find them there.
Whoa, that would make S4 watchable for me.
Nah she was laying on the floor for a LONG time because Joe had to cook the potpie, write the emails, chop off his toes, give himself first aid. Home girl is dead
Then, you should avoid the Internet. It’s not like I am saying everyone with BPD is a murderer. It’s just this show portray someone with it. 

So, if some character in a show got diagnosed with autism for example and it is someone with negative personality, we shouldn’t mention it?
So true, I flinched once or twice because he also oversimplified her
100% agree. The very end when he burns the photos and steps OVER her body just hammered the nail in the coffin. He literally did not care or respect her at all, so heartbreaking bc she was so genuine in her love for him (vs him where he’s only in this bc of Henry).
There were a lot of un necessary.plot lines that kind of took away from what could have been a great reel in for keeping her on another season. She wasn't a good person, she just wasn't as erratic in season 2. If she was there would have been a trail of dead drug dealers all over the place from the people her brother hung out with
I'm thinking that might have happened because he was looking through all the footages (lord knows how many) person by person (if you recall the "search function". His focus was on Love rather Joe. From what he said about Joe, he didn't even suspect him.
I agree. Even though I haven’t liked any of Joe’s obsessions (not including Marianne — I’m neutral on her), Beck certainly was the most interesting. It really put into perspective how delusional Joe was, even if she wasn’t all that hot in terms of morality either. S1 is arguably the best out of the 3. And she is far better than Love, haha.
First of all, “Joe stans”? I find it odd that you would immediately focus on a statement made in passing about Joe looking more sympathetic this season — and assume, based on the little information given, that I excuse his actions and actively root for him. And even if I did, it’s quite literally a television show that intentionally tries to make you see such a terrible person in a good light… it wouldn’t be the end of the world, which is why I’m confused as to why your first reaction is to be demeaning.

I don’t argue with them both being bad people. I don’t need this explained to me in the slightest, when I have watched the show, clearly. I don’t argue with Joe having a pattern of toxicity — obviously. 

And key-word: “in a sense”. Because, as far as we know, she wasn’t constantly killing every single person that wronged him like she did this season with Joe. You’re once again taking my words extremely literally in an effort to be upset about something that is nothing to be upset about in the first place. If I’m wrong and she was doing all of that, fine, I’m wrong, but MY interpretation was that Forty was not enabling her behavior by hiding bodies and treating it like it was normal.
He’ll wear baseball cap wdym
If it were realistic, he would have a whole subreddit with Reddit internet sleuths looking him, an HBO special/Hulu docu-series in production, and about 10 true crime podcasts about his crimes (complete with a devoted TikTok fan base a la Menendez brothers)
I guess he counts for the show's overall body count, but I don't include him in Joe and Love's. They contributed, but ultimately it was due to his own family's actions. He knew they were about to release him and took his own life anyway.
I was far more interested in Joe and Love's dynamic to care about Marianne. I wanted them to thrive and survive their neighbors, overcome their patterns and temptations and then literally run away from each other since they are both killers. But then, the rain happened, then polyamory ensued and other several fuckeries and then poison has fast effects when absorbed through skin apparently... Anyway, there's a season 4.
I thought her acting was great (at the least, just as good as all the other characters). But maybe the chemistry was off? Also probably skewed because Love/Joe had an entire previous season to work together and learn acting styles so viewers see the “connection”
I agree! They both had similar backgrounds (minus the killing). I actually hoped they were endgame
she annoyed me fr
This. Also this made Joe look like a pathetic cover-up weak partner and ruined his character in the process.
i love the absurdity and larger than life caricature characters personally, it’s delightfully deranged
what it is is a complete camp melo/psychodrama with a veneer of real life on it. there’s no way joe would get away with half the shit he did in actual reality, we’re just here for the suspension of disbelief and OTT storytelling - just like Desperate Housewives (which i agree w a lot of reviews about, in terms of tone this season)
I just don't understand what people think a "realistic" version of a murderous couple who both have severe abandonment issues and the husband hypocritically hates the wife for being a murderer and has a compulsion to obsessively stalk women is supposed to look.
LMAO I noticed that too
It just makes me sick how they use violence against women as plot points for this character who has 0 development over the span of 3 seasons. Yes, Love was crazy but they wrote her that way. They clearly wanted her to look a lot worse in comparison to Joe.
She isn't a stereotype though? That's just how Joe the unreliable narrator shows her. Also she hasn't changed she was just putting on a front in season 2

If you hate Joe so much stop watching the show
I dont you have been paying attention, the show is all about joe, it started with him and will end with him, honestly love was  getting too annoying as fk like how many deaths can she cover up? It was getting too absurd
It feels like directors do this when they aren't sure of killing the character and are waiting for the response from viewers a lot of the time
I wonder if by responses like most people’s here—do they know it’s based on a books series? I didn’t until a couple months ago and a good two years of watching.

Not that the show would necessarily follow it completely but whether Love survives or not is a pretty major plot point I wouldn’t expect to change.
[removed]
The story got old.
I mean ... this show clearly demonstrates that people who know how to respect each other & aren't selfish, boring whiny assholes are most likely to end up in a good marriage
If they found Joe's 2 toes he cut off (1 of which was literally cooked in a pie) then the cops definitely found Loves body.
Yeah it makes more sense he bought a new ID from Will. Or he just offed someone name Nick when he got there lol.
Oh even better he probably bought a new ID FROM Will since we know they are still in touch.
omg I didn't even catch that. Guess we'll see how it plays out 🤷🏽‍♀️
Yea obviously, half of his character is that he's an attractive smart person.
Translation : He's hot.
From the very beginning Joe had another You when he could have been there for love. Im not saying Love isn't crazy but he caused her to be as crazy as him. I love YOU but at some point Joe gotta realize that he will never find the perfect person because there will always be another person out there. I really hope Love is still alive.
We can only hope. Honestly a Joe following another woman story line just seems so boring.
Ah thanks! got it, yeah it was weird and the marienne thing was so forced
Damn hope you’re doing better now
Thank you I don't get Beck's hate. People almost feel like she deserved what happened to her. It made me scared because I can somewhat relate to her as you said her faults cover most people. I like that she was not a villain but flawed. Out of nowhere but now it's trendy to hate Carrie from SatC for almost the same mistakes. I appreciate the flawed characters. Also Becky was intelligent and the actress did a good job.
Great minds.. (joking). With Beck you had everything and it just clicked. Also the literal writing for the characters was the best. I liked it also as a social media commentary which in later seasons was abandoned.
refreshing-till-it-hit-netflix gang rise up😩✊
This is the season 3 overall discussion thread, don't think you need to do that, plus when you do that most (I assume) would think it's a book spoiler.

I avoided everything about you on the net until I finished it, literally just finish it.
None of this is ok lmao. Obviously none of these people are redeeming characters, but in the context of the series you gotta take sides.

In Loves eyes Joe was her soulmate, and all she wanted was to have a normal life with Joe and Henry and to put the past behind them. Lol why is it crazy to expect your partner to be faithful? Especially after you got married? And as far as James is concerned, like I said we don’t know anything about him other than he was her ex husband. She may have been justified in  accidentally killing him. He could have killed more people than Love. Love saw that Marianne was caught up in the web that is Joe Goldberg, and her child walking in was just the tip of the iceberg. And through all her craziness, she was still a mother. She truly cared about Henry. And all Joe did was give him up so he could devote all his time to chasing another girl. And there is no perfect “You” for Joe. There’s no perfect you for people in real life. In Joes eyes the perfect you is someone that could change him for the better, but at the same time someone that can accept his past. And that’s impossible to find for him. Love could accept him for him because she’s an extension of Joe, but he no longer wants to be with her now because of that.
I too was not expecting that and now I wish to get my time back wasted on this season.
Never said it wasn’t just making a side comment
literally lmao, thats why its funny these redditors wanted her to live instead.
Same, her character was still interesting and refreshing anyway. She is much more unhinged that Joe tbh.
Bad bot.
Yes, you said boredom means you were never Interested
Wasn’t it VTech Baby Cam or something like that? How is that supposed to be a real camera?
Wow, that's *very* different from the show so far lol.
It's just my theory to try to get Love back ahaha but on my 100th rewatch of the season, I was like "wait a minute". I guess we'll have to wait and see ;)
Weirdest bit of the whole season.
*Cary trying to be a beast*
Joe works at a library: S1 and S3


Joe kills his former lover at the end of the season: S1 and S3


Joe at some point has competition for the person he loves: S1 and S2


Joe has someone actively looking to expose him with major information: S2


Joe is in a totally different environment to what he's used to and/or likes: S2 and S3


Joe intentionally kills the people he stalks: S1


Joe gets with a "rebound girl" after he breaks up with his lover: S1 and S2


Joe and his lover seek therapy about their relationship: S1 and S3


Joe is cheated on: S1 and S3


Joe has an intense need to protect a child he just met: S1 and S2


Joe falls in love with a woman who's experiencing a lot of stress in their life: S1 and S3


Lets get real here, the only reason why Season 3 seems "fresh" is because Joe isn't a single man at the start of the season. He's 9 months into living in a new place, rather than seeing his immediate reaction to it on arrival. And while the suburban life is an interesting choice, its ultimately just more of Joe having more pretentious monologue like with his time in LA and NY, where he just goes "oh look at these people so vapid and self-absorbed". But in S2 at least, he was taking in LA culture entirely and did many activities which he eventually came to somewhat accept. The cheating aspect you talk about in S3 that is apparently so unique was literally in Season 1, Beck cheated on Joe with her therapist. And unlike Season 2, Season 3's side characters are a lot more cartoonish and don't really have interesting goals or motivations.


Season 2 had Will, who presented a change in Joe's behaviour in not immediately killing someone who caught him. Candace, who was a direct consequence of Joe's past actions and essentially a looming figure for the season with no idea what she is planning. Ellie and Delilah, who had their own motivations that were shown throughout the season and interwoven with Joe's story. Among the main characters who aren't Joe and the most prominent female character, Forty made the best trio of main characters. Who's the Forty equivalent in S3 - Dottie Quinn? She's funnily enough one of the weaker characters in S2, and the fact that she's used as a major character who mostly just calls herself Glamma and kisses Henry just shows how fascinating S3 was in its characters.


Season 3 has Joe's baby, who is barely around and has a mini arc at the beginning with the baby not crying when Joe is around eventually - not that interesting. Joe also has the whole swinging aspect that was introduced to him, which was cut short for the sake of shock value. His new lover is also yet another mess in their life, with nothing particularly interesting about her - since we already got asshole ex storylines before. Love set herself apart from Beck by coming in a "package deal" with Forty - in that Joe would inevitably have to be around Forty if he wanted to be with Love - and then there's the twist, which still hasn't been beaten since.
It went down hill for me, as soon as his "mysterious" neighbor, offered him diapers and condoms in the parking lot. Just... No.

That was the "Teaser" we all waited a year for?  GTFO!
Oh yes he's gonna have a couple of tough moments (including the measles) but I assure you that he's gonna be ok in the end!
Yeah
Month old blood is usually deep red, black-ish. It takes a few days to go from red to that. Mind you, she found it the same day so it could have been wet still
He didn't have to, there was very little obstacles in his way to win over loves affection, and his hesitation to kill Delilah or even mikes was because he wanted to be worthy of "loves" affection. His obsession's of "love" was greater then beck, in my opinion
Did he though? It would have been interesting to see him in jail and see how Joe died. 

Or in season 4: physical evidence showed show that joe may not have died in the fire. & Then dr.Nicky goes into this deep obsession over Joe. & eventually gets the support of the authorities. & Joe is caught and goes down for everything. 

Joe is forced to confess…. I’ll stop there, I don’t want to ruin the ending.
rich middle aged 'woke' people ? Lol tell me more
No, but if you think this show-where The only unironically woke character who isn't an idiot or a hypocrite was that librarian and she was genuinely a victim of racism and classism,then what do you consider un-woke , shows that pretend the world is a utopia and social issues don't exist ?
this, THIS!!!! you put all my exact thoughts/feelings into your reply!! I know they're both batshit insane, but I just could not stand Joe AT ALL this season. He cheated twice, forgot about his family, and then gaslights his wife to a breaking point??
It was showing that neither one trusted the other and thought they might get locked in the cage by the other in the future. They both hid a key so they could get out if the other locked them in.
That's obviously not true. Still the whole vax plot felt forced.
Yes, so you are saying he could potentially be character, anyone can. Theo currently is one of the worst characters i have ever witnessed in a series
and black people can't swim, lmao. You see the problem?
Huh? Did we watch the same show?? The measles plot was the whole reason Love attacked Gil and used him to turn the Natalie situation into a murder suicide... She wouldnt have attacked him if Henry didnt get sick.
Can you explain how they were comparing the two? I think with the current times yea the topic of vaccines is more relevant than ever, but that entire plot could have been included in a tv show pre-Covid and would have still made the same point. The measles vaccine has been around for decades. The point was Loves baby was infected by an easily preventable (practically eradicated) disease which upset her and led her to assault Gil, that’s pretty much it. Whether someone wants to get the Covid vaccine is one thing, getting the measles vaccine is another, and so is getting a flu shot, and so on.
They’re only several years apart as characters. If I were 40 and my husband were 50, would you freak out? So if Theo’s character is 19 and she’s what…like 25? Honestly, her character would match Theo’s way more than Joe’s. Joe seems like a much bigger age gap with Love than Love and Theo.
She even made a comment about him having to grab the knife to get poisoned...
Your statement is still valid. If they want to liken it to real life why mention Covid and then not follow through with it. 

I know the answer is that you can’t really act and get the full range of emotion to show on your face if your face is half covered. But then just leave it out :|
 he did have a black girlfriend in the first season too
Well weak wasn't the right word, but you know compare to the other season.
Well…joe wrote both letters. He wrote the Love letter as an angry, scorned, murderous woman who was confessing to all her crimes and lambasting the community and the societal standards as well. 

The letter he wrote to Dante was him saying he knew he was about to die and to please love and protect his son and keep him away from Dottie. It appears to people as an admirable thing….a father trying to save his baby as a last desperate act. Insinuating that the “crazed mother” would have also come for baby Henry.
I hope not lol, I really liked Love… I think Joe is beholden to a pattern and he’s going to repeat no matter what the circumstances say
Ohhhhh, okay. So, not killing people. That's good.
Same
Some wolfsbain might help
Thanks I'm sad now
Bruhhh
Very fitting of the statistic that most men maim and most women poison
Dexter and Hannah McKay type beat
I instantly thought of Ginny and Georgia
Yes! I thought I remembered someone talking about Love using it in previous episodes but I was confusing it with Ginny and Georgia. You just reminded me.
Yes on the patio
Lol yeah I thought that for just a moment too! His silence paired with her telling Joe not to check on him when he arrived, I think it might been an intentionally momentary bait by the show runners.
I was really worried she had already killed Henry or placed him in precarious danger. Never crossed my mind that he was the meal, god damn. That's dark.
I still thought it was Henry until we finally saw his face. I didn’t trust the baby cries either.
I thought it was gonna be Marienne
That’s hilarious I’m dying
Ok this show is gory and violent but holy fuck it’s not this dark y’all. Some crazy imaginations here.
I genuinely thought it would be >!Marienne’s head!<.
What was going to be Henry? Didn’t quite get it
Either him or Marienne
Same! But I felt the show would really jump the shark if so.
I kept saying to myself “She Medea’d her kid!”
I thought it was gonna be Mari😭😭😭😭
I had that thought, too but I think it would have been too risky for the show if a child was killed. That would be too dangerous of a line to cross.
Woah that would of changed loves character so much in my opinion
She wasn't, she told Joe that she was going to fix their marriage. It was her conversation with Marienne that convinced her to kill Joe. She decided that Joe was the problem, not her.
After Marianne is when she gets the idea that single motherhood look noble
 Snap I totally missed that... I'll have to re-watch
what if just wanted one of the chicken legs?
Wasn’t the adrenaline the antidote? One of the drugs in the case said that it takes 45 minutes to take affect. I figured that was the way that the writers justified him being on the floor immobile for so long.
Maybe the antidote just kept him from dying?
Thank you!!
Yeah I don’t “get invested” in any of Joe’s obsessions except for hoping they don’t die a horrible death. I’m confused by people saying this. Are they hoping to see Joe find a soulmate and live happily ever after? Bc I’m hoping to see him dead or in jail at the end of the show (just please don’t make him a lumberjack! Ahem Dexter 😉)
I think he wants someone that doesn’t exist bc she is not a whole human being. Someone who is malleable and does exactly what he wants at all times. Someone who loves him unconditionally and selflessly and needs him to protect her. What he imagines a mother should be / his mother should have been. What he wants isn’t real, because he is sick.
I think a final season where he gets caught or killed will be a good ending. For Joe it is a romance, but for the viewer it’s a show about a serial killer. So yeah to us he found the perfect partner and if things had ended differently and they kept on going together that would be a cool story too. But for the story we have now, there isn’t a point to another romance because yeah we know how it would turn out. He would eventually get disappointed and kill her for one reason or another and it wouldn’t be anything new, because as established that is his pattern.
That was the whole point of OP’s comment. They said Love bakes when she’s stressed. She opened a bakery for the whole season. Then this guy responds but isn’t she stressed the whole season?

Duh!! That’s the point! She baked the whole season… with the bakery the OP mentioned😂😂
The power of youth
Did she even check if he was still breathing erm. She's the careless sort of killer unlike Joe
I once walked into a lamp-post and survived.
The power of LOVE
Theo is that you
Well tbf seems like he was in n physical therapy for weeks and still couldn't walk at the end there
College parties prepare your body for far worse.
He was covered in plot armour!
Would've fit right in with the Parasite universe.
Have you seen car crashes people survive? I thought he was dead too, but Itbis believable someone could survive a blow to the head followed by a fall down the stairs, lol. Plus, Someone needs to be left alive to corroborate Love’s crazy.
Sounds like Bella from Twilight 🥴
I think the show is purposely absurd so people know not to try that. I remember in season 1 people wanted to be relatable to Joe, which is a red flag if I ever seen one.
Yess, I mean Henderson got killed by joe when he pushed him in the stairs and like die completely and if I remember correctly it wasn’t a lot of damage he had, Theo got punched by a fire cylinder and fell down a lot of stairs way more than henderson and beat his head, while Henderson who is bigger more robust just got killed by some stupid thing is like wtf
head injuries bleed a lot idk
Yeah that was my thought too… I also remember watching a video of some detectives or doctors or something and they mentioned how much blood ment you were dead and Theo was close to the amount that showed there was no way he lived. Idk how he was still alive and Nathalie wasn’t but oh well
Yep , I turned the show off after that because I was so upset he was dead ! lol he was such a cutie and sweetheart
I think the latter. Because of the way that he attacked Candice and “killed” her (or so he thought)
Bro if you hate it so much now then it's just weird you're all over this sub
Gosh that would have been such an interesting storyline
I thought it was interesting he started publicly going by Joe Goldberg again this season, when he made it a point to change his identity at the beginning of season 2.
Yup same
I kept expecting this twist with Natalie and then Marienne. Maybe next season!
Oohhhhh this would have been awesome
I’m glad they didn’t decide to go that way with it however it will get cheesy after time if he constantly gets away with things
Bored housewife move quickly.
MAN that's what I want for the final season. I wanted this one to end differently and then the final season (the next one) be about Joe getting tracked down by law enforcement. Because now, it feels like the show can only move forward in a really formulaic manner and idk, that seems tedious after everything that's happened.
Yeahhhh but the neighbors already lived in the house when Joe and Love moved in. I don't see it working.
love even says this in the season 2 finale. “when i was seeing you, REALLY seeing you- you were gazing at a goddamn fantasy. a perfectly imperfect girl.” love called him on his shit straight up but joe never learns.
This is good stuff ^
I agree, but I think people didn't like Beck because her character intentionally created uncomfortable drama that grinded the gears of MC. Like, at some point it became clear this is her purpose now.
Yes
Love racked up quite the body count! I imagine Victoria Pendretti probably really enjoyed playing Love against type. She also does the Flannagan Horror shows where she's usually shown in a sympathetic, nurturing light.
Yeah, there’s always a good chance America is obsessing over a missing white woman pretty regularly so it’s a coincidence. They did mention a ‘Tracey Paulson’ I think was the name as being a big case where a woman was murdered by her husband, I assumed that was a Laci Peterson reference? I was living in the US when Laci went missing and I remember when they were covering the search 24/7 they found *another* dead pregnant woman, and everyone was so upset, assuming it was Laci, but it was a Mexican pregnant woman whose husband killed her. Being new to the US I was horrified. I was like, wait…. Back up…. Why wasn’t anyone looking for the other woman and covering it 24/7?  Who was she? If there was coverage could they have found her in time? Maybe saved the baby? 

CNN was like ‘it’s ok guys, it’s not Laci’. I also remember while they were covering it on the 6 o’clock news a black teenage girl was found dismembered in a garbage can in our state and it was just a minor story then… ‘And now, back to the search for Laci Peterson!’. I honestly asked my husband why do some people get coverage and not others? Because that’s not a thing in my country. I’m glad they are pointing out the disparity, and how someone like Joe could operate undetected for years if his victims weren’t pretty, affluent white women.
Yeah it really has. Idk though, they mention it’s “America’s favorite pastime next to porn” though even though it’s a pretty well-documented phenomenon globally. Which makes me think there’s something America-specific about its inclusion in the plot

But you’re right.  That seems a little too difficult to include in the one month between the incident and this new season’s release
It is *a* central theme of the season, my apologies. But it is very prevalent throughout

Marienne’s arc is another example that repeatedly highlights systemic inequality and some of its ramifications

She and her reprehensible ex-boyfriend, Ryan Goodwin (a surname that already suggests the character’s role) were both addicts together. 

Marianne got clean and got a steady job as a librarian. Ryan *purportedly* got clean and received a much loftier set of opportunities

In legal disputes regarding the custody of the couple’s daughter, Marienne’s past is often held against her. Meanwhile, Ryan’s isn’t. And it’s shown Ryan is friends with the judge and has a lot of influence inside and outside the courtroom.

We also see these hardships may even tempt Marienne to relapse out of sheer helplessness. 

Yes, systemic inequality is repeatedly brought up, and is woven into the fabric of the narrative
Before 2020 it was still near the 50% mark
Do you mean because teams of detectives weren't getting together to solve them due to COVID? (genuine question)

That's a huge bummer if so, the virus sucks but solving homicides seems important enough to still get together but just be extra careful 😕
That was one of the things that was explained pretty well though
When love was texting forty it actually made me like her more bc she at least has insight about what she is doing and her flaws. Joe is delusional and hypocritical to the maximum
yeah if you think about it she wasn’t going back and forth so much up until she realized he wasn’t into her anymore and that’s when she started asking him why he didn’t love her and so on. that’s when the affair with theo started too
I will say that some of this feels like commentary on criminal justice in America in general. First of all, there are big problems with jurisdictions not communicating regularly, so in LA they wouldn't have records of his interviewers with NYPD, same for Madre Linda. He also comments on his white male privilege throughout the series and how this frequently allows him to talk his way out of trouble. There are a lot of murders that go unsolved every year, but he has also just been very lucky. I do agree that the pee jar is a big plot hole though.
lmao it was renewed last week
literally
They failed to make Marianne like-able…. She was so ehhhhhh to me.
Dante and baby Henry were the only likeable characters throughout
Marienne was cool
I think we’re supposed to hate Joe. Joe will never love what he knows. He loves his idealist fantasies. I think that if he lived with Marienne and they had to talk about bills and yeast infections he’d lose interest in her too. I remember Penn Bagley saying in an interview that no one should be into his character and I’m heeding his advice. 😂
eh, tbh i was fine with the anti-vax references. after all, those were still real-world problems. but i agree with u on love. for me, love was a straight up mess in season 3 and didnt have any intent to change (unlike joe). joe did kill ryan, but that mf deserved it. i still think both of them deserved to die, but if i had to pick one love definitely deserved it more. not to mention that love tried to kill him first AND she wouldve handled henry worse than joe…
It took place in a rich privileged SoCal neighborhood. They were supposed to all be annoying.
tbh i think that most everything that happened in the cage can be excused. it was a very high stress situation, people are not going to act normally when their lives are on the line. it's definitely very weird to me how love and sherry became friends when we've seen how fake sherry is
I didn’t like how it seemed like she was willing to let her husband die, but when she said it was for the kids and then actually gave examples I was like “oh okay I see your point”
dude this is the comment i’ve been looking for. seeing them holding hands at a ted talk was hilarious saying how they mastered the box and stepping into a pretend one 😭😭😭
Why shouldn’t they though?? They’re badass winners with a truly authentic marriage they work for each day. Yeah a bit overboard with the body hacking stuff, but who cares.
Out of all the characters in this season, they were really “real” compared to the super fake neighborhood. They were just real narcissists
And their love was true. They overcame the challenge together in the end
“Don’t forget, 6% body fat” I diedddd 😂
Theo is an annoying idiot teenager, but he didn't deserve to die. I'm glad he survived.
U mean Blythe?? The writer?
at least she respected the safe word lol
Ikr!?  “I’m okaaaay”😂😂😂. I died ( pardon the pun).
Shalita Grant was one of my most anticipated actors coming into this season, becoming a fan of her through her turn as Cassidy Diamond on Search Party. Travis Van Winkle was great too. Cary and Sherry are my favorite new characters this season for sure.
Cary yelling "look at my dick" killed me
“Ohmygodyouvegottobefuckingkiddingme :falls over like she’s been tranquilized:” lmao girl was about to FINISH, I guess.
Man, I hated her cuts but >!I was so happy when both she and her husband got out though!<
RIGHT?! I didn’t expect to almost *like* her after that!!
Haha that one cracked me up!🤣
"don't get hysterical, I took a seminar"
True, I forgot a couple people haha, which I guess is easy to do since Joe kills so many people LOL
He probably used Quinn money for everything, but sending money to Ellie. I forgot his exact words but he mentioned not wanting the Quinn’s to find any connection to Ellie and him sending money to her
*Marianne
His LA apartment was nearly $2k before utilities 😵‍💫  no way he was making that work on a grocery store clerk budget, and we all know his counterfeit book scheme went to pay for all the other expenses he racked up IE the real Will Bettelheim’s debt. I swear living in LA kills the magic in some of these shows 😔
I’ve mentioned this on this sub before and everyone acted like I was being overdramatic about the COL in those areas!
Sorry gravedigging but in the show Becks place is supposed to be subsidised by the school, which is part of why she can’t lose her full time status in the first season
I think that's explained in the book! I can't remember since it was a while but I think she won cheaper housing through something after not being accepted into the college she was after. Not 100% sure about it tho
He said he didn’t want Quinn money to find out about Ellie
And you know her shitty ex was probably making her pay child support just to mess with her
I know I just hateee that trope
Mr moony was still alive and when did they say he adopted joe
Not nice.  It was a walk-up.
Yeah he says in the first episode that Loves parents funded all of it for them.
Don’t forget she also made keto scones! She probably tried to appeal to everyone’s dietary preferences.
People would probably visit from nearby towns (I headcanon Madre Linda as being in the South Bay)
It just stopped showing it because it's not really relevant anymore. He might've still be doing it. He also says he sends it "when she lets him know where she is" or whatever, so maybe she's the one who stopped writing first
Wtf me too because my fiance works starting at 5 and does overnights and can't stand this type of show. 🤣
Hello you, are you me?
Also me
His internal sense of humor is hilarious tho.
i do quite like the commentary on shallowness
Yeah that was odd.
Yes I had that DiCaprio pointing meme moment when I realized it.
Marianne said that her dream was to take julienne and go back to Paris if she knew Ryan couldn’t find them, so I think that’s why at the end Joe is in Paris
That’s a really cool concept
"A Fresh Tart"
Theo’s dad wouldn’t have called the cops because he didn’t have solid evidence, he wanted personal revenge, and what he was doing was a 1000% illegal violation of privacy laws. But everything else, yes. I cannot suspend my disbelief anymoreeee. This season was so rushed and ridiculous
Idk man. I had the same reaction then I had to step back and think. 

I’ve actually just been threatened with a knife last week at the gym. By the cable rack. And I didn’t call the cops. 

Tbh sometimes bravado and ego will make you ignore cops and adopt a ‘let’s finish this like men’ attitude. Fucking stupid too. And with Theo idk I had a friend get stabbed in high school and he didn’t call the cops either.
Speaking of the PI I’m surprised that it didn’t come up more. Once that part was revealed, I was expecting the PI to notice Joe stalking Marienne
Yeah but the fact that Joe was Love’s husband would have afforded him getting Scott free from the criminal justice system. Remember what happened with Love with the babysitter and her mother when she drove drunk with Henry on her lap and burned down her vineyard.
Ryan is clearly an ego maniac hyped up on stimulants. I don't think he is the type of character to throw out his drugs and call the cops because his ex girlfriends crush is following him..

After Joe mentioned the drugs, I think Ryan would  attempt to sabotage Joe's life in his own way.

I think it's a combination of Ryan not willing to dispose of his drugs and wanting to hurt Joe even deeper for him even knowing about the drugs in the first place.
Ryan in Ryan’s situation would not have. Stimulant junkie who prides himself on strength and beat the shit out of Joe?

Please tell me what he should call the cops and say. “Hey officer this guy was totally following me (I have no proof) and I just beat the shit out of him.”
Exactly. The show has so many plot holes and the way that Joe gets away with murders is almost laughable. Like how does old $ Peach not have a personal security guard with her 24/7 immediately after the Central Park attack? Even if she wants Beck to be there alone with her. She could also hire a PI before her death too. Also how does the Salinger estate not have any external security cameras? Even if she doesn’t, her neighbors might.
I’m with you right until Theo and peach
Peach was in shock and she is also insane, but she might’ve called the cops
On the other hand Theo was still convincing himself that love was innocent and had nothing to do with it so he wanted to protect her
I really love seeing that vernacular in the wild.
That's pretty insightful and I hadn't considered it.
Why do yall want Joe in jail? He's not a bad guy, he just does bad things that are usually justified.
you’d be surprised even losing a pinkie toe can mess up your balance and the way you walk. it happened to my grandpa.
OMG that’s crazy!! Thank you so much
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

Yes the off the shoulder white top was my favorite! I’ve already scoured all my usual websites for more stuff by that designer! Alas I think I’m too short for the jeans because they’re definitely not hem-able but I can just swoon over them on VP.
I’m honestly surprised about how much people didn’t like Beck lol I had a completely different experience.
Narc to me means narcotics agent. Do you mean it as in narcissist?
I'm a couple months late but I just had to say that I couldn't agree with you more.

I mean if people cant find true love through having lifestyles and secrets that niche (and yet so impactful to them) in common then what hope do the rest of us have?

 I really wanted him to make it work with love. She was perfect for him. A sociopath like he is and always keeping things interesting by killing people and making him cover for her. They could talk about murders and spend time together hiding bodies and evidence. I mean who doesnt want that?
Same. I know it's irrational to expect a sociopath like Joe to change, but it's equally irrational to ask viewers to watch the same story beats over, and over, and over...
Thank you for educating me/us all! Sounds terrible, I hate Anti vaxxers… not enough to hit them in the head with a rolling pin and lock them in a cage like Love did though…. Lol
[deleted]
Damn, the average person really doesn't know shit about how viruses work....
My favourite part was when the idiot dad said to Love that they should actually thank him because Henry got "natural" immunity from the incident 🤣 I think I can understand wanting to kill someone at that moment lol
Ha, yes! And with 2 keys shown being placed in the cage, I figured they were gonna find one. Glad it wasn’t too late for Cary.
Damn, I didn't even connect those dots. I love Joe's inner monologue and him making fun of alot of stuff, even common tropes in the show
I knew they were going to find the key but I thought that Joe would have figured Love hid a key and swapped hers out for a fake key, her hiding spot was truly trash lol. So I really thought they’d find Love’s key but it wouldn’t work cause I thought Joe would find it first
Carry let his mask fall and turned out to be a real human after all lol. Even seemed like the more decent one of them.
Didnt she? Bout the only thing she didnt have anything to do with, was him killing the news anchor guy.
The “Hashtag Natalie Come Home!” Had me rolling
Damn I had never seen her before this. She really must be. I went from “what a shameless little snake” to “yeah we would def vibe” and being pissed that Love called the sex off before Sherry could finish. I was like AT LEAST LET HIM GET HER OFF ONCE SHIT
I just realized you meant the series titled Search Party…. Not the search party event she hosted for Natalie
Hahaha so true!
I mean, Dante's Husband (boyfriend?) lives there too right?

I felt bad Giggling to myself a little bit when Joe asked Dante to "watch" Henry.  I'm a bad person.
omg! i was like “HES NOT GONNA SEE THR BABY THERE” then he cooed lol
Didn’t he still close the blinds when he did that?
I find it hilarious that it would've been a totally reasonable possibility that he just left Henry there
yup, her, stacey dash, monique coleman, angela from bmw, josie from riverdale, etc etc lol
because she still looks 17
In the book she’s 35. But the show has completely veered away from the books with season 3. It had elements that were the same, like the new love interest works at a library where Joe volunteers, it’s in suburbia, but not rich suburbia, it’s in a small town, and Love goes off the deep end but that’s it’s own thing, they don’t live together and don’t get married 


It’s funny though bc in the 3rd book his love interest is much older than him, about 10 years. And not like a super ultra hot older like that neighbor lady, just like a normal mom with a teen daughter. So kinda the opposite vibe.
I thought the actress who played Love was older, too!
Kind of related but when I found out that Laurence Fishbourne was young than Cuba gooding Jr in Boyz I'm the good I was baffled.
I thought she was maybe 28 (which come on, is very young still) she looks very young and beautiful but she just has a maturity in the way she acts and her body

And he could definitely pass for about 19-20 ish so I don’t think it’s offensive at all, he has a very teenager look about him, lucky him! He’s really cute
All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!

    18 +
    20 +
    24 +
    7 +
    = 69.0
I'm in my late twenties and live in hoodies haha.
yeah I was 18 two years ago and trust me...I don’t remember anyone lookin like that so I’m gonna take what you say with a grain of salt...no...a grain of air
Crap, sorry. I saw other people spoiling other properties, so I thought it was fine.

Seriously tho... the movie is kinda entertaining before >!Dave Franco's character dies.!< It all goes to shit after that.
Lol!
Fuck! Sorry. I thought about it, but I saw other people spoiling things no problemo, so I said "Why not?" Anywho, spoiler tag is there now.
Agree, but I also see his character changing a bit over time. Not in a redeemable way, but there are arcs.
Personally, I am not a fan of the trying to redeem a psycho stalker arch. I kind of think is waters down the whole point of the show if he gets redeemed in the end.
Not only one person..he killed Love too.
He didn't plan on killing him but he mercilessely went for the stab. He showed absolutely no remorse for his actions.
This is EXACTLY what I’ve been thinking. The fact that he completely abandoned the child and started over in Paris felt so lazy to me. I know he’s psychotic and delusional, and no one in their right mind would justify his actions in the real world, but I found myself rooting for him in s1 and s2, because that’s kind of what the show wants you to do. This season on the otherhand, I did not. I just absolutely despised him this season and was kind of hoping for him to get caught or killed in the season finale.

I also would have been completely fine with this being the last season if Love survived or she managed to "frame" him as a sign of irony or karma. Sure, the scene in the last episode got to me and made me feel a bunch of conflicting emotions, but it felt so... rushed? They could have gotten rid of her character without killing her off like that, because she deserved better. 

I wanted to like this season so bad, and it did have its moments, but I feel like they missed alot of opportunities this season. For example, when they talked about Matthew getting access to all the cameras, I immediately thought that he’d get access to Joe & Loves baby-monitor cam and see Sherry and Cary in the cage, but no. They even could’ve uno-reversed the situation between him and Love, by making him become a better version of himself after Henry, and then make Love into the jealous and obsessive one.
What bothers me though... If he really were to find Marianne and the daughter how is he gonna explain things to her? From her side she was told he killed her ex (which he did), is she not gonna question where his son is. That's assuming the tale of Love Quinn murder spree hasn't made international headlines already, in which case she would assume he was dead?! 

I'm also wondering if the note for Dante that Joe wrote was supposed to be from him or from Love like the 'confession' email at the end there...
He clearly grew. He was working on managing his obsessions, he purposefully didn’t take a keepsake of Marienne, and only reverted to his obsessive ways once he felt betrayed and hopeless about love. He even started diagnosing his mother issues himself and looking for that in his behaviours towards Marienne.

That’s growth. It doesn’t have to be permanent to be growth. Growth can be undone by events. That’s more realistic writing than people only ever getting better.
I think him leaving Henry behind was part of his development, because the whole time all he wanted to do was to protect Henry. He was worried about bullies, his son getting left to the system, he was worried about Love screwing him up and ultimately him hurting him too. That’s why he left Henry somewhere he knew he would be loved and cared for. From the last flashback conversation with his mom, she mentioned how she was still hurting him by raising him because of her mistakes (something like that) and I think he realized even though he wanted to be there and take care of his kid, that ultimately Joe’s own actions would hurt Henry more.
There are also very few scenes with Henry in general, this might be because it’s hard to film but it honestly didn’t feel like he was a character. They didn’t care about him, as the baby, but him as A baby and what makes them
Someone like that shouldn’t be a parent anyway.  I’m not justifying any of his behavior, but it’s honestly for the best.  I don’t believe in using human beings as a way to better oneself.  People should grow on their own, not use their children as a means of doing so.  Someone like Joe would inflict a hell of a lot of psychological damage on his child.  Joe needs years of psychotherapy.  Which he’s of course not going to do, but I personally think it’s better if he runs off instead of trying to fix himself for his kid and potentially fucking Henry up in the process.
I think y’all are just expecting this to be like other shows where the ultimate purpose is growth and redemption. The writers don’t WANT joe to grow and get better. And real people don’t usually come back from being a murderous obsessive stalker. I like the fact that he regressed because that’s realistic. This means he’ll probably go to jail or die a monster but it would be cheap to tell the same old story that monsters can change. Especially when joe isn’t working all that hard anymore to change. Growth requires work, not just wanting to be better. 
Even tho joe initially didn’t want to stalk Marianne he ended up doing it anyway because he didn’t keep fighting to stay aware of his actions and true motives
Totally what I felt. I hated Joe (and beyond him, the writers) for being reverted back to S1/S2 Joe while I rooted for Love, especially in the episode where she was sending messages to Forty and talked to him in a kind of hallucination (PS : thanks to S2 writers for making me like so much in the end a character I hated in the beginning).
This season was messy (Joe tries to save AND sabotage his marriage, says he loves Love and doesn't care about her, tries to change and reverts back to old Joe), bad written (Natalie killed too quickly, Love's absurd relationship with Theo, and so on) and really forgettable - like Indy 4, I wish I never saw it or could forget its existence.
As you said, only a return of Love in S4 would perhaps make me have a tiny interest in watching S4 (this and a shooting in the real Paris, not this cheap, hasty and full of clichés bad reconstruction).
At least, if Love had killed Joe to become the main protagonist of the show, what twist it would have made ! That alone would have redeemed the whole S3 for me....
He was the "accident" I was referring to. Although it was a murder, it was different from the rest he committed in season 1 because in season 1 the murders were done through attacks with the intent to kill. Here he pushed him down the stairs in a panic, which although is extremely overkill and definitely is murder, is less premeditated and intentional than his previous ones. Joe initially went to Henderson's house not to kill him but instead to force him to confess and to ruin his life. Season 1 Joe would never have done that and would have just went straight for the murder like he did for peach.
He didn’t deserve to die, joe justifies why he deserves to die and everything is from his perspective
yes but so is joe, that’s my point. it’s gross how the show is trying to make him the “hero” now and seemingly justifying his actions.
You need to optimize, bro!
Haha honestly I was so confused between the two after your comment that I had to google to figure it out 🥲
I don’t understand the weirdness around that scene. Literally the show was throwing in your face how deeply they connected are as twins. If you seriously got anything sexual out of that scene that is on you. I even saw someone argue its womb imagery (especially given the ep title) Could you not sit in a tub with your sibling and not have it be weird??
A PICKLE????
u fucked up in the head if you think he deserved to be put in the hospital for that,, I agree he was annoying at first but love lead him on
Deadass he was the least likeable character in the show for me.
Succession mad men the leftovers
Better Than Us.  It's Russian.  Very different but similar type of light drama, action, etc.
THANK YOU, it was killing me where I knew her from.
Yeah I am! Sorry I hope those weren't spoilers
I'm so convinced she's not actually dead
Nah she was getting annoying as fuck
Now that I have time to absorb it. I think it depends on what you watch this show for. If you set your expectations right, this could be a very entertaining show.

If you watch for Joe’s arc, s2 and s3 as a whole is his “growth” arc and is overall satisfying I suppose. But I do wonder where can you go from here and still make things fresh and interesting. It kind of gets old quickly.

If you watch for psychological thriller, s3 is quite disappointing. It’s more like the movie mr. and mrs. smith. Killing people is just a game now. Never worry about the police, leave a suicide note and they will believe whatever the note says. Impulsive killing and assaulting in broad daylight is just unrealistic. If there are no consequences for their actions, there are no stakes. 

If s2 gives you the impression that Love is the new main character and you want to see her arc in s3, then you are going to be hugely disappointed.

I think s3 made it clear that there always has been one main character, Joe. This show is his story, everyone else just pays rent to live in it.

Put s2 and s3 together, I think Love never had a chance to grow as character, she is set up to be a overprotective wanna-be mom and batshit insane impulsive killer. 

It didn’t make sense for me then because I think it’s too artificial, now I know why. The show runs on drama created by such artificial personalities, and imo is getting sloppy on remaining parts of the show. But man, watching Victoria Pedretti perform is pure joy. Her facial expressions in ep10 is god tier.

I was mixed with feelings after that ending. Kind of all the above. Can’t really go into details because I’m too lazy to mark spoilers lol.

Now a little better, because once I realized this is Joe’s show. This ending is inevitable. Also it helps that Victoria is so hot in s3, that I almost forgot what the plot is about haha.

Anyway, feel free to let off steam on me if needed. I need to talk to someone after every Victoria’s show on Netflix 😂
yeah the irony is real but… you know what i’m saying 🤣
This is spot on and I think he says this a few times. Also, he started to feel better when he was making friends
So spot on!! I see this in him too when he drops Henry off. He knows he does this and will ruin his life. He’s recognizing this in himself and truly puts Henry first.
True and that is also why Im not really keen on a S4
He's actually a slight subversion of the douchebro, though. He is proudly bisexual and enjoys a polygamous lifestyle with his wife and generallly supports her highly successful and focused career.
Sorry but what toxic masculinity? They went into the woods to cry and get in touch with themselves. What’s toxic about that? Seems like the opposite to me.
Lol
You mean how they left Henry with Dante and the babysitter for like 48 hours? They kept pawning him off on people for what felt like days at a time
Bringing that up again just to show he still sends money and such would be boring and would just mess with the story. I'm fine with believing he took care of those things off screen.
Paco wasn’t his blood, though. Joe’s father was an abusive, destructive man. Joe, despite his projected god complex, felt like a broken man. Having that lineage of f*cked up men didn’t appeal to Joe. Having a woman to protect was his m.o.
I agree that the boy vs girl baby plot was dumb, but Paco wasn't his kid. Paco was a kid next door in an awful situation that Joe could relate to and help, but there was no emotional investment that he'd had to parent this kid.
No not like that but who wants a parent who is obsessed with them and has no life of their own. He's such a horrible misogynistic that I bet if she's not pretty or doesn't like reading he'll drop all interest in her
I never understood how the cage could do any of its jobs with the air holes at the top?
The storage unit isn’t soundproof, just the cage.

But yeah the cage is pretty ridiculous in that it’s bulletproof and makes a literal gunshot sound like someone popping a piece of bubblegum. The whole idea was that it was supposed to be for storing rare books so why Moody make it bulletproof?
That was when their marriage truly began to crumble.
Same. Their relationship seemed untainted by her murderous ways.
Agreed.  The musical stans lost their shit over it before it even aired, and basically got it removed from existence.  And it is SO much truer to the movie and better than the musical.
LoL thanks for the correct perspective as a twin. Some answers reminds me of the arguments for Umbrella Academy’s sibling romance. As an adoptee I was like uh, *no* it doesn’t make a difference that they’re not related by blood, that’s their sibling!
...I didn’t say he can care for anyone? When I say ‘love’ I mean his version of it, which is really obsession born of narcissism.
Hoping against a S4
She's evil 😭😭
Ok will do, thanks !!!
Very good advice
Ok will do, thanks !!!
Very good advice
Joe deserved it though. he was being a total shithead towards love
Without reading the book it hard to understand. It not as much her personality. The book ending is very different, and maybe the story lead into the same thing, but it makes more sense
I'll spell it out then. The show was made worse by making their main female character be hysterical and unreasonable. She could've been written unstable and not be crazy woman #21056 in Hollywood.
I think Beck was a more boring character, but the relationship was more entertaining
No i think he makes it pretty entertaining
The new book he tries to woo his love interest without murder
Have you finished? He goes to France to find Marianne at the end..
exactly my thoughts, but how is season 4 going to be any different from season 3 if she's still alive. I just think that the writers kinda put themselves into a corner where joe and love can't co-exist anymore .
dw I was being sarcastic 😂
In season 3 Joe only killed Ryan and Love. Love killed and attacked more people.
I feel the same about wanting to see him explore this more, but I also thought having him slip back into the pattern is realistic. I personally had some seriously toxic relationships before seeking therapy (not murdering-people-toxic but still…), and I knew I had a pattern but I couldn’t stop myself from continuing what I was doing.  The damage was deep and it’s not a healthy brain thinking; the thoughts just aren’t logical.  So I thought having Joe return to the behavior was very realistic.
exactly! i got excited when he seemed to realize what he was doing with marianne but that all went out the window. it was so weird i thought the writers were punking us.
[deleted]
But he knew Love was the last one to see her at the Bakery, makes no sense that he wouldn't look at any other camera in the area... he had a definitive time & location but he just plays the same clip 300 times.

Meanwhile he finds a 2 second clip of Joe punching the wall in anger.
That’s what I’m hoping for, I thought this season would be trash but wholly enjoyed it. Writers know what they’re doing for sure
I'd take Love's impulsiveness over Joe's MO that is predictable and has been played out
Oh weird, do you have the app?
It only gets worse believe me.
Or >!he kills them!< because they love him for who he is. It's a huge flaw with the character. He doesn't make any sense! If all of this was for love it would be believable but clearly even once he has love, it's still not enough for him.
Thank you for saying this. As a non-murderer person diagnosed with EUBPD, it’s really shit when we see really really bad people from shows labelled with the disorders we’re professionally diagnosed with. <3
Lol, do tell me why these characters behave in such a way? 

I would like to hear your input instead of some reply giving me an impression that you know better than all of us.
From the Mayo Clinic: With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships.
it was an impulsive kill and she left joe to deal with the mess 💀 literally went over joe’s house later to comfort ellie about her missing sister even though she knew she killed her, didn’t drop a hint to joe that she was the one who killed her until candance locked him up. people are saying she’s impulsive and messy in this season when she was doing that shit in season 2
Well, he kinda did. At the end when he gave him up I could’ve sworn he said something like that.
i dunno about anyone else but i definitely felt the poison angle in the first flashback we see where her husband says he isn’t feeling good. I know he was also sick but I just got a vibe from the way Love was acting about it
Gil was Love thinking irrationally. In many ways, I'd equate it to Joe knocking out Will Bettelheim in Season 2. With Theo, it was the indication that Love made a clear choice at that point. She chose her family (Theo asked her to run away with him), and knocked him out. It's the idea of Sherry and Cary where it's kind of in the unknown. Both Joe and Love really had no idea how or if they would get out of there.
Oh, for sure Ryan's far worse than Natalie is. No doubt there. I was purely going on 'reasoning' versus who their characters are. Joe and Love's actions were both out of passion ultimately.
I felt more psychopath vibes from here to be honest. 

It made her precious murders before she even met Joe make sense. She literally killed two people (that we know of) lol
>I hate it when guys get the cool, calm and confident writing and women get the 'I cant control my emotions, irrational, insecure' writing. Its such a cliché.

So much this!

I was also over Love at the beginning of the season. Who goes killing a woman and then calls her husband to say that they need therapy? 🤡 A little too late at this point lol. 

During the whole season she was all the worst clichés about hysterical women. I am glad to know she won't be in season 4.
Everything def played a role in her being unable to control how much she revealed / how secretive she was.
I think this season love has been much more vilified. I've seen multiple people say that Joe always has a "justified reason" for his kills. 
However love has lost the one person who truly understood her as well. And she didn't become this way until she saw Joe was slipping away from her and since she knows him she knows that it's almost inevitable for him to leave her. 

But yeah I agree with the snarky thing. Like the missing white woman conversation was like???
I did some brief research on it after Season 1, apparently it is possible but very unlikely even in the best circumstances. 

Probably not something they could get from an open jar left on a shelf for days.
Ah thanks!
slashing his neck would mean physically restraining it, so love probably couldn't have if she wanted to
You’re right that Theo really just didn’t need to be there. His only purpose was to create suspense regarding whether Joe would find out and then when he did, nothing happened.
S4 Wishful Thinking: Theo becomes useful as the motivation for his step-dad to obsessively track down Joe in S4. Nathalie is gone but Theo survived and could be at risk. Meredith Grey’s boyfriend may expand the facial recognition program and find Joe in Paris pretty quick. 🤞

Edit: Removed inadvertent word
IMO Theo’s most important role was as Love’s victim that Joe chose to help. He was a loose end that he was in the middle of tying up and it would have been easier to just kill Theo but instead Joe risked his window of time to meet Marienne to drive him to the hospital. I think this will come back in S4 somehow.
A movie from the 2000's is... an old film? Fuck, I'm a dinosaur... lol
Please do update if by any chance you find the name of the movie.
If you happen to remember please update us
Urgh I wanna watch this movie now
Please do update if you find I want to see it too
I had a theory that since episode 6 is halfway through the season that Love’s inner monologue would continue as she progressively took over the “role” of the show, killing Joe at the end, then following her for season 4.
But she did go to the cops. They told her all they could do was have her get a restraining order because she "had no proof". Then the cop told her that her safest option was "staying dead" in Joe's eyes
This was a good example actually. Also Benji being dangerous for Beck when Joe ended up killing Beck. However, I was talking about the show after Love was introduced not what happened in season 1. The show made a point of Joe trying to change for the better and give up who he was in season 1. If you are clinging onto who Joe was in season 1 as your argument for him being just as bad if not worse than Love, then you are essentially ignoring all the character growth. He definitely had set backs and relapses but he was TRYING to be good. Love was not. I am sure Joe may have had some hypocritical moments in seasons 2&3 as well but most of season 3 was portraying love as a hypocrite. She was amazing in season 2 and y'all are still holding onto that same Love. That Love was an illusion the same way Joe being a chivalrous safe boyfriend was an illusion to all the girls before they found out the truth. Also, there wasn't "a few similar scenes" rewatch the show and you will see almost everything she does is hypocritical. The writers verbally express to us she's a hypocrite via Love's mom. I'm not arguing that Joe isn't guilty of hypocrisy per se but the person I responded too said, "His self awareness is zero and he takes the term hypocrisy to a whole new level." This is applies way more to Love (only in season 3). At least it was way more prevalent. It was MADE to be that way, keep in mind that JOE is the narrator. Consequently, Love's hypocrisy is way more apparent.
Oh no they’re both batshit insane, i’ll never argue against that.

I don’t think you can say that Joe gaslit Love. In S2 he really loved her, cared about her and saw her as the one. Only after he realized that Love had “lied” to him and she was also as insane as him did he lose interest, he didn’t gaslit her he just lost interest after getting to know the ‘real’ Love. 

From what i’ve seen most people on here hate Joe more thanks to the narration? It shows, to me, how hypocritical and out of his mind he is.
Just binged started season 3 but if you don’t mind spoiling when was Love gaslit?
Yeah also Love acts out on her emotions a lot more. Most of the deaths were caused by her irrational impulsiveness while Joe justifies it somehow (although in a twisted way) and his plans have some "advantage" for him. For Love though, it was just anger issues and her being pissed. All of the deaths she caused (other than Theo's attempted murder I guess) were very damaging to her family with 0 "benefit" whatsoever.
Legally speaking, crimes committed by people with anger issues are given less punishment than crimes planned in cold blood. So technically Joe is the bigger psycho.
I’m sure he thought he was being super normal when he was fishing one of Natalie’s used tampons out of her trash for his stalker box.
YES!! I'm praying that Matthew/Theo will be in the next season. I thought this season might end with Joe and Love hunting each other down, I thought that might make for an interesting S4. But since that's, uh, obviously not the case, I wanna see him hunted by Matthew
I watch w/ subtitles and he definitely said Nick.
Nah it shows someone, I think Theo,  open up a newspaper that says the literal words "husband wife murder suicide" in the headline with Joe and Love undersea.
It doesn’t directly have anything to do with you thinking them continuing therapy is unrealistic. My answer points out that realism is not the point of the show, so I gave you an example of how UNREALISTIC the show can be. Go argue under someone else’s post. This is my opinion so if you don’t agree, politely state that & move on! Instead of saying “y’all are so unrealistic”, you could’ve just said “that idea is unrealistic” or something of the sorts.
[deleted]
But I really think the point is that Joe isn't actually looking for love. He thinks it's love, and uses the claim of loving someone to justify his actions, but it's obsession, not love. That is his fatal flaw.
You’re hoping to see growth with stalkers/killers, there’s your first problem. That’s not the point or fun of this show.
I would say yes. There are literally no likeable characters in the books. Joe is emphatically way more psychotic. All the stuff that kind of softens his edges/makes him "sympathetic" on the show (Paco, Ellie)--that was all made up for the show. & there's no relief from him in the books. In the show, we get scenes he's not in, we get little breaks from his inner monologue. But the books are all Joe all the time, which is pretty unbearable. I'm of the opinion that he's not a likeable character in general & that people who are like, "Joe isn't all bad!" have just been hypnotized by Penn Badgley's cheekbones, but he is seriously twenty times worse in the books--really hateful & misogynist. & the stories in general are just more far-fetched & have a looser relationship with reality. Caroline Kepnes just isn't a great writer.
Yeah, after reading that Book 3 synopsis, I think I know why the writers changed things. Way too many deaths and killing going on for only 10 episodes for Season 3. 

While Season 3 did have bland parts involving Marienne, I'm also glad they didn't follow that batshit crazy Soap Opera storyline in Book 3.
The answer is yes to your question about book 3
Oh, I forgot to mention: in the books, Love isn’t a murderer. & when she finds out that Joe is, she turns him in. The second book ends with him in jail. It’s vague as to how he gets off. The allusion is that Love learns she’s pregnant after Joe is arrested & her family cuts a deal to have Joe released & essentially disappeared (he’s using a new name in the third book) in exchange for him never contacting Love or the baby. Their thinking is that they don’t want the publicity of the public knowing Love is pregnant by a serial killer. Like I said, the books aren’t great.
Joe was the one being hypocritical. When he murders it's okay but when she does she's a monster.
I couldn’t agree more. She was getting so messy and playing the victim when majority of the mess was HERS and then she’d make Joe take care of everything. I felt exhausted with her and was begging for Joe to put her down. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
God i hope they don’t ruin it just to milk the fame
Yeah true 😂 Or anything from Reputation, probably Look What You Made Me Do lol
The whole album is a work of art 👌
They probably get guys to do the physical jobs and be the passive aggressors. Just a speculation 🤷🏻‍♂️
I did enjoy the campiness and dark humor this season a lot, like the argument when Love was pissed that Joe was killing for some other woman instead of killing for her.
Fuck that I hoped they all died lmao
Sheesh okay. I think I would like that ending better. Thx for replying.
I only just saw this comment but I wanted to add 2 points to cast this in doubt:

- She brings up midseason that she remembered that Joe lunged at her in the cage in season 2. She knew Joe well enough to drug the knife or whatever. She was well aware of the risk of Joe. She hid a key for the cage. It's not entirely unbelievable that she could have anticipated this, it would be convoluted in most cases so it would be really difficult to write well.

- A girlfriend has already "come back from the dead" so both the plotline is available for re-use if this is a common thing they do (reuse stuff) and it would play so well into the hands of a redemption arc for her. Some big moment where she has a monologue along the lines of "You were so focused on yourself that you forgot about me" something something Joe isn't as smart as he thinks he is, doesn't reflect on his past or his actions. She could reference Candice. 

I think it's possible.
But Love isn't diagnosed with BPD and it's not mentioned in the show at all. Probably to avoid further stigmatizing it and portraying them as psychopaths. If she was, she'd be one of the only mainstream characters I can think of with it. If that was someone's only exposure to BPD then it could cause discrimination and a further misunderstanding of the disorder. 

Autism is at a point where it's gotten a lot more representation, and they don't have to be saints of characters, but playing into stereotypes doesn't help the autistic community. "You should avoid the internet" I'm not triggered by anything here, maybe a bit defensive but I don't see why me disagreeing with you makes me unfit for the internet lmao, it's a big place I think I'll stay.
Thank you. People hate on Beck but she was realistic and had problems hopes dreams was writing intelligent tried to fit in but wasn't OTT. Had actual chemistry.
>based on the little information given, that I excuse his actions and actively root for him.


You mean the obviously contradictory information from multiple paragraphs in this thread from you, all to prop up the idea that Love is somehow particularly worse than Joe? 


>it’s quite literally a television show that intentionally tries to make you see such a terrible person in a good light


So your reasoning for being illogically defensive of Joe is that you believe the TV show told you, like you can't form your own individual thoughts outside the ones Joe's inner monologue tells you? Its like you haven't seen any television show or film that has a protagonist who isn't a good person. 


>And key-word: “in a sense”.  You’re once again taking my words extremely literally


There's nothing from Love's dialogue or even Forty's in S2 that can be recontextualised as "I was holding you back from killing people sis". You quite literally just made something up to prop up the whole "Love makes Joe more sympathetic" standpoint you have - which you still can't even defend.


>but MY interpretation was that Forty was not enabling her behavior by hiding bodies and treating it like it was normal.


Here's the key word: dissuade. As in, literally persuade someone to not do something. How is doing nothing the same as persuading someone? And you're somehow acting like this statement means anything after adding "in a sense"? You just sound like you're waffling to be honest. By your own logic everyone in Love's life has dissuaded her "in a sense" from her murderous tendencies by not being involved. So basically a redundant statement. You really tried to do a basic contrasting thing with the whole "Joe enables her and Forty dissuades her" just to seem smarter while propping up the lazy narrative of "Joe sympathetic Love evil". 


I'll just leave this as the last reply since I've already addressed all your points, and after the not-so-subtle fact that the comment of mine above just happens to be sitting on 0 points, on a thread 4 days old and located pretty deep in a chain of comments that hasn't been seen by anyone outside of us as of recent. Baaaaasically I'm getting at the fact that you're immature enough to downvote a reply - giving value to literal internet brownie points - rather than actually tackle any of my main points. And that fact, funnily enough, pretty much confirms you *are* in fact a Joe stan, since no one pointlessly downvotes on a comment no one but two people will see for no real reason at all. Feels good when you catch someone out for doing something that petty but pretends to be mature in the comments ;)
Which is the problem...Joe and Marianne had so little screen time that it never seemed believable.
Well, im glad you enjoyed it! 

If you into that typa thing there’s an author called Samantha Downing who writes similar books

My Lovely Wife is a book about serial killing couples much like joe and love 

It’s absurd and I hated it but people seem to love it so there you go
your username has me cackling,  i love that show
How does he have no development?
Anyone who likes Joe has an unhealthy attraction to psychopaths. I’m not supposed to like Joe he’s a terrible person and so was love. You don’t like these people you enjoy the storyline and the character development Joe has ZERO character development leading us to same fucking storyline we’ve been watching which is growing stale and stagnant.
Lol no need to take it personally. 🙂
I agree. She was far more unhinged than before and I wish the writers hadn’t done that. I also struggled with both of their infidelity during the season. Though, for joe needing an obsession it made sense but for her it just didn’t. She loved HARD and someone with that level of commitment and longing for a nice little family wouldn’t have the urge to cheat. I get that Theo was needy and innocent and broken and reminded her of fourty so she was drawn to him but it still just felt like many of their choices for her character were off. 

I should have said that I wish the version of love from season 2, continued on in season 3 and then replaced joe lol
Also, to be fair I feel like her antivax reaction was representative of how I would have wanted to react if I was in her shoes. I’ve never hit anyone in my life and have also never murdered lol but I would have slapped or punched that man.
You’re right. I just read the interview Victoria Pedretti did and she confirmed Love is dead. Sucks
Yeah and not in your "classically good looking way" more in a very intense, chaotically good, intelligent way.
She killed her ex-husband from before she even knew Joe. She killed Natalie. Thought she killed Theo and wanted the couple dead too. Joe let them all live.
np! yeah it felt so forced. i didn't see the chemistry at all with marienne, heck natalie and him had more chemistry and she was only onscreen with him for what, 20 mins max? i hope they don't have him jumping all over the place next season
I’m not in the level of pain I was last year but it definitely still hurts and I dreamt about her last night after finishing the show
No...? Nothing can justify killing someone??? lmao what are you on. I think you're not understanding that even if that part was "an accident", she still wanted to have the paralyzed ex husband with her. Paralyzing someone's body to force them to be with you forever. HOW does that sound better than "accidentally killing him" and how is that justified? And how could her ex kill people? I'm lost here. 

Also you're missing the point that Love wasn't faithful either. You can't give me the loyal partner argument only to validate Love's murders? This whole idea that it's okay that Love killed people and that it's all justified (only for her) sounds crazy to me.
I liked that she was a garbage person haha, but I hear you

Edit: actually, it is pretty funny to consider how anticlimactic that was. I remember the intense speculation, including people thinking it might be Joe’s mom 😂
why do you know so much 🤨
Yeah definitely cus he and beck didn’t know each other as well
I don't care, they were quite woke elements in the show
We all have our own opinions. Agree to disagree 🤷🏻‍♀️
Do you see the problem? There’s historical context as to why these two instances are not comparable. But I won’t waste my time going back and forth, so I will simply say you’re being racially insensitive and ignorant
They could’ve went a million more logical ways.  I understand how radical Reddit is about vaccines.  I work in healthcare and have every vaccine up to date.  I understand they save lives.  But in a TV show like You it made zero sense.  They literally say anti vax on the show.  It was a ridiculous side show just so the writers can force a message that felt extremely out of place from the previous seasons.
I agree getting those various vaccines are different.  They mentioned masks and everything in an earlier episode, so the show is based in covid times.  To have a vaccine based plot line like the one in the show would be one crazy coincidence.  I think it’s fairly clear they’re trying to prove a point, and I just think it’s unnecessary and takes away from the show.  Covid stuff is everywhere, I’d just like to watch a show, ya know
That doesn’t make any sense. Comparing the gap between a 40 and 50 year old is much different than a 19 and 25 year old. It’s predatory. Saying it’s not is only contributing to the sexualization of minors. A normal 25 year old would not have sex with a 19 year old. A 19 year olds brain hasn’t even fully developed yet. 19 year olds look like miniature adults not adults, as tv might lead you to believe. Wouldn’t you find it predatory if your husband was attracted to a 25 year old girl? A 19 year old girl? Where the hell do you draw the line?
Well, my statement is only retracted of it is a post covid world because then masks wouldn't be needed for that reason.
I agree with this, but she never did the "crazed mother" thing. She supposedly killed herself and Joe without trying to get her baby back. The only thing that makes sense is she was okay with giving up Henry but wanted to end her and Joe's life. So maybe I'll just assume that was Joe's intent all along.
Yea me too. Joe definitely has a pattern and obviously is gonna repeat history in Paris to find Marianne but I think it’s stretching the show. Should have ended it at 3
Yeah I didn’t even pick up on any of this lol
Uh we love a Hannah McKay
Dexter definitely! He only cleaned up or took out the trash 🗑 when the rest of the city was oblivious to what was going on… I loved that show. 
Are you going to be checking out the new season? I’m going to check it out because I’m a big fan of the show. Just curious with the passing of time how well the writing will be…
Omg I was freaking out expecting this too
I thought she was already dead! Amazing she walked away unscathed.
I thought she killed Henry and was going to present him to Joe in a baking dish to punish him
You're 100% right with Marienne and told her to listen to that voice inside of herself she finally did
That was my thought he could of played it of like I just wanted more chicken
I think the adrenaline was the antidote which is why we wasn’t paralyzed as long as she thought he would be. But she did the dose “right” this time so he would only be paralyzed.
But love said she wasn’t going to kill him with it this time, I thought, then she went to cut his throat to kill him. So I don’t think the stuff he touched on the knife was gonna kill him regardless
I just wish Love made it to the next season lol
Nailed it.
This. One more season where he dies or gets caught. Actually I would be open to him being caught and then a few episodes where he actually needs to face all his crimes through a trial or investigation… if it were done right. Maybe bring back characters from previous seasons as witnesses.
Yeah actually that’s a good point. I just hope you’re right. I don’t want another season of him doing the same thing. I’d like for him to be caught I think.
Glutathione\*
Power of Love*
Immortality wasted on the youth
Isn't that the whole running theme? Joe is right to that extent, he does try to plan out his kills while Love kills in passionate fits. She never thinks about the after, and something as simple as checking if your victim is actually dead never crosses her mind.
I mean it's protocol to leave the hospital in a wheelchair but he still seemed pretty fucked up nonetheless.
Oh my god I love this 😂😂😂. I'm really glad that likeable characters like himself weren't just killed off for the sake of it.
Just because you would be surprised by what people can survive does not mean you can’t be surprised by what can kill them. People have survived gunshots to the head while others die from hitting their head from a fall in the shower. Truth can be stranger than fiction.
[deleted]
Hendy hit his head against a foundational basement wall, I.e. concrete, stone or brick. Game over.
I don't think Natalie bled out. IIRC she had her throat slashed no? So the cause of death would've been related to not being able to breathe.
I've only been here once. Five comments the day I saw S3.

I'd hardly call that being "all over this sub.  Bro. 🙄
I totally agree. This whole season Joe's storyline has started to feel repetitive and and boring tbh. I wanted >!him to get caught or for Love to kill him but neither of those things happened!<.
Yeah but Love also >!blamed Joe for the murders she committed even though she murdered people well before him, on top of having an affair with Theo while getting upset that Joe was getting obsessed with another woman!<, so Love doesn’t self reflect or learn, either. They’re both insane.
She came out swinging in szn 3 that’s for sure .
Now whenever I see her in anything, >!I'm going to expect her to die!<
This reminds me of the fact that in the Gabby Petito case, there was literally a BODY found in the dumpster of a Walmart, where police had been given a tip that Brian Laundrie had been spotted.  I can't tell you who it was, why the person died, or how they ended up in a dumpster -- the only interest the media had in it was that it was a false alarm -- unrelated to Gabby's death.  It's like... ok... but it's still a person.  Why don't we care about HIM too?
I promise you, bias reporting is a thing in every country.
Yeah missing white woman syndrome has been going on for decades if not hundreds of years in the US. It's nothing to do with Gabby petito
It's mostly America. We don't have that kind of thing in Asian countries.
Why does there have to be an agenda every time a person of color is seen in a positive light? The actress is younger than most everyone on set and very beautiful. The type dangerous men like Joe pray on. skin tone doesn't seem to be a focal point, except in that one conversation.
What’s being careful with a DEADLY virus on the loose!!
some of that can be explained away by white male privilege but in a town like madre linda that seems to be 90% white its not as easy to accept. what was the whole point of the cop in season 1 if literally nothing happens to joe? every time he gets in a “jam” i don’t even sweat it because i know it will be resolved in an episode or 2 lol.
it must be for the penn b softcore porn. i thought he was hot before but this show ruined him for me. 😂
The same. I hope she's gone from next season. Also she doesn't have charisma at all.
Henry cried waaaayyyyyyyyy too much. Had to decrease the volume and throw on the sub-titles a LOT! (yes, I get it, you have a newborn waaahhahaHAHAHAAHAhahahhhh)
Accomplished
Yeah S1 had the hipster shit down pat. I live in NYC and we dislike all those people lol.
They probably started to become friends when Theo verbally attacked Sherry, and Love got him stop. Sherry sent those flowers over the next day!
True power couple 😂
These two (and Theo) were really scene stealers!
That was hilarious. And also when he did the fake hello to Love from inside the cage. Best character in the season by far
I was VERYYY impressed with how Sherry immediately stopped once consent was withdrawn, even if it was painful for her 😂
When she said I'm okay...I felt that
How in the fuck did Cary become likeable?
She was one of the best actresses I have ever seen. So raw and powerful in the cage!!!
She KILLED IT on Search Party.  I was so excited to see that she was on You.
She was the best part of Search Party S3
**Marienne
Speaking of the real Will Bettelheim, I wonder if he'll come back
In NYC, if he was there for awhile, he might not have payed much. By not much, maybe 1500 lol
Urban schools have tons of living spaces.
Yeah I'm jusy saying their house and cars are probably paid for. So he can't just use the book money to give to ellie.
They say in one of the episodes the Love’s bakery is this huge success, idk how believable that is given she was the only one that worked there but who knows
Just finished binging from 5pm-3am too! 😬 multiverse??
No, he is me. I am you
Yeah good point. I forgot about that.
oh I must've missed that
I've literally watched the show twice and never realized that lol
I don't understand how Theo's dad didn't think to check any other camera in the area when Natalie was at Love's bakery.
That’s not what the majority of the world would’ve done. I don’t know what else to say.
They are not in Los Angeles anymore in Season 3. Love’s family doesn’t control the whole country’s PD, just LA.
All good points. Simply put Joe has plot armor because without him running free there would be no show.
Hahaha. Some kiwiness just leaking through. Glad you appreciate it.
Bro what-
he’s a literal stalker and murderer. tf is wrong with you? literally nothing he does is justified. what about paco? ellie? the real will? beck? peach? benji? candace? her coworker? HIS BABY that he literally abandoned and stopped giving a shit about months prior to that? you have some serious issues if you don’t think joe is a bad guy. 🚩 🚩🚩 all over
Good bot.
Could you share? I'm so curious since it's always negative so it would be refreshing to see what you did like about her / the experience
Yes.
Maybe you would if >!your baby caught something from the anti-vaxxers and almost died like Henry 😫!< Not condoning Love’s actions, but I TOTALLY understood her feelings of hate and rage over that…incident lol.
Where is it? Or where is it supposed to be?
Which is why it was so depressing and frustrating to see the general public refuse to mask up, vaccinate, social distance etc. They interviews this idiotic family who thought it was a hoax and they had their family reunion instead of scheduling it later and they all got COVID. The saddest thing was the pregnant 25 yo. She ended up on life support and when they interviewed her doctor, he was getting choked
Up, almost in tears. The stupid mother is babbling on about how they were just like everyone else in their belief it was a hoax. Unbelievable
Honestly Love's hiding place was worse. Desperate people locked in a cage 24/7 for days are gonna find that key way more easily.
homegirl put it bare ass and in the first canister on that shelf. The first row!
I fucking cackled at that too. Like poor choice of words Joe. Hey blind man will you watch my child? Like fucking hell Joe. You could have said babysit or something.
[deleted]
Very interesting!

I haven't read the books yet. I said I would do it when the series ended but it's still going on strong so maybe I will read them before Season 4 is out, just to compare.
? Laurence Fishbourne was 30 and Cuba Gooding Jr was 23 when Boyz In The Hood came out...
Wow you’re so wrong
Pretty sure Laurence Fishbourne was in Apocalypse Now! He’s been around forever.
Good bot
LOL!
Nice
Same here! Team comfort
[deleted]
Completely agree with this
I agree, he should die or be jailed in season 4
It seemed like the note to Dante was from Joe. I assumed he wrote in a "I sense I'm going to be killed soon" frame of mind. 

Maybe they will clarify next season.

If he finds Marienne, I have no idea how he'll explain it to her, but I see no way that she wouldn't be terrified of him, no matter what tale he spins. I sort of hope he never finds her. 

That might be anticlimactic, so I think he will find another You before he finds Marienne, and he might run into his mother and have subplots to do with that.
See that's where I have a major disagreement. Joe did start evaluating his behavior and exploring the origin of his obsessions, but this exploration and awareness led to absolutely nothing. Joe realized he has mommy issues and this was his cause for being attracted and obsessed with Marienne. Then he threw this revelation to the side and "You'd" Marienne. I agree that he did grow, but for about a fraction of a second. Then he reverted back to normal Joe going into his old ways. 

I'm all for characters taking a step back and not always improving, that's okay because that's more realistic than always getting better. However with Joe essentially cracking the code to his behavior and understanding why he does what he does, and then still buying into said behavior. That is not what people do. He should at least struggle with the thought. But nope, he throws all this info to the side and disregarded any real character growth. Obviously this is all subjective so I respect the way you see him as a character and how you feel about his development. I'm just personally disappointed this is the direction the writers decided to go in and it had left me rooting against Joe at this point.
I just want to point out that while he didnt take any keepsake from Marienne, he did keep souvenirs or whatever from all the people that he/Love killed.... Like Natalie's teeth, Gil's driver's license, etc.
The only reason he didn’t take a keepsake from Marienne was because he didn’t want to have anything tangible Love could find and grow suspicious, because he was worried she would kill Marienne if she found out. (Joe said this himself)
Joe ain’t justify shit I’m watching what was happening to marriane or however you spell her name. He was doing her so dirty for no reason.
Well I think the show favours joe because he’s the protagonist, and the show definitely shows the hypocrisy of both. There’s a lot of dialogue where joe is making it seem as if he’s in a relationship with a crazy person that’s obviously a bit tongue-in-cheek and supposed to sound hypocritical. I mean, you’re in his head, he’s obviously going to think he’s better than her for the way in which he kills. If we were in her head we’d probably get her telling the audience how much of a creep joe is, which the show demonstrates more than enough anyway (the stalking, creepy masturbating, keeping someone’s tampon, stealing panties etc)
Uh... no? I definitely could not sit in a tub with my sibling and have it not be weird. That would be weird beyond fucking belief.
a picke theo
Didn't love make it clear to him that he needs to stop hitting on/ flirting with her? Multiple times before their first "in the woods" sexual escapade? Pretty sure that was the opposite of "leading him on"...
what no I really liked him he was the least likable because he was the most realistic let's face it in this show...he was a college kid who needed help and has his stepmom get murdered and looked for love (literally) from whoever would give him attention
Same. Plus the bad acting and the no chemistry
He set the house on fire. Pretty sure she’s dead.
So Pedretti said as far as she’s concerned Love is dead, BUT she said she would be 100% down to do more, whether it’s figments of Joe’s imagination like Beck or alive like Candace (which leads me to believe she doesn’t know what happens next which makes sense)
Totally! I don’t believe Love is dead either. It’s like with Candace - unless there’s a physical blood-stab-murder scene we can’t be sure.
I was rolling my eyes so much with her. So frustrating lol
Agree. I was over her
Lmao you are so on point it's actually amazing that i share the same thoughts and feelings with you about the s3, i was expecting that the love affair of Joe and Love will continue, welp with some barracades in between. I was merely dissappointed in Love dying, it could've been made so that both live and make the story somehow mysterious about s4. Although everything that happened the twists/transition from s2 to s3 are dissappointing as well if not more, I didn't understand the part where Joe manages to psychotically fall for one woman after his marrage, the lady dies, then he falls back to Love, he quits again and falls to a lady in a Book Store or whatever, it's somewhat not logical he is to be blamed for the distortion of his family, meanwhile Love tryed to protect her family at costs but wasn't sure whether she should fuck the neighbour teenager or not (which she did twice for no fookin reason claiming she loved joe and her son). In conclusion it's their fault for all that happened, but it's really a bit shitty that there's basically no continuing from s2 to s3 in a good Transition where they function as a perfect family and then things get sloppy between them and they slip up, Joe is not feeling Love from the first fucking episode which is again - not logical. Victoria is amazing tho she leaves a person with a lot of emotions and an open jaw with her performance, which is leading to fans wanting more in the future.
Lol yea
Yes, and he proudly admits his wife is smarter then him. He turned out to be the exact opposite of his persona. I really liked the juxtaposition of their relationship with Joe and Love’s. Despite appearances as Joe said they brought the best out in each other.
That doesn't dissolve the rest of his toxic masculinity.
The whole "be a man, kill a squirrel" "come on, fight me" part
[deleted]
Right?!? I get it bc child labor laws, but it was definitely jarring to come out of the measles episode and not even see the kid for most of the season
Joe did same thing 
When his mom did to his 
I felt like shit man the only hope was that child
Well what is the significance of the child's sex in terms of Joe's blood? If Joe became a fucked up abusive father would that affect his son more than a daughter? Children are children.
He won’t care if his daughter is pretty because he wants to protect her. It seems like you think his obsession with his daughter will be the same as women he encounters
Is he a misogynist? I don’t think simply having murdered some women makes you a misogynist.
Yeah, all it would take is for Delilah or that hacker guy to scream at the top of their lungs and someone should eventually hear them. Joe is gone for such a long time anyways, and definitely isn't there late at night since he's sleeping.

The Mooney's bookstore basement may have been soundproof (why they would have that feature in a bookstore, I have no idea), but the storage place in Season 2 definitely was not.
He was worried they’d try to kill the books
Because we see her perspective of it. Same way joe doesn’t seem that bad because we look thru his eyes
It was an interesting Rorsach test. Mainstream audiences thought it looked too woke and the Twittati thought it had right-wing leanings because the Heathers were queer outsiders. No one gave it a chance and it ended up being one of the most intelligent, insightful, and biting teen shows I’ve ever seen. 

It’s a shame that it’s still near impossible to find the finale and that we never got the French Revolution themed second season they had planned.
I agree, but then what's the point in watching more if that's all it is? It's like counting up to 10 (literally 10 episodes) and then restarting at 1. Incredibly unsatisfying seeing Joe's Yin lose it's fucking Yang for like the 3rd time. At least Love made sense as she's also a psychotic murderer too.
It’s a TV show character. Not an actual murderer. 🤦🏼‍♀️
So is he
They were both terrible to each other
joe did not deserve to die any more than love did
Ehhh she went all crazy because she found out he was cheating on her. Yet she was doing the same thing. Everything he had done she had also done. The ultimate hypocrite.
And so did love. Which is exactly the point. They deserve each other, the good and (especially) the bad
To be fair, I feel like they gave plenty of plot reasons for Love's behavior. Love has always impulsive, but now she is grieving the loss of her twin brothers and by association the loss of her whole identity of protective big sister. Not to mention sleep deprivation and possible post-partum depression from her newborn.
Not a fair comparison considering it was more about Joe and Love, Marianne was barely with Joe.

and "sob story" when Marianne's own is more realistic especially with those who deal with disparities within the justice system meanwhile we had spoilt brat Beck whining about her dad who paid her to attend festivals with him, not to mention  paid her rent and furnishings.
That’s a good point.
This. I commented above too, but mental illness doesn't just go away because you identified it and know it's not healthy. Just like identifying a tumor as the source of your symptoms doesn't make cancer go away. It takes real time and effort and therapy, and even then some people's "best" will be learning to manage symptoms, not eliminating them. As someone who struggles with mental health, I thought Joe going back and forth about his own was very realistic.
That is weird you doesn't understand it if you are a therapist. I'm not saying every person will act like Joe, but someone with such a profound wound will. Also, I hope you don't call your patients' reactions stupid or absurd when they don't align with "logic".

How on earth is it so highly rated?  Why do people like it so much?  This shit is hot garbage compared to the first two seasons but you’d have no idea from reading the reviews.

Edit: I finished it and it gets a bit better.  Still easily the worst season of You.  Like a 6/10 overall with some good highlights.
Welcome! While I don't have BPD, ( I have other mental health struggles) I have friends with BPD, it's frustrating to see the continued false narrative around those who have BPD and mental health issues in general! All these people thinking they can diagnose a fictional character via web M.D etc is ridiculous and BPD has sadly become somewhat of a catch-all on the internet.
I'm not here to explain a character's motivation to you, nor do I need to. 

Are you a medical professional who practices psychology or psychology, or a professor that teaches it? As much as I hate to make presumptions, it's quite likely do not have any experience on an academic or medical level. As someone who has actually studied psychology, I would have a better understanding compared to you who just knows how to regurgitate what they google. 

You can go back to your cave now troll.
 Once again, Love is a fictional character who has no canon diagnosis. Just because you can Google various mental health issues and personality disorders doesn't correlate to a real life diagnosis. But, go ahead and list every possible signifier in the DSM-V while you're at it!
I 100% agree that Love kills impulsively and doesn’t think of what happens after. That doesn’t change the fact that she killed Delilah with clear intention - to protect Joe and her future family. You said she killed her simply because she was jealous which isn’t really true. I also think she killed Natalie not only out of jealousy but again, to protect her family from being destroyed by Joe’s obsession with her.
>Gil was Love thinking irrationally.

When was she not lol? None of her murders were calculated. 

Natalie's murder wasn't calculated. It's kind of the worst idea to kill someone at a location you just bought from them. I have no idea why the police never seemed to be interested in visiting the bakery when it was the last place Nathalie was seen alive (a video of a car doesn't really count to me). 

I understand why Theo's attempted murder was justified in her eyes. He knew. But she didn't even made sure that Theo was dead and just waited for Joe clean up her mess. 

> It's the idea of Sherry and Cary where it's kind of in the unknown.

I agree. But she was clearly open to the idea and not too bothered. She sort of sees those activities as bonding activities by then. That is what makes her so crazy and awful to watch. It goes from justifying murder (with Joe) to embrassing their nature and bonding over murder and murder related activities (with Love). 

I'm not trying to decide who is the best or the worst murder here. I'm just saying she was very open to the idea of killing during this season with no regards to the consequences. More than Joe. But being open at all to this idea is an issue, no matter the degree.
No. Joe did that because he needed his identity not out of emotion. He also set him free on his own. Love wanted to kill Gil but Joe stayed her hand in hopes of finding a different solution.
Thats true. I didnt even now how secretive she was until I heard she wont tell Joe where Candace and Delilah's bodies are
The missing white woman conversation is one that isn’t so much snarky as it is, people calling out an unfair phenomenon that they consistently witness.
I don’t understand people thinking Joe is an any way “better” than Love. In the end he decides to kill her or part ways with her once he knows he can be with Marianne… he always kills people in his way,  he just makes excuses for it.
...however, at least fingerprints would be likely off the jar. Not to mention his blood appears at what, a dozen crime scenes by now?

Something about 'You' is that you have to kind of suspend a lot of conventional forensic thinking.

The more you think about it: if Joe can stand in front of the cage and hear his victims talk, you're telling me a thin old wooden door from the bookstore in S1 would keep customers from hearing them scream? Security and cameras at the storage facility? It's like nobody in the world Joe lives in is doing their jobs, at all. lol.
I wanted this to be the last season. Not because I hated the show but because I really feel like they both deserved to be caught, they don’t deserve any happy endings. I was rooting against them every step of the way. 

I was hoping the narration from Love would be an indicator of what kind of person it took to kill Joe, and then show us that she is too impulsive to do it cleanly and thus gets caught doing it. I was really hoping it would be Theo that catches her too.
We can agree to disagree on the gaslighting argument, it’s a bit difficult to make that point given all of the unreliable narration, manipulation, and serial killing in the show. 

I think the writers might be intentionally have been trying to stoke a bit of Joe hate this season in a reaction to viewers, especially young viewers, idealizing his behavior (stalking is romance!) Season 1 and, to a lesser extent, 2, he was much more likable.
Joe was pretending that he cared for her and pretending that everything was fine in their marriage was gaslighting. All her anxieties and fears about their relationship weren’t just anxieties and fear— he just wanted her to think that they were, so that he could play on her insecurities and pursue his next target. 

When she’s trying to ~spice up their marriage~ etc... I just can’t think of anything more humiliating than his inner monologue as a reaction. She felt suspicious for a reason, and he did everything in his power to make her feel like it was all in her head.

Neither is a good person or better than the other IMO, both deeply dysfunctional and manipulative.
Joe at several points quite literally discusses how he knows she's suspicious of him, that her suspicions are correct, but that he's going to keep lying to and deceiving her in order to make her believe everything is okay and that her suspicions are wrong while he plans his exit from the marriage.
Yeah I remember that part. Idk, it’s Netflix man they always find a way
exactly! so why do you say the paralytic twist felt forced?
that settles it, not reading them. joe's monologuing was great and intriguing in s1, ok in season 2, and a straight parody in s3 (the amount of times he says You deadass feels like it came from the memes made about the show)
It is the cheek bones 😂
I don’t understand if it’s so different from the books why did they even base it off of them. They had to pay this author money I imagine.
honestly surprised they could spin s1 and s2 out of this. good job, writers
Love 100% went off the rails though. Joe was atleast semi calculated in his murders and was doing his best not to kill anyone. In all of season 3 Joe only killed 1 person, while love was busy being reckless and impulsive. I mean love legit murdered or was responsible for the murder/kidnapping of everyone in the season except Ryan. Joe kissed Natalie sure, but live was fucking Theo and if Love even thought Joe was thinking (obsessing sure, but still)  about another woman she would literally try to murder them. Love was unhinged, Joe was calm. Love was constantly putting both of them in danger with her impulsive actions. Love lacked any sense of self awareness and constantly blamed others for her actions. She killed Natalie and blamed Joe for kissing and obsessing over her. Throughout the whole season she did nothing but blame shift, and gaslight. Joe had his moments and quips of hypocricy here and there, but love was something else.
Loves also just psychotic while Joe is just a sociopath and obsessive.
Yeah like a few episodes in she’s already killed Natalie and held Gil hostage. Then they go to therapy but she has a crush on the next door teenager. Aaaand then she goes on to suggest a foursome to save the marriage which I have no clue how that would work given she’s actually quite possessive over Joe? But honestly she was really good throughout the season, without her character it might not have been as interesting
I completely agree. She made it more interesting sure. Doesnt mean she was annoying af.
Don't Blame Me and I Did Something Bad would fit so good as well
I really hope Love comes back and the intro is Look What You Made Me Do 😭
I DON'T TRUST NOBODY AND NOBODY TRUSTS ME 

ILL BE THE ACTRESS STARRING IN YOUR BAD DREAMS!! 

we never got Love's badass scene with the bridge :(
I mean, considering the fact that men do more physical and sexual violence than women by a huge margin, I don’t think this is likely. Especially when most of that violence is done *to* women, and those women are often their romantic partners.
Same. What a shit season and shit characters
If you have BPD, I think you should know what part of her behavior links to mental illness. The author can choose to mention details or not. 

Yeah, she kills people and might have BPD. So, people have to assume BPD people kills everyone? You don’t decide for others on how they perceive others. There are people who can and can’t understand about mental illness.

Your first reply suggests you are very defensive.

“Hi please don't push shitty stigmas on people with BPD”

“it's annoying being compared to a literal murdering psychopath because I was also neglected as a child!”

Fyi, you are not the only one with issues. So, don’t try to act self-entitled even you have mental illness.
Wooo, someone’s mad. Alright. I didn’t read the entire paragraph. I’m not really in the mood to have a back-and-forth over some innocent comments I made on a discussion post. I’m sorry that I upset you this much, though. Hope you have a fabulous rest of your day/night! :)<3
I agree with you, I think what makes it more connectable is when there is "realness" about it..
Joe killed the librarians ex. They are both crazy but one could of been stopped if joe would have just been loyal
Agree Natalie and him had a thing going on. I don’t have much hopes for the next season tbh. Should have kept love alive, VP has killed that role.
Life goes on moving on is the best thing to do right now she ain’t coming back :(( i feel ya on this one man
So we’re dealing with 2 messed up individuals but Joe is the one that you want to live. The one that’s killed more people that I can count on one hand? The one that traps people in a container? Ok. So what do you know about James prior to him having cancer? Love didn’t want to kill James. Love didn’t want James to leave her. Love wanted to take care of James for the rest of his life. But this is somehow worse than Joe killing people that’s in his way of the girl he wants. And Love was very much faithful up until Joe met Natalie. The only reason she cheated on Joe was because Theo saw her in a totally different light ( similar to Joe in S2) than Joe did. Theo made Love feel good.
LOL hope you don’t have access to all cameras in my city ;)
>they were quite woke elements in the show

you don't care about the fact that all the' woke elements' were literally there to be made fun of ? Do you just get mad at the mere mention of such things ? Imagine being this sensitive
lmao "racially insensitive and ignorant" so you spew your projecting bs and leave? Yep typical. They are comparable, you just think racism against white people can't happen. Go be a moron elsewhere kiddo. Your name checks out.
Each to their own opinion. It didnt phase me that they chose to make a statement about anti vaxx/pro vaccinations.
But to say the plot didnt go anywhere isn't true (referring to the person I was originally replying to).
fax
I would assume that joe would’ve played it that he got the baby to safety and she went full throttle on him. She was angry for taking her kid and murder -suicided them both.
Agreed. It’s a stretch but I hope Love is still alive and gives him what he deserves
Yep! It’s my favorite show. They are bringing back the original show runner of the first four seasons, so hopefully he does it justice. If you like these two shows you should also check out the Hannibal TV show if you haven’t, it’s also pretty fantastic.
It’s because the actress felt it was wrong for a black woman to die over being Joe’s obsession. She said it in her zoom interview 🥴
I feel like that’s a line the producers wouldn’t cross. They won’t kill any children in the show
Christ alive
Yea like becks friends , Ellie , loves friends and Theo
I have got to get to one of those IV bars asap who knew indestructibility was only $300 away
No, he definitely can’t walk. I’m watching the last episode as I type this and the part where Theo’s dad wheels him away from the hospital literally just played. Theo said to his father, “I managed to walk 75 meters today with some intermittent dancing,” so he’s definitely still stuck in a wheelchair for the most part!
I never realized ppl in American movies are always "rolled out" of hospitals lol. Why is that?
you make a good point. I guess i am just shocked that 40 yo man who is healthy and all dies stupidly. while this teenager gets beaten the shit out and still manages to survive and you are right everyone is different but i guess i would have preferred a less stupid way of killing that just pushing a man from some stairs and he fell a little
No. Henderson had got up to make a run for the door and Joe pulled him back, making him fall and hit his head.
Oh my sincere apologies, leaving 5 remarks like this in one day on a sub is way different and better than being all over the sub

/s
i also thought joe’s storyline was immensely repetitive & my s/o even got bored & stopped watching. it was just like replaying a song over and over again.
I wanted the first thing you said to happen so badly! I was so disappointed.
I mean yeah, they’re both psychos, both explain away their actions as “willing to do what it takes to protect their family”. but whereas love recognizes that she and joe are the same and perfect for each other joe is disgusted by love but doesn’t self reflect enough to realize he is the EXACT same. even their childhoods had many similarities. joe always says he wants someone to accept him for who he is but when he actually got that from love he didn’t want it. At least when love was alive there was more for the writers to work with plot-wise. if next season is just joe doing his same old shit in paris i’m not even watching.
It's because most of the population is white so the news cycle covers that in order to pull the highest demographic. In other countries they do the same. If a white tourist goes missing in Mexico they don't really care. It's us doing the investigating.
Lot of Europe, Australia/NZ as well. Wherever white people run the media and comprise a significant majority of the country

Wouldn’t make much sense for “white women syndrome” specifically to happen in Asian countries. In India (where my origins are), there is a different kind of colorism and castism that Im sure has a similar media phenomenon
There doesn’t *have* to be, in this case the subtext was a little more apparent than in previous seasons.

I think I gave a myriad of examples that suggest that is the case. This Season obviously tried to cover some of the pressing issues of 2020, so it’s not a far cry to suggest systemic inequality is one of them. 

So for example, in season 1 Joe dated Karen Minty (a person of color portrayed in a *very* positive light). And he took care of Paco. Peach brought in an Indian molly plug (portrayed as a sexy guy Peach hooked up with). Peach herself was a rich descendent of JD Salinger and portrayed by Shay Michell, who is half Filipina.

In no part of the show were there not people of a multitude of races portrayed in a variety of roles in mostly positive lights. And none of it was “an agenda”. But Season 3 was clearly more pointed

I am colored myself — granted I’m not black — but I don’t feel I hold much of a skin-color bias here. Just notice how much more prominent racial themes were this season
Um....PPE...separate rooms, maybe on video... the stuff all of us have been doing besides not being near anyone or talking to anyone

ETA that if no one was sick or experiencing symptoms then this should have worked for them
Hard agree 😭
oh i did forget about the flowers. however i was totally on theo's side so I guess I thought it was weird that love defended sherry
I thought she was doing that to get Sherry on side who could then promote her business.
I thought Theo sent the flowers to Love and used Sherry’s name in the card as a joke.
💯😂
Good writing and acting? Lol
He needed the cage to become fully optimized, at which point it became impossible to dislike him
I felt like that’s who helped Joe become Nick
Yeah that’s definitely a flaw in the show. She definitely needed employees. No single person could run a bakery on their own, especially with a baby.
I mean, I agree with you. These women can't hear the funny monologue in his head and they'd be more horrified by it than amused if they could. 

He must just project an "I've got my shit together" vibe and he's able to talk his way out of all kinds of situations, so I get why they fall for him.
I noticed it immediately.  Some writer is quite proud of that, I reckon.
It's implied he's not sleeping eating or doing anything but staring at video. When you do that kinda stuff you start missing all the details. You're too focused on "the big picture"
The majority of the world would call the cops after being threatened or physically attacked? How would you know that? Do you know how many attacks go unreported for a plethora of reasons—a few being fear of victim blaming, fear of being attacked again or killed, or not trusting the cops (POC, for instance)?
Eh you can ask your circle and I ask mine. We’ll get conflicting reports. And if you’re asking men/women you’ll get more different results. Idk what else to tell you
Half of all violent crimes go unreported according to a bureau of justice report that tracked violent crimes for 6 years.

I see you so passionately arguing this on the thread. What makes you so confident when being so wrong? 

https://wp.nyu.edu/dispatch/2018/08/31/why-do-so-many-crimes-go-by-unreported-in-the-states/

https://thecrimereport.org/2017/03/02/many-u-s-crimes-go-unreported-unprosecuted/
I wish the show ended with S3 that Joe and Love killed each other or Love killed Joe and the show is over. It’s honestly being dragged out for longer than it should run for.
Joe literally saved Paco. Joe sends Ellie money to make up for something his wife did. Joe literally lost a finger because of the real Will and killed the guy who was after him. They were cool last time we seen him. Beck was a cheating whore. Peach was a bitch who tried to shoot Joe. Benji was an asshole to the woman Joe loved. Candace and Joe had a complicated relationship but in the end he avenged her death by killing the woman who murdered her. He gave Henry away to protect him. Do you really want Joe raising a child? He's not bad, he just loves too hard. Idk. I see alot of myself in Joe.
What I’ve learned during COVID is people will put people at risk as well as themselves, then get excellent free healthcare from the same physicians and nurses who begged them to wear a mask, get the vaccine etc. They don’t have any real repercussions and some of them have probably infected hospital staff and some staff died unnecessarily. If someone flipped out on one of these self righteous, self centered a holes and I was on the jury? Well the defense attorney would love me.
Yeah I totally knew Love was gonna do something to that dude after he said it. Like what a prick. It's one thing if he came in all apologetic and actually meaning it but that fucker came in and almost laughed it off like it was a joke. I'd have probably hit him with a rolling pin too. Fucking moron. Not only did he not vaccinate his kid, he put them in direct contact with other children. I'd have sued the ever loving shit out of them for that. That's straight up endangering other people's lives. Fucking clowns.
[deleted]
I got heavy Walnut Creek/Moraga/Piedmont vibes from it
I thought the same thing. Yet somehow I expected them to find Joe's key first.
It fit with the rest of the show though. Love is a lot more sloppy at planning/executing than Joe is so of course her key would be the one that let them out.
Because you \*never know\* if the blind guy is really just playing a long con.
It’s definitely worth it, especially the 3rd book bc it’s a completely different story whereas 1 and 2 were more of a straight adaptation, although they did change some really important things in season 2
Maybe he's thinking of Ashtray and his underage dad in Don't Be A Menace.
Exactly! Cozy is my jam.
Yeah that’s not true in the slightest. Almost no one looks the same at 18 and 26. Your face is still changing at 18, I’d know.
> fully developed adults 


lol I stopped at this. no they aren’t. that’s their FIRST YEAR of adulthood. “Fully developed”? did you know you’re 25 is when you’re brain is “fully developed”? where the fuck did you learn this nonsense
Thank you and Joe “sacrificing ” himself for someone he loves just plays into his “true romantic” shtick. Real character development for Joe would be admitting he’s a horrible person and turning himself in. One “selfless” act doesn’t erase all the murders he committed and let’s face it for Joe it wouldn’t be selfless because he’d being doing it to feel better about himself. He needs real accountability.
I got major addiction vibes from him. He knows he is an addict, and thinks he can control it by just doing a little stalking. Being an addict though, obviously a little turns into a full-blown relapse.
I think our disagreement is over whether Joe made an active choice to reject that development. I don’t think he did, I think he was pushed into that old pattern due to his perception of betrayal from Love. He ends up rejecting the growth due to rejecting Love. I think you take him as making an active choice to reject the growth, and doing so consciously.
Yeah, that is true, he did keep…. A really macabre set of trophies.
Not at first. He started doing the stalking thing after the hunting trip to "take the beast for a walk." He thought that he needed to nurse his habit to keep it under control and keep himself interested in his marriage. He alluded to it a few times, like the line about quitting cold turkey always ending in a worse downward spiral.

Do I buy it? Not for a second. Joe is a notoriously unreliable narrator, and addicts tell themselves all sorts of lies to engage in their addictions. But I do think he's great at self-deception and genuinely convinced himself that he was only doing it to save his marriage and, more importantly, Henry. It wasn't until later that he stopped lying to himself and dropped the noble pretenses of why he wasn't taking any... souvenirs.
I would love to dig into this further. What would be weird about it? Its literally your SIBLING?
[deleted]
I’m crying at everyone downvoting ur first message then grudgingly agreeing that he looks like a pickle lmaooo
The crossover we all need
Yeah he seemed pretty gross and wayyy too assertive considering how much he was told no and kept pushing. In any other situation people would be talking about the rapey vibes he had but in parallel with the murders it made it seem not so bad
And then continued to flirt with him,contact him, strip at her window for him… Yeah it was totally one sided 🙄
Just finished S3 so I'm late to the party, but I swear it looked like he was always trying to hide a smile to me. Whether he was upset or trying to be romantic or concerned, he just had a face that looked like it was trying not to break out laughing.
Which is funny cause him and Love are dating IRL.
Okay but how many times have we seen the “they died in an explosion…..but did they really? 👀”
There is no plausible way she could've survived being paralyzed in a house fire
Everyone said the same thing about Beck..
She was the biggest liability
[deleted]
How is he toxic?
I think people like you see any group of men enjoying each other’s company and immediately call it toxic masculinity.
Babies are mostly CGI or dolls these days anyway
I think part of the point is that it's completely illogical and doesn't matter whether the child is a boy or girl, Joe is just a mysogynist and you see his way of thinking affect everything, even his relationship with his newborn child.
I do think that, I think women who aren't attractive don't really matter/exist to Joe
Preeetty sure preying on, stalking, objectifying, and murdering women qualifies as misogyny. Despite how much he tries to convince himself he actually cares about them & is a feminist lol. Women are disposable objects to him, all he truly cares about is the thrill of the chase.
I've STILL never been able to watch the finale anywhere!  :(
No she's evil
Again I didn’t like Beck’s character at all and was glad to see her gone, just didn’t feel any chemistry between Joe and Marianne. I think I’m honestly just missing Love
Hmm. Hopefully this works. Try adding > ! to the beginning and ! < to the end, but without the space between the two characters.
Agree with you. It didn't pick up my interest was so cartoonish and directionless. How could they mess it up so badly.
Sure, “psychology major” where is your proof cause all i see is someone pretending to be one in Internet. I don’t go announcing my credentials without any proof.

Go back where you come, you pretentious keyboard warrior.
so everybody saying Love was written sloppily is wrong? i never believed she killed to “protect” she always wanted control\jealousy, killed her first husband because of control.
Umm no she killed Delilah because she slept with joe.🙄
Right, Natalie was her thinking irrationally as well...but with Natalie, I'm pretty sure Love knew going into the future bakery location that she was going to do something to Natalie. With Gil, it was certainly more of an immediate impulse thing. Watching that scene again, she kind of took what he was saying in stride...then changed her attitude as he kept rambling on.  


With Theo, she definitely expected Joe to take care of it, but I think she knew Joe would take care of it better than she would.

As for Sherry + Cary, I'm thinking she initially was 'open to the idea' (remember, she was feeling it out with Joe at first), because it was some way of attempting to save the marriage - as Sherry's words in some sense inspired her. However, the bonding part afterwards clearly speaks for itself. Haha  


She definitely felt more open to killing, but the only time it really felt intentional was with Natalie...her only victim, actually. Just as Joe's was with Ryan. However, I think it stems down to the characters' motives though - as ultimately Love wants to protect her family, and Joe wants to protect...whoever he feels like protecting at the time. Both of those are the root of their insanities.
Joe does state to Will, "I wasn't thinking" when Will asks about the cage situation. I believe a similar thing can be used when Love did so. I think Love suggested getting rid of Gil, but Joe indeed tried to find an alternative. It's more of a 'motive' kind of thing. Joe impulsively knocked out Will (even though he did need his identity/etc) and wasn't thinking of long-term consequences. Love impulsively knocked out Gil (because of what he told her), and wasn't thinking of long-term consequences.
you can absolutely call out that phenomenon and educate someone without idk, making them feel like you're judging them for not knowing about it(or what its called). 

she definitely was giving him a hard time.
Yes I would’ve accepted Love killing Joe, cleaning it up sloppily as usual, getting caught by Theo, and going to Jail. Would’ve wrapped the show up nicely.
I mean she was doing the same thing though. She cheated on Joe with Theo and then made it seem like he was acting out and in the wrong. She constantly pretended like she genuinely cared for him and was trying her best, but when she was hallucinating her brother she admitted to herself that she didn’t really love him anymore. 

Also let’s not forget that at some point Joe was genuinely trying to make it work between them (in his own twisted way), but it was ultimately Love’s murderous tendencies that drove him away.
[deleted]
Love is like psycho deluxe. Bashed Theo and next minute literally planning a new baby. Like bitch, you're delusional and legit crazy.

 It made me think about how crazy are other people in their lives minus killings. :D
It wouldnt have been as interesting 100% I'm still glad she died. I think it ended off the season well honestly. I think they intentionally made her unbearable this season for that very reason. However, if anyone believed that she was the one in the right throughout this season than I think they may have some issues themselves haha.
True haha I love those songs as well
I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
Just saying women and men have as much potential. Unless one believes one gender triumph over the other.
I only cared about Cary and Sherry surviving. Theo was aggravating and stupid while Mike barely had anything to do, despite how central he felt to the story.
The point here is that representation matters, and she would be harmful representation and I would rather that not be added to the pile of harmful stereotypes surrounding BPD. I never once implied I'm the only one with issues. I'm well aware other people have issues which is why I attempt to be empathetic and not try to insult people when I disagree with them. People can perceive me however they want based on my ACTIONS, not based on my mental illness, which is why stigmas are harmful and I would rather not encourage them further. Either way, respond if you'd like, but I don't think we need to continue this conversation.
>Wooo, someone’s mad. Alright. I didn’t read the entire paragraph.


Funny, since I stopped reading right here. Enjoy the block lol
totally agree, love was my favorite character! her actress is too pretty!
The difference between me and you is that I don't want/care if Joe lives or dies and neither I'm trying to justify his actions like you do with Love. The thing is that your argument comes as double standard. Because if it was Joe who paralyzed a woman you wouldn't say he just wanted her to be loyal and stay with him forever lol. 

Let me rephrase your argument: Love wanted to take care of a PARALYZED James for the rest of his life. Can't you still realize how messed up is this? It doesn't matter at all what James was or wasn't prior to cancer because you simply don't paralyze every man who doesn't want to be with you? 

Theo made Love feel good but she still tried to kill him. You can not tell me one was justified for killing but not the other. You can't tell me Love was faithful and pretend to erase all she did with that word. Or can you justify all what Joe did in S1 only because he was faithful to Candace and Beck? I bet you can't. 

I think you're really biased here because there is no way someone could think Love, with all she did, was better than Joe. She killed her nanny? "Accidentally" killed her ex husband, Delilah, Nathalie... Joe also killed people from Beck's life and even the guy that Candace was cheating on him with. But I don't see you saying "he wouldn't have killed them if the girls were faithful to Joe to begin with". 

Both were psychos and both did wrong. There's nothing that could justify their actions.
*matthew engler has entered the chat*
Anti-vaxx bashing, all bad guys being white and male? Yeah, very made fun of
But the problem I have with that is that would mean she cared more about killing herself and Joe, confessing, and outing the town than actually getting her baby back, which she could have easily done instead of taking the time to make a letter and cooking Joe. She could have just killed Joe then went and got her baby back from Dante.

Anyways, that's my one plot hole, and Joe still got away with it.
Me 2 🙏🏻
I also found the Netflix movie *In the Shadow of the Moon* also with Michael C. Hall it’s a really good movie. 

And a TV series *The Following* starring Kevin Bacon.
Yes, I love those type of shows! Thanks for the recommendation! Something to distract me while waiting for the new season
really? what sense does it make that only Hispanic and white women can die for his obsession. Its not like were meant to root for joe
that's really interesting. kind of shocked that the showrunners made such radical changes to the storyline due to actress feedback.

Great though
ew really? thats stupid
i feel like that's a line your character can't really cross while becoming palatable to a general audience
Haha 😂 I recently started taking it and burst out laughing during that scene! No idea the added perks I'd be getting!
What is an iv bar?
Damn yeah nice catch! Poor Theo :(
Could be he had a neurological injury that affected his motor abilities.
Did we all just finish watching at the same time that's crazyyy
It’s hospital policy.
True, they could easily have had something protruding from the wall where he hit his head.
My first week in college this kid fell down like five stairs and died. Just happened to hit his head in the exact wrong place.
Yes, literally the dumbest death
I'll watch but I'm truly disappointed that he killed her :/

You nailed it with their dynamic and that's what I was most frustrated about as well. I feel for Love because I really do think she was trying her best and Joe literally could not see that she knew about and loved every single part of him. Think Mari is gonna love his murderous side when it inevitably comes out? She already called him toxic. With Love dead it would just become infinite seasons of him doing the same shit. They really could have milked Joe and Love's dynamic. There were so may directions they could have gone with it and I'm so bummed she was killed off. I thought Joe was going to become obsessed with their therapist, that could have been a cool reverse on the Dr. Nicky situation. I thought maybe they were going to open uo their marriage to flings or one night stands but no obsessions allowed and I wanted to see them navigate that. Like I am so so disappointed that this was the ending. Every time he walked over her lifeless body I was hoping she was going to pop up and do something. Seems unlikely that it could be a plot twist either based on Joe's narration at the end concerning the case.
This is what annoyed me the most. Everyone started hating on Love and it was exactly what was supposed to happen because Joe started hating the real version of her despite her being logically 'perfect for him'. Problem with that was that people rarely want to be with people so similar to themselves because they don't want to reflect. That's why the ending was so backwards in logical life terms. Love was willing to self-reflect and recognise the good and the bad in him but Joe only claimed to want to change and then didn't. She couldn't deal with him straying all the time and it brought out the worst in her, while he couldn't deal with her acceptance of every part of herself which made him keep needing to stray to a new obsession.
Yeah, it’s just the same ol at this point and no one wants to watch him with a new girl every season, ignoring their flaws, and then turning on them the moment he sees their imperfections. Too predictable.
Yea but America has more people than all those countries combined so obviously they will have more.

I'm Indian too, and I honestly cannot remember the last murder case that gripped the nation in the past few years. The most recent ones I can remember are Aarushi and Indrani and they were years ago. Both sorta boring upper middle class, nothing very striking about them. 

I think with the amount of random killing & lynching already happening here, no one really cares about murder. We move on to the next thing very quickly. Plus our police does nowhere near the amount of investigation these white guys do to drum up any sort of public interest.
I respect your intelligence and good eye for noticing subtext.
Love did it to fit into the community. If you’re good with Sherry, then you’re good with rich suburbia.
Same
That’s an interesting thought
My theory was sherry had delivered them to Theo and his dad for the lost of Natalie and Theo put them on loves door step to be like "do you really think I want this bitches sympathy"
Honestly, I was half expecting she was gonna hire the teen neighbor and that’s how the affair was gonna start, but then they went for an electric scooter joyride instead
That’s fine with me. Obviously they all died when they didn’t call the cops. You and “your circle” don’t like to involve law enforcement that’s totally fine. Doesn’t make the in-show characters any less stupid for not doing so. Worse case scenario they die. If they’re gonna die anyway they might as well call 911 to increase their chance of survival. As simple as that.
I’m a woman who has been the victim of violent crimes and you learn very quickly who the cops care about and who they don’t. Many people I know do not call the police either unless they absolutely have to. This is a big city I imagine people in the burbs have no idea what it’s really like if you’re low income living in a city and even worse if you’re a POC.
That's because your circle probably gets arrested more than mine :p
Because I was under the false impression that the rest of the world isn’t irredeemably stupid. Although I have to say quoting two US specific articles is hardly representative of the world. Maybe next time try these sources:

- http://www.unicri.eu/services/library_documentation/publications/icvs/statistics/17-icvs-app4.pdf
- https://www.adruk.org/our-mission/our-impact/measuring-the-dark-figure-of-crime-479/
- https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/61/2/364/5924614
- https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E7%8A%AF%E7%BD%AA%E9%BB%91%E6%95%B8/4385523

Though dated, at least the first survey (pg. 194, appendix 4 table 9) is a genuine attempt at comparing percentages of crimes reported across all industrialized countries, urban Europe and developing countries like Germany, France, Japan, Australia etc. Quoting sources that explore the dark figure of crime in one singular country is hardly substantial proof for what you are claiming.

Have a good day!
Then see a therapist.  Joe is a predator with a broken childhood that manipulates women until his projection falls apart and he kills them.
you see yourself in joe? get some help. and i see myself rooting for joe more often then not but joe is a bad guy. if this was real life 100% joe should be locked up but this is a tv show and i can hope he gets away with the shit he does lol. but bro if u see yourself in joe(the serial killer) plz get some help
He is definitely bad 😭 the show just does a good job at making u want to sympathize for him. Also yeah the only thing he did right was give Henry to someone who will love and protect him
joe literally showed himself to be a SERIAL KILLER to paco but you’re absolutely right that’s not traumatic or anything. joe stopped sending ellie money after marianne caught him taking a book and she was just never mentioned again. he sent a 15 year old girl off on her own with next to nothing and was like “start over! bye! is this parenting?” keeping people in cages and murdering them because you are trying to cut off the person you are stalking from everyone around them and projecting your weirdo stalker fantasies onto them without recognizing for a second they’re and actual person with an inner life that doesn’t exist to be your fantasy. that isn’t noble it’s psychotic. you have something seriously wrong with you and i’m really concerned for anyone who knows you in real life.
>He's not bad, he just loves too hard. Idk. I see alot of myself in Joe.

Then I agree with another comment and suggest you see a therapist. There is "no loving too hard" that should end with dead bodies. Maybe killing a pedophile or a murderer could be an acceptable exception to me, but how the hell could you justify killing people because they are inconvenient to the storyline in your mind or because they hurt your feelings? If you think like that you are going to kill a lot of people... Please, get some help to learn what love means. The only thing Joe did right here is giving up Henry to non serial killer parents.
I 💯 agree—I would have sued them, too. They at least need to pay for all the medical bills for my baby! 😤 I’m not sure what that would have done since they’re rich, but they need to face some sort of consequences for that baby almost dying. It’s ridiculous.
Oh. I used to live in San Mateo/Burlingame really. I didn’t get that vibe. I was thinking north and east like Sebastopol - which is where 13 reasons why showrunners said their fictional town was most like, but maybe for this show something closer, like Marin County. Who knows
I did too! When Cary was checking the walls and stuff for a weak spot I thought he was going to find Joe’s. I loved how they showed Sherry realizing there was a key in there somewhere.
Ash Tray!!! You BAMF, come give ya grandma a hug!
[deleted]
Yeah this exactly, not all protagonists have to be heros , and joe having a redemption arc would take away from the whole show like you said. I kinda like the idea that he might turn himself in though, it allows him to face accountability for sure. It’s kind like the way bojack horseman has to ultimately face accountability for his actions and come to terms with the fact that he is an asshole instead of just redeeming him. Idk if you’ve ever seen Bojack but I highly recommend it. Anyway it feels really satisfying to see a character willingly take accountability for their own awful actions so I wouldn’t mind that for Joe.
For me, being naked in a bathtub with another person is an intimate, inherently sexual situation. It's vanishingly rare that I'm naked around anyone who isn't a sexual partner, no less naked in the bathtub. It would be weird with anyone who isn't a sexual partner. The fact that it's my sibling just makes it even weirder. Under no circumstance do I want to see a family member's *sexual* organs.

Digging question in return: What about an adult father bathing with his 16 year old daughter?
This is also a big cultural thing. Adults being naked in a one on one situation is inherently sexual in the USA (I say this as an American), but when traveling abroad, being naked isn’t so odd, depending on the country and who is present. 

I remember only a few years ago, I went to the beach in Norway and nearly all the children 5 and under were naked. Men were not nervous about skinny dipping alone, or women too; although this level of comfort or “not that big a deal attitude” is changing. 

The USA has such a “nakedness is so sexual,” attitude in my experience, but we also push the most sexual content in a non sexual setting. Fashion, geez, even breast feeding is sexualized here.
It def wasn't a coincidence that he strolled into her bakery as often as he could
Your whole argument neglects the events before their first sexual encounter. It's illogical to justify your point based on cherry picking the events following her shutting him down repeatedly.
outer banks is shaking
She also took some crazy out of no where antidote
I guess it's possible she escaped before the fire got to her if he got the dosage wrong or something, once Joe was no longer in view? I mean, I think she's dead, but I would love it if she weren't and if she showed up in S4E10 to get some kind of revenge. It just seems impossible considering that Henry is still with his new family after the time jump in S3E10.
Oh I'd definatley agree. There just is a stereotype of the jock/dudebro being aggressive and domineering at least in entertainment.
Dude, I’d be down for a weekend of camping with my male friends and enjoying their company. Sounds like a great time! I’d even keep my shirt off the whole time if that’s how they wanted to do it. But if they tried to tell me we have to kill all our own food or we’re not connecting to our masculinity, I’d say “Fuck that. You do that if you want to, but I don’t want to, and don’t try to tell me I’m less of a man for it.”
Also for very young children like that you would have multiple actors taking turns
[deleted]
Wasn’t he mortified by the concept of Ellie saying he was fucking her?
Yh but no. He doesn’t kill them because they’re women. And he also kills men, so Is he a misandrist? Misogyny is defined as a hatred or prejudice for women. And despite being a lunatic, joe doesn’t seem to think women are inferior to men or anything like that.
🙄
Did it work? I could see after the spaces, thank you so much! And hope I didn’t spoil for anyone
Agreed, and people are not taking into account that obviously she's going to be a lot more jealous and compulsive when the father of her child is about to leave her
All of her murders were intentional. If you get emotional and decide to kill someone in the heat of the moment that's still intentional murder. If she dropped a brick off a building and it accidentally landed on Natalie's head then it wouldn't be intentional murder. Her murders weren't premeditated like some of Joe's were. Premeditated murder is generally conceived as worse than emotional murders (first degree vs second degree). However, Joe did one premed murder in s3 and Love did like 2. Joe also did a premed murder in s1 on Benji and attempted one on Peach but failed. The contrast with the characters is that Joe murders people out of a misplaced sense of protecting the people he loves. Love murders people who hurt her feelings and feels no shame/regret in her actions. Love was going to premeditatedly slit Marianne's throat (a fellow mom) and make Joe watch by paralyzing him with wolfs bane to punish Joe for wanting a divorce from her crazy ass. Did Joe ever do anything so cruel and vindictive to any of the women in his relationships?
She made the very salient point though that she felt the need to keep his interest because otherwise he would kill her & guess what? HE DID. Literally fearing for your life every step you take in your relationship has got to be pretty fucking tough.
But she wasn’t? She literally made the decision to kill him after her conversation with Marianne. She said she paralyzed him so they could talk about their marriage.
there’s always an illusion somewhere that babies will make us all feel better about ourselves only to find out in the end that they will just unleash our worst versions
If they have as much potential, then why does one gender commit something like 75% of all violence? I’m just saying, that across all cultures for basically all of recorded history, men have been more violent than women. There’s either some biological component there or one hell of a coincidence.
We are all in this subreddit because we're fans of a show centered around a serial killer. Let's be honest, if Joe dies or gets arrested for his actions, the show most likely ends. And as far as my argument being a double standard, it doesn't make sense because so far nothing has indicated that Joe would do something like that. If a girl he's pursuing doesn't want to be with him, he will most likely kill her so that nobody else can have her.

"Cant you still realize how messed up is this?". Do you realize how messed up this show is lmao? Like you could point at everything Joe and Love does and you could say "I can't believe they did that". But that is basically a ongoing theme of the show. That's why I say put yourself in the context of the series.

Love tried to kill Theo because at that point he's seen the basement and  his trust was compromised. Nothing more, nothing less. And you say that both of these people are equally bad, yet you seem defensive of Joe when I bring up points about Loves actions.

She killed her nanny because she raped Forty and gave him drugs lmao. IMO if any killing was justifiable, this would be at the top of the list. She wanted to take care of James. She killed Delilah because like Theo the trust was compromised. She killed Natalie because that was the first girl Joe was fixated on. In the last episode with Love/Joe/Marianne, if Joe played the role of Love and Marianne was a guy/girl in the way of a girl Joe was fixated on, I can't guarantee that she would've made it out alive.
>Anti-vaxx bashing

how the actual fuck is that woke? not vaxxing your kids puts other kids at harm , that's a fact , I'm sorry it hurts your feelings based on Facebook knowledge .

>all bad guys being white and male?

Ah yes ,Peach Sallinger, Sherry and all those bitchy women at Madre Linda were  white males. Annoying teen *girl* Ellie was also a white male acc to you ?
“If I as a Black woman was to take part in this, and being the place that we’re at in our world right now, I would feel uncomfortable letting Marienne be so oblivious to Joe’s antics. And I would be very averse to having him kill her,” Gabrielle said. “I asked them upfront: ‘Are you going to honor and respect what’s happening right now in the world and acknowledge my race and make sure there’s truth in that?’ And they were like, ‘Absolutely.’ ”

thats, a really dumb reason for the character to survive
[removed]
A scam lol

But srs, they're like medical spa type places, sometimes they have additional services like cryotherapy etc but basically the shtick is that a medical professional of some kind administers an IV full of vitamins and minerals and extra goodies and you come out feeling brand new and like Tom Brady I guess. 

Glutathione is something I've seen offered a lot at these types of places for "rejuvenating" purposes. I've seen some beautubers talking about getting glutathione IVs for skin brightening purposes. I'm sure getting an IV will like rehydrate you but idk that they do much else and they're pretty pricey for something that may have zero benefit 

I have heard of people getting them for the morning after wild parties though and that actually kinda makes sense if you're THAT hung over since i would think they would replenish any hydration loss
Hey, at least he’ll eventually be able to walk again, even if it’s not completely like it used to be! And he got to nail the hot neighbor lady! What horny teenager with a hot neighbor doesn’t dream of that? Lol!  Plus those are some mighty fine bragging rights right there! Lol!
I wish she had gotten away too. It would've left us wondering.
The US is big, but it does not have more people than Europe and Oceania combined lol. 

Our population is equivalent to that of Germany, France, UK, Italy, and Spain combined. That doesn’t touch half of Europe let alone Aus/NZ. 

And there are several instances of MWWS outside the US. The UK, with its vestiges of global media influence, also famously experiences the phenomenon quite regularly

About India:

Whenever I see the news, it’s about politics or *band*’s. I’ll be honest, I don’t know much though. I don’t speak Hindi, so my news knowledge is all English-based media. 

What I do know is missing persons incidents happen in droves and the police are too weak & corrupt to deal with them. Like most people, especially the poor ones, stay missing forever. 

And yeah, you’re right. Crime generally just happens. India’s social (and physical) infrastructure is developing really fast though, I’m sure things will get better
American doesn’t have more people than Europe  
Lol 😂 😂
Well cheers! I appreciate your push-back as well
I also believe Love didn't want the search to be disrupted, They NEEDED someone to find the axe and if Theo and sherry had too much of a fight it takes away from them searching for the axe they planted for their plan.
Did we watch the same show?

Ryan was a stimulant junkie and incredibly narcissistic. 

His character would have enjoyed catching Joe out like that and proceeding to kick him and beat him up. 

Why call the cops? What are you going to tell them? You beat the shit out of some guy you have no proof of following you? 

He bested Joe and got off on laughing at how pathetic he felt Joe was.
When you said "the world" I thought were using it the same way one would say "everybody".

Why would we look at the attitudes of non US countries when discussing the likelihood of someone calling the cops in the US? 

Doesn't matter. I hope you do as well.
Joe has literally killed both pedophiles and murderers. Has he been redeemed yet?😂
Yo, your age is showing.
even then...they’re not “fully developed” adults physically either???
But wouldn’t he turning himself in be a sort of redemption?
So when you mom bathed you as a kid thats sexual? When you bathed with cousins or siblings that was sexual? Come on. Nakedness is not inherently sexual our culture made it that way. If the 16 year old for what ever reason cannot bath herself it would fall on her care takers. You are making it weird. Sexual organs are not just for sex and there are a plethora of situations where being naked isnt sexual
Like what? Can you be specifically? I binged the show so I could be missing something
you're kinda answering your own question lol. the whole 'chivalrous' thing is inherently misogynistic.
Misogyny isn’t necessarily that simple or obvious.  Just like how there’s covert racism, misogyny can be covert as well. You don’t have to openly or even consciously hold prejudice against women or poc to be considered misogynistic or racist. A lot of that shit is subconscious and subtle. 

Joe is pretty overtly misogynistic though, at least on the outside;  Within his own mind he is more covertly (subconsciously) misogynistic. But he literally sees women as possessions and feels entitled to have them, that 100% makes him misogynistic.

The creator of the show Sera Gamble, even described Joe as “intensely misogynistic”. Penn Badgley has also referred to his character in that way. Even the author of the original book series has called Joe a misogynist. It’s literally a key trait of how the character was created.
Point made
🥺
I think you have to add it to each paragraph individually; so, before "Love" and after "Marianne.", before "Love" and after "now!", and before "Then" and after "much!". I also believe you need to remove the space between the ! and the word for it to work on desktop (though it works on mobile for some reason).

It's still far too complicated, so I don't blame you for not knowing! And don't stress about spoiling it for anyone; this is meant to be a free-for-all, so it's their own fault for being in this thread in the first place!
Love's motives come from wanting to protect her family at all times, and Joe's come from wanting to protect either ones he loves/ones he deems need protection. Regarding Marienne, Love was clearly going to premeditatedly kill her - yet she also didn't know Marienne was a mom. She met her during the library party, and didn't have enough information on her. I also think her chatting with Sherry \[while she was\] in the cage also probably put some bad ideas in her head as well. Towards the end, Love's actions while of course crazy, also came across as desperation to want to save her family. Abstract thinking though.
…..after she tried to murder him.  He offered divorce, she’s the one that made the situation “love me or die”
So she wanted to talk to him and kill him for sure?
Gender superiority is a social construct.

Most of the people working in the legal system are men. While the statistics showed majority of the solved homicides are committed by men, there are more than 200,000 unsolved murders in the states since 1990-2019 (https://projectcoldcase.org/cold-case-homicide-stats/).   With how the society emphasising on the superiority of the male intellect and physical strength, crime investigations focused more on crimes committed by male because most men commit crimes against other men due to love, loathing, robberies based on solved homicidal statistics. 

Additionally, if someone who appear weak incite or encourage a crime, without either parties(killer and victim) being aware of it, the manipulators could literally get away with murder although they did not use any physical force. Because there were no evidence of agreement nor intent.

Given how little details (conspiring, incitement, unsolved murders data) we have based on the statistics on homicides, it is a bit presumptious to assume one gender is less superior than the other and thus less likely to commit homicide.
I won't read everything I'll just stop at "how messed up this show is". Yes. It is messed up. That's why you can't just justify one character's actions and blame the other when both are the same lmao. Have a good day.
The guy who harrassed Paco, Forty, the main guy himself, the rapist, etc. etc. 

But yeah, keep believing its only making fun of wokes. smartass
What the fuck does any of that have to do with the story and characters?
technically that wouldn't have stopped love killing her.
🤨🤨 that sounds so ignorant. She’s victimizing herself apropos of nothing.
QQ
This is all quite true, however, i think the genre is being wildly understated. GoT can pull of killing kids, since all characters engage in questionable behaviour, but You very clearly has two protagonists that one is supposed to understand in the context of a 2021 western society.

Thankfully, while the jury is still out on murder as a whole (sometimes justified sometimes not), we've all agreed that child murder is not it.
Ahhh tyy
He nailed a SERIAL KILLER lady and survived he gets so many bragging rights and probably a sick cult following
Yeah some serial killer ass might be worth it
Yes! like at the VERY LEAST let her get away and be popping up to screw with him later. I feel like I can’t totally rule that out? I would have more respect if that happened but like I said his narration recap at the end seemed pretty final.
>India’s social (and physical) infrastructure is developing really fast though, I’m sure things will get better

This is soooooo not true, things are actually getting worse. 

It was hyperbole about the population thing, there are more people and more media in the U.S. so more MWWS was my point.
I never said Ryan isn’t narcissistic and I never said Ryan isn’t a drug addict. Actually I don’t understand how anything you said contrast with everything I said. He can be all that and still call 911. If he had hired a PI he would’ve had proof, genius.
Or you could just admit Clara was right, lol.
He also killed plenty of other people because they were inconvenient to him. You don't get redeemed, for whatever reason, after killing someone. What kind of backward logic is that? Are you a serial killer too?
Ok i know what they said is ridiculous, but people’s ages are always going to show regardless.
[deleted]
Sure, but I think it would be a \*just\* redemption. The right kind of redemption. This may be radically Christian of me (even though I'm not Christian), but I believe all humans are worthy of redemption if they truly atone for their sins, no matter how grave. If he accepts that he's a danger to everyone he meets and embraces his punishment - willingly faces what is just, accepting and even welcoming his punishment -  I believe that is true atonement and, in a weird way, a welcome message in a culture that is completely steeped in vengeance.

I agree that him "seeing the light", having a revelation, stopping his behavior, and getting to live out his perfect life with a happy family devoid of lasting consequences would be a disgusting ending to the series. He doesn't deserve that kind of happiness, and that would be the wrong kind of redemption. But... ever read Crime and Punishment, the book Joe uses to get his job in season 2? The happiness the protagonist feels when finally accepting his punishment? I can't imagine a better ending for the series than that.
When a person cannot bathe themselves either due to age or handicap, then yeah, another person bathing them makes sense, because it's necessity. That said, you're adding the "cannot bathe herself" to the father/daughter situation for a reason: you seem to recognize that a father bathing with his completely capable 16 year old daughter would be weird.
You are comparing childs to adults. They werent kids in the bathtub scene.
I don't understand the downvotes, your comment is spot-on. Joe worships women as long as he views them as those perfect creatures that need saving, as his soulmates, but then he quickly becomes disillusioned and sees them as disposable, as you said.
I tried again and deleted the space, v nice of you to take the time! Thanks again 👍🏼
Sure, Jan.

Edit: Lol you added all of this shit to your comment after I responded.
You say that none of these people are indefensible yet you clearly took the side of Joe the whole time. Sorry that I had a different take on Love. Peace.
Forty? yeah you prolly shouldn't be watching the show , not just this or any modern show, just no shows really, even non woke ones
