I’m a bit disappointed that the show turned Kate and Edwina into a triangle because it felt like a disservice to her as a sister to Kate. One of the things I really enjoyed about them in the book is her sort of noticing that Kate and Anthony have something between them. Instead, the show’s version seems perfectly content to focus on herself and her season than trying to ensure her sister finds love as well (despite Kate’s many protests).
Insane chemistry between Kate & Anthony. And yes, I finished the whole season in one sitting.
I wish they would've developed the library and Kate hiding under the desk scene as it was in the books. They were the best imo, it was crucial moments when they realize their physical attraction and later love. Also so little screentime of them together as a couple  , like literally the last 12 minutes , sigh ...
Not enough Anthony and Kate. Too many side plots. Still enjoyed the season though.
Anyone else lowkey mad at the lack of Anthony & Kate ‘fluff’? I really like how they brought in emotion from Anthony especially when he was upset on the couch but I felt the last few episodes lacked that bonding that those who haven’t read the books needed to be convinced it was true love and not just desire… ya know? Not to mention them making Edwina and Anthony very attached… made Edwina annoying in the last few episodes 🥲
People don't want to watch a guy try to marry his love interest's sister. There, I said it.

It works in the book because a) he gives up on making any real effort at courting Edwina pretty quickly and b) Edwina is never particularly into him.

They took it way too far in this adaptation. It's not cute or charming to watch - even if the actor and his performance is cute and charming.
The pacing was just not quite right. Everything went on one episode too long. It was one too many almost kiss. The relationship with Edwina went on one too many episodes. If we had walked it all back an episode, they could have been together for more than 10 minutes of the season. But overall, I still really enjoyed it.
Another disappointment for me is how Lady Danbury noticed Kate and Anthony’s connection and pushed them apart. Meanwhile book!Danbury is team “I like your wife, Bridgerton.”

Sigh.
Even as a rabid fan of the book, I loved the new season. The chemistry was off the charts, and the progression of their relationship felt very natural. 

Things I did not like/missed from the books:

\- The scene with the opera singer and Kate under the table

\- The scene with the storm, and the conversation Mary has with Kate about her being her daughter all the same. I know the conversation was there, but I don't think it was expressed the trauma Kate had about her own mother

\- The fear Anthony had of his own mortality- More Newton!

\- The wedding scene dragged for far too long

\- Where the hell is Francesca??

Things I loved:

\- I like they developed Edwina more as a character. On the books, she does little but do what her sister tells her. I would not have make her fall in love with Anthony, because that is too much betrayal from Kate, but I liked that it started as a meek person and developed to a woman not afraid to speak her mind

\- I loved momma Featherington defending her daughters.

\- I loved the introduction of Sir Phillip, I think it ties well with past storylines

All in all, I really loved this season even if it veered from the book. They took a general premise, certain scenes and they made a different story, one that I liked very much for different reasons than the ones I like the book for.
I felt like it dragged on in the second half and it got really annoying…
I really want Edwina and Prince Friedrich in S3! Giving me major Bingley and Jane vibes..
I am actually really bummed they didn't tease Benedict and Sophie at the end. The show did drag at points and the wedding dragged too long in my opinion. I wish they had reconfigured the plot a bit so we could get Lady Bridgerton's final ball at the end of the season so we can get Sophie and Benedict, as that would lead into the time skip more naturally with the wait for the new season as opposed to next season where we spend an episode setting everything up only to get a time skip in episode 2.
What the hell was that?!

I'm sorry, but that dragged. Oh, they're totally meant to be together, let's create way too many obstacles and cause a disaster of a wedding. Why?! This was super frustrating.
I loved the book more than this season. 

I'm a simple person, I will reread to cleanse my pallette and as I go along, purposefully skip parts that are problematic plus reimagine some scenes/lines that I liked from the series and incorporate them in my imagination.

Cheerios! 🤸‍♂️
Positives:

- Kate and Anthony everything. Simone and Johnny put their entire body in the bag. They were made to act with one another. And Show Kathony was better theb the book version, imo.

- Lady Danbury is such a bad bitch and I loved seeing more of the friendship between her and the Queen.

- Benedict, my sweet precious Benedict.

-  As a person who reslly was not a fan of Phillip and Eloise, I really thought Theo and Eloise were so cute.

- The acting from everyone was divine. Like they werr brilliant.

- Penelope and Colin- loved seeing the early progressions and that shift in Colin's face throughout the season. They both arent ready for their own season, since they are the true slow burn of the show. But man, the angst and that ending with the iconic quote really makes me want more. It makes me want to see Colin "Im a simp for Penelope" Bridgerton at thid moment.


The Not so good:

- Why pull that move with Penelope and Eloise? Like I hated that departure.

- Not enough Newton.

- While I did like Edwina, and happy they fleshed her out and made her more complexed and with layers, I can see why some could not like the show version at all.

- I wish we saw Kate and Anthony life after marriage.
God, ShowEdwina sucked. This proposal and wedding storyline shouldn’t have been drawn out so long for the pure sake of drama. Where were all the scenes of them falling in love! Book Edwina seemed infinitely more mature, independent speechifying regardless. Also didn’t like how much of Kate and Marys warm relationship they cut-it hardly seemed like they cared. 

Also didn’t like the way they cut the more explicit content about Anthony’s sense of his own mortality. I thought it really deepened their relationship.
I love Eloise, but Idk...she kind of annoyed me this season.  Her scenes with Benedict and fsmily were great. But I totally understood Penelope when she said Eloise always bitvhes about how awful her life is but she does nothing to change it.

I kind of hope they show Eloise struggling without having her best friend by her side next season. All the while, they continue showcasing Madame Delacroix/Penelope duo, and start introducing the bond between Lady Danbury and Pen, caused I loved those two together in the books.
I started watching the show 2 mins after it was released on Netflix. I was soooo looking forward to the Season 2 that I read the book a week before and hyped myself up so much more. But the show  was soooo off tangent from the book I was thoroughly disappointed. It almost seems like its not fair to compare the book and the show. The show just took the characters and added its own story to it. There were so many little details I wish the show had paid attention to. I am going to list them out because I need a space to just let it all out:  


1. First and foremost, when Anthony and Kate make love for the first time, its not in the porch at all. In the book, Anthony and Kate make out in the porch and Anthony wants to lose himself in her but he refrains from doing so because he didn't want their first time to be in his mother's porch and he had way more regard and respect for her than that. That was an absolutely important detail that the show overlooked.
2. Where is the entire story about how scared Kate gets when there's rain and thunderstorms? The small scene in the library made no justice whatsoever. It was steamy yes, but there was so much more to it in the book than in the show. Anthony loves the thunder whereas Kate hates them.
3. Newton deserved so much more screen time.
4. The drama between Kate and Edwina was completely unnecessary. All of their promotions talked about sisterhood but what I saw in the later episodes were far from that. Charithra captured Edwina in the looks but the writing lost Edwina's essence. Both Kate and Edwina are selfless in the book.

Some positives that I liked were:

1. The story of Edmund and Violet and the young Bridgerton family.
2. The story of Theo and Eloise.
3. The music and the chemistry, good lord.
4. Colin meeting with Marina and coming to realize he still hasn't come to terms with what happened, Marina pointing out how he is still a boy whereas she had to grow into the shoes of a wife and a mother.

The show honestly could have cut down the prolongment between Anthony and Edwina's engagement and used all that screen time to build the story of Anthony and Kate after they were married and also how Edwina finds a suitor for herself. The book was perfection and the show ruined it. The makers are not obligated to stick to the book entirely but shouldn't there be some justice to the original story?!
#This Author was disappointed that the show strayed away from the book. Apart from an encounter with the bee, a fun game of Pall Mall, and an unforeseen accident, this season was changed drastically to fit in more drama and tea. Furthermore, the invitation to The Viscount and The Viscountess' wedding must have gotten lost in the mail because This Author was certainly not invited.
I hope season 3 cuts down on the side plots, it was just too much and took away time that should have been spent on Kate and Anthony. I still enjoyed the season but I was left wanting more out of the season. I enjoyed the Featheringtons in season one but their scammer storyline this season should have been axed.
I feel as though the season had me sitting on the edge of my seat and truthfully questioning what ending we were going to have even half way through the final episode. I have to say I enjoyed it incredibly but I do feel as though it was dragged on a little too long. The wedding episode especially felt like it was just incredibly slow. The sexual tension and chemistry was absolutely outstanding and I feel as though, for me, it was an extremely good substitute for the MANY intimate scenes we saw from Daphne and Simon. If anything I preferred it this way. I do think that they tried to serve book and tv fans a lot but it ended up perhaps not fully pleasing one side or the other fully. I think that some of the plot could definitely be shortened and I was sad not to see much of Kathony actually together in the end. It also did not set up next season at all unlike season 1 so I can see why people have been questioning it they will be following the timeline of the books.

All in all I have to say I really enjoyed this season. Anthony became so vulnerable and open with his feelings which I feel is not often seen from men in television. I can see why some people would feel left quite sad at the state of affairs at the end of this season and I would have much preferred if there was even one more episode of Kathony actually together as next season will move swiftly on. To which couple remains to be seen.

&#x200B;

(Although I do believe it will be Benedict and Sophie)
Disappointed and it had nothing to with the acting. The acting was the best part. 

They took a beautiful love story and turned it into some awful love triangle between sisters. Also the scandal it would cause to break off an engagement and then marry the sister. 

The fact that we don’t get to see Kate and Anthony grow in marriage and had to watch this engagement was frustrating. 

Also not enough Newton.
One thing I found really annoying is the Edwina’s role in the Kanthony relationship. Why did they make them get engaged and create this complex thing? Anthony barely courted Edwina in the books and I loved that they didn’t make it a huge thing how Kate “betrayed» Edwina. They made it so cliche in the show and it ruined it for me. How everyone was disappointed with Anthony and Kate? Wtf? Can’t they be happy he found someone he loves instead of an obligation they always talk about. I felt so bad for Anthony and Kate how they were treated, as if they did something criminal. Also, Anthony being the villain in the eyes of his siblings when he suffered FOR them? Ugh
Of all the books this was the one I was looking forward for. 

The show did not feel like the viscount who loved me, it was more like a subplot. Felt like Kate and Antony got screen time similar to or even lesser than featheringtons.

Wish we could have seen more of how both of their love grew with words or situations , rather than just sexual tension. 

 they could have atleast included all the turning points of kantony from book. 

1. Newton was like an afterthought 
2. Kate and Mary’s dynamic was off
3. Book Edwina knew what she wanted, show Edwina was clueless , she did not spend any time with Antony and was already in love!!
4. wedding episode felt so unnecessary.
5. Anthony Edwina was dragged too long. 

After few episodes I skipped all the subplots coz I wanted to see Kate and Antony together.. I really did not care for other plots.

S1 was so much better.  Overall wasted talent. Actors had great chemistry.. pity we did not see more of it.
Please allow me to ramble and post-process my feelings after bingeing S2. 

Yes:

* The casting was divine. I wrote a pretty long, passionate comment on youtube when the first trailer dropped about how amazing the casting was for the sisters that it got ripped off and the copy got 1k+ likes hahaha I have very strong feelings of approval with this casting. Yes they ditched the blonde hair blue eyes sitch but I think both actresses really embodied the spirit of the girls
* Holy shit Jonathan Bailey?? I heard he slept/rested a lot during the filming of this season idk to look fresh anyway he should keep doing it because >!aesthetic!< reasons
* I loved the expansion on Penelope and Whistledown, especially the aspect of her conducting this business and what it said about women carving their own space in this age. I'm not sure I like to direction they headed to with regards to Whistledown, but I feel that it was important at least that it got dissected. [I discuss it a bit more elsewhere.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BridgertonNetflix/comments/taesii/yes_to_expanding_penelope_and_lady_whistledown/)
* I like that Benedict gets a bit fleshed out in the series vs the books. TBH I wasn't a huge fan of AOFAG because it gets a little weird with him and Sophie's power imbalance and the whole phantom girlfriend bit was also a kinda weird. I really really like SeriesBenedict, though. His personality was more how I envisioned BookColin to be like
* The Benedict and Eloise dynamic that has carried over from S1 is heartwarming and must be protected

Ehh..

* The De-aging was a bit unnerving, I'm not gonna lie
* I hope they find a way to make SeriesColin more affecting. I'm not sure if it's the writing or the acting or both. Like what even was the deal with him going to Sir Phillip and Marina's home? No offense to the actor, but Benedict is just stealing the show with the level of charm I more associate with Colin. Giving him the uncovering-the-Ponzi subplot was probably a good move though, gave him more stuff to do before we get to the Penelope yearning portion.
* Why did they feel the need to destroy the Eloise and Penelope dynamic? The whole Hunt for Lady Whistledown is honestly such an annoying subplot. Eloise+Pen is one of the anchors of the book series. It's a very secure, healthy female friendship that isn't centered around boys or whatever and they never had to tear each other down. Penelope having that secret in the books was justifiable because people can have private lives apart from their friends. But SeriesWhistledown had done a fair bit of damage to the Bridgertons and idk if Penelope can tell herself that they were purely selfless reasons. I like that they expanded Pen/Whisteldown, I don't like that they did it at the cost of what was supposed to be the centerpiece friendship between two women in the series. I was highly disappointed by the decision to effectively break them apart over boys and secrets.
* Also related, how tf are Colin and Penelope gonna make up after he (inevitably) finds out what she's done.
* I'm not sure what I feel about the whole Lord Featherington plot. Like?? Is this quite unnecessary? Kinda. Do I like seeing Moms Getting Stuff Done (even if it's a Ponzi scheme?) Kinda. 
* Theo. Hmm. From the replies to my other posts it seems like Sir Phillip is not particularly popular in this sub, so I get that Theo is probably an attractive alternative, but I'm meh about it. Eloise was insanely adorable in her interactions with him but I do feel that \*gestures vaguely\* the whole thing was very ill-advised.
While I love Charithra Chandran as an actor and will be watching for her other work, I'm not a fan of show-Edwina (halfway through episode 5). She seems slightly more self-centred? Oblivious? I feel like Kate and Anthony were obvious to everyone else but Edwina just... missed it?
Like many others, I wish they had dedicated more screen time to Anthony and Kate. Of course, I was convinced of their mutual sexual attraction—they did a great job with what few scenes they had—but I was hoping they would have … talked to each other some more? Flirted playfully? Joked around? Heated “frenemy” banter is good and all, but a few more lighthearted scenes (like the one where they fell in the mud) would have lifted the romance to a higher lever, in my opinion. 

On a related note, I was surprised they didn’t milk the stormy library scene for what it was worth. I remember it being a turning point in the book (which I’ve only read once, and many years ago to boot).

I don’t know. I had to go through some scenes at 1.5x speed, to be honest. The love triangle made me cringe—on that point I really wish they had stuck to how the book portrayed the sisters’ relationship. The Whistledown/Featherington plots got tiring too.

Benedict was an unexpected highlight for me. I’m really hoping they manage to do his story justice. He’s such a sweetie. 

On the whole, I ate this up with equal parts frustration and (mild) enjoyment. I don’t think I’ll watch it again. But I must say, I really did feel the attraction between Anthony and Kate!
I cant believe i was counting down the days and stayed up all night for this... They took away the trauma that kate and anthony dealt with in the books. They DRAGGED things for 8 episodes just to resolve it at the end in 10 minutes???? Kate and Anthony has equal or less screen time than the side plots (which I found myself skipping through) when this is suppose to be their season... Idk I literally feel heartbroken, this is my favourite book, my favourite couple and I feel like the show was something entirely else.
I loved Anthony and Kate’s chemistry but the entire season wasn’t well-written. We barely even know about the couple and I didn’t find myself rooting for them. I was bored for a lot of binge-watching it, especially because there were too many plots to follow that weren’t necessarily adding to the main story (the dramatic hunt for Lady WD, the Featherington’s plot, THE WEDDING???, the way they changed the narrative to suddenly be about sister conflict when it was inner turmoil and responsibility in the book). 

The match is compelling, and there were parts where I was pleased with the story. But much of what made Kate and Anthony appealing in the book, their insecurities and fears, were lost in the series. A lot of the book explored their relationship, and this season did not do them justice at all, with most of the portrayals shallow and the conflicts too dramatic. Even their meetings/interactions aren’t compelling. 

The first season was nice because although we got to know the characters, the main focus was the relationship of Daphne and Simon. Here, there seems to be more screen-time with them interacting with others than with one another. Not to mention, the first season stayed somewhat faithful to the book, with tweaks that made sense, but here, they removed the characters of their depth.

And it’s not like the books are the finest pieces of literature either (I read the first three only in 2020, and again after watching season 2). In fact, I have a lot of qualms. But at least the narrative was clear, and the main couple was endearing to watch. They just drenched 8 episodes with unnecessary drama that I found myself using the show as background noise while I did more interesting things.

Also disappointing because I loved the casting.
Im not a fan of the books, so Im not comparing. But I have to say, after my first watch Im a bit disappointed. I missed the lightheartedness in especially the second half. There was so much drama in every plot. And the wedding and the fall out from the wedding dragged on for soooo long. I also feel Kate and Anthony had so many almost kisses, and a lot of characters had monologues to other characters how to life their life. Even multiple monologues about the same thing. How many times does someone need to be warned? It felt like I watched the same scenes over and over again. I hope that my second watch will make me feel different.
How did they manage to fuck up such a great source material
Just finished the season and wow do I have thoughts. The ending scene was super cute but I had major issues with this season.

I didn't mind Anthony and Edwina getting engaged, but I hate that it went to the wedding day. 

I love Penelope but there was to much focus on her being LW and also her family.

Absolutely hated the Bridgerton's being embroiled in scandal not once but twice this season.

Anthony & Kate getting together took way to long. I wanted to see them married for more than 5 minutes.

The second half dragged on and was pretty boring at times. I had to watch it at 1.5x speed just to get through most of it.

There were way to many side plots this season. They have saved it for next season when half of it takes place in the country.

I actually wanted to see Anthony repair his relationships with his mother and siblings. He says multiple times how he thinks his entire family hates him and I wanted to see that resolved.

I am super disappointed that Penelope did not say anything when Colin made that statement like in the books.
I didn't love how many different plotlines were going on in the episodes, they felt incredibly busy. Episode 3 and episode 8 are standouts for me along with episode 6 >!poor Edwina!<
Kate and Anthony were everything and I thought they had so much more chemistry than Simon/Daphne. However - I kept wishing for more/longer scenes with them. All the featherington scenes could have been cut in half and that time given to Bridgerton clan and their exploits etc.
I think I’m the only book reader who actually enjoyed it for what it was and not for a page by page copy of TVWLM (or the others, for that matter). The essence and heart of Kanthony was there intertwined into particular book scenes or improved on for TV - and now I have book hornies *and* TV hornies. Twice the fun! Plus the show added a lot more layer and depth to the characters that were pretty much props in the book. For me, utterly perfect, and I don’t feel left behind as an avid fan of the books at all.
The love triangle was messy af and honestly Anthony and Kate started getting on my nerves after a while. I much preferred the book version of how things went down. Idk if it’s just me but I feel like they didn’t do Kate justice. Loved Ashley Simone but maybe it was the writing?
I think this season tried too hard not to follow too many plot points from season 1 with Anthony compromising Kate and then agreeing to marry her. Because of that they had to make up a different plot and while I enjoyed the performances (especially of Anthony and Kate, and Mama Bridgerton knocked it out of the park) I just didn’t enjoy the plots all that much. The secondhand embarrassment I got at the wedding scene and aftermath was too much.

I’m not a book purist and I was happy to hear they were changing some things but ultimately I don’t think the changes they made were much better.
I think their biggest mistake was not allowing us to see Kate and Anthony's wedding and married life. It would have been great seeing Anthony go through what he put Daphne and Simon through last season. 

I also hate what they did with the Edwina/Kate relationship. It would have been more fun seeing Edwina trying to hook her sister up first. Instead of wasting an episode on a wedding that didn't happen.
Is it a little sad to think how I am losing sleep over how disappointing this season was. I had such high hopes. :/
Things I liked:
-Kathony, you win, I love you more than Polin. Just chef’s kiss. Hopefully we’ll get more fluff from them in later seasons to make up for the lack here-kinda sad there weren’t a lot of kathony sex scenes (does that make me a pervert? 😂)

-Portia and Varley own me now. I used to hate Portia but now she’s an icon. I kind of don’t see how they can go for the characterisation that she has in RMB because I do think there is a genuine love for her daughters there. You could actually really see how Penelope was her mother’s daughter in this season-both are intelligent, formidable women.

-Violet is my favourite Bridgerton now. Honestly, MVP of the season. I loved the family moments in this season too. Lady Danbury is also my icon and I loved the Queens tender moment with Edwina.

-Colin apparently got the family braincell for 5 mins this season. I saw glimpses of the strength he has in RMB when he took down Lord Featherington in 8! It’s strange because there were moments I did think he actually truly was starting to like Pen and I could see his brain working but then he went and ruined it in the final 10 mins of 8! His laddy behaviour was OOC and too cruel for him. The reason it worked in RMB was because it was earned-he snapped from the pressure of his Mother and his brothers. Being mean about Penelope to a bunch of lads was just cruel. 

-Benedict was cute this season but I always want more from him-at this point it would be a weird character change to make him more like the Benedict in AOFAG! I can’t imagine this sweet soft Benedict forcing a woman to be his mistress!

Dislikes:

-Eloise. I absolutely could not stand her this season. Or her weird hats. Or her immersion breaking modern haircut! They tried to hint with Theo that Eloise had class based privilege but not for a single second did it look like that sank in for her. I felt uncomfortable with her teasing Theo-she had money and an education, If that of a lady but still. She was punching down without even realising it and it made me lose respect for her because Eloise truly is just a spoilt rich girl who seems to believe she has the absolute worst lot in life when that’s so obviously not the case. When she is revealed in Whistledown there are barely any consequences. Am I supposed to believe her brothers would not be livid with her? That her Mother wouldn’t reprimand her. That she wouldn’t be under extreme monitoring from her own family to prevent further scandal? Her sister was barely caught kissing a duke and they had to marry but Eloise can openly visit Theo and have that exposed to the entire ton without consequence?

-Eloise and Penelope- It irritates me that if she had just spoken to her family about the Queen’s visit then things could’ve easily been resolved without Pen having to do what she did. Further, her judgment of Penelope is infuriating. I get that what Pen did was horrible but she did it to protect Eloise from a situation of Eloise’s own creation. Pen frequently warned Eloise not to see Theo and Eloise did not listen. Further, Eloise never ever cared what the ton thought of her before but she suddenly does when it’s in Whistledown? Yeah she should care but it feels out of character. Pen runs her own business but suddenly that’s not something that the “feminist” Eloise believes in? Pen is correct that Eloise is all talk and no action. That being said I hate what they’ve done to this friendship. The fact that Eloise pointed out that she has never truly listened to Penelope before just makes me hate Eloise even more because she is sooooo self absorbed!

-Penelope. Oh my poor Penelope. I fear you are becoming irredeemable! A shame because you were my favourite but I don’t see how you and Colin can be together after the constant harm you are doing to the Bridgerton’s. In the books her being Whistledown becomes a sort of family pride but in the show Whistledown is too mean for her actions to her own family and friends to ever be redeemable. Buttttttt....

-Scandal no longer matters. The Queen can just say a scandal is over and so it is. I suppose that’s how they’ll fix Penelope-by giving her the Queens approval. I hate that scandal means nothing now. The writers let the Antwina wedding go too far. The ton would never stop talking about how Kate and Anthony got together-it would follow them for years after this. Eloise was utterly compromised in Whistledown but absolutely no consequences for her. Not a slap on the wrist, just a few snickers from the ton. Realistically it would have destroyed her prospects and a scene of ABC slapping someone down in her honour would’ve shown that. 

-Will they won’t they? Kate’s rejections of Anthony started to get a bit ridiculous towards the end. Absolutely dragging. Even when Edwina stopped the wedding the duo spent far too long dancing around their feelings. I spent quite a bit of the episode thinking Edwina would insist that Kate marry Anthony in her stead! I miss a few scenes from the book-maybe I’m crazy but I liked the bee sting sucking in the book. It showed Anthony’s absolute desperation to prevent it from happening again. In the show I appreciate he was having a panic attack but it also looked like he was just going to let Kate die through his inaction. He should’ve at least screamed for the doctor to be in character. I also miss the carriage crash because I like angsty romance and also more Newton please!

-Edwina being angry at Kate was weird. It felt like she was blaming Kate a lot when Kate did not to her knowledge do anything. It could’ve been just Anthony having feelings for Kate and Edwina did not check that before aiming her rage at Kate. I think being an older sister myself skewed my view of this relationship somewhat-I can barely see what Kate did wrong because I feel that sense of duty too and would probably act the same if I thought it would bring my sister happiness. Keep in mind that by the wedding, Kate believed Edwina loved Anthony. By letting the wedding go on she was giving Edwina what she had expressly stated that she wanted!
I felt the pacing of the show was off. Like too many things to resolve in the final episode . I loved the first four episodes but from then on it went downhill. They took edwina and Anthony's story too far. (Spoiler) they had a perfect reason to end the engagement after the fight with shieffileds and instead just decided to drag it. Also I feel instead of redeeming Anthony's character they made a fool out of him multiple times. They should have made him stronger and see and speak his heart out at least once . The thought that Anthony would  not have stopped the wedding itself is disappointing. Even after saying all of this I feel , the lead pairs chemistry is out of the world I mean they acted with their eyes and it was just so hot.
I definitely enjoyed some changes done. For example, I liked that Anthony wasn't as aggressive in the show as he was in the books. Some changes, however, were really bad. They took the Anthony/Edwina thing way too far. The moment Anthony proposed I could feel my heart drop. To watch them make it all the way down the aisle and to see Edwina realize that Anthony and Kate were in love right there in front of everybody? I spent the next two episodes wondering how they could possibly salvage the situation. Edwina was made to be too naive and foolish while Anthony and Kate came off borderline villainous. 

I feel like we needed more Kate and Anthony. I liked their chemistry. I loved their first meeting, their argument during the horse races, Anthony's jealousy when she is being courted, and so many other scenes but I still feel like it wasn't enough. They were definitely the highlight of the season. I also enjoyed Daphne and how perceptive she was about Anthony and Kate. She was definitely given book Edwina's role.

I hate that they didn't demonstrate Mary and Kate's relationship enough. Sure, we had some moments where we saw how much Mary loved Kate but the relationship was a lot better conveyed in the books. We could have done with the scenes where Kate tells Mary she has been a mother to her in every way that counts and the scene where Mary tells Kate that when she married her father she made three vows. I would have also like a lot more Newton. Especially Newton/Mary.

I also didn't like how Kate and Edwina's relationship worked out in the series. To watch two sisters fight over a man was horrendous. One thing I liked about the show was how it gave the story an opportunity to expand on certain concepts that weren't addressed enough in the books. Edwina's entire story has been reduced to her wanting to marry Anthony. I wanted to watch her search for a true love match in a scholar, I wanted to watch her feel the pressure to marry a wealthy man like she did in the books, I wanted to see her relief when Kate falls in love with Anthony because it takes away a weight off her shoulders. Instead, we are given an Edwina whose only plot revolves around Anthony.

I also have this same problem with Mary. I wasn't interested in the whole Sheffield drama at all. I would have rather explored book Mary's story about a first husband that she did not love. I wonder if Mary's story was created just for the sake of acknowledging the fact that the Sharma family was the Sheffield family in the books.

I didn't like the change to the "I will certainly never marry Penelope Featherington" scene. For one, it feels even more cruel in the show. In the books he makes this declaration to his brothers after Violet has been pressuring him to marry and his brothers keep pushing Penelope on him. In the show, he is randomly making this declaration to a group of unknown men when he could have just said he wasn't courting her. Second of all, I liked how in the book he sees Penelope right afterwards and feels mortified about it. 

I hate to admit it, but I kind of lost respect for Violet. I understand she lost the love of her life, but the way she handled it was not it. Anthony was only 18 years old and she acknowledges he is just a child, but she is too lost in her grief to be there for him. He had just watched his father die and then was suddenly thrown into this role of Viscount overnight. He was a kid and had nobody to guide him through it because his father suddenly died and his mother disappeared wishing that Hyacinth had killed her so she could be with Edmund instead of them. This makes me even more angry thinking about all the times throughout these two seasons where Violet had stated or insinuated that he is not living up to his father. For example, in season 1 where she tells him Edmund would have found a match for Daphne already. Like, how was he supposed to know all this? He didn't have anyone to guide him after his father's death.

Really thinking about it, I think the only thing I can really rave about is Kate and Anthony, and Daphne. I did not care for the side plots. Portia was once again insufferable throughout the entire season only to end up giving some speech that makes her seem a little less awful. Eloise annoyed me and when Theo "broke up" with her the first time and told her that she was just a little rich girl I cheered. I cheered as well when Penelope told her that all she ever does is talk. Ultimately, Eloise did not come off as radical to me, but rather like a rich girl who wants to put on a progressive costume on for fun. 

All in all, I like that they didn't follow the book as much as they did with The Duke and I + season 1 because, in all honesty, they're the same book; however, the changes should have never affected the Mary/Kate/Edwina relationship or the Anthony/Edwina/Kate "triangle". I also like that the show allows us to explore beyond the main couple but all the subplots going on bored me. Benedict's art school thing didn't interest me until it was revealed he was only accepted due to Anthony's donation. I would have loved to see a lot more of Benedict, but with another plot. Eloise's never-ending investigation on Lady Whistledown and her relationship with Theo annoyed me. Lady and Lord Featherington's ruby mines scheme made me roll my eyes. 

Edit: Actually, I quite enjoyed watching Penelope run her business as Lady Whistledown. It is only the Eloise aspect of the Lady Whistledown subplot that I do not like. While it felt strange to watch Mondrich interact with the Bridgertons without Simon, by the end I thought there was potential for the character if they work harder on developing him. I did like how he helped Colin and then was repaid for it with customers for his business. It made me feel warm inside to watch him begin to succeed.

I wonder whose season we are getting next. Colin and Penelope's book happens after Colin's proclamation of never marrying her (+ I don't know if Eloise can keep the Lady Whistledown secret for very long) but Benedict is once again insecure about his art opening the door for Sophie who will encourage him to keep pursuing his passion.
Love kanthony chemistry but I couldn’t help feeling that they made Kate seem really jealous in the first few episodes? The last few not so much but I kept thinking “this is how a jealous girl would act when a boy she liked likes someone else?” Interested to get thoughts on this - just my POV 
But did love it!!!
The friendship blowup makes sense as Penelope is crueler in her persona then the books
I felt like it was too slow of a burn but that’s my only complaint
I really enjoyed the season. I LOVE Kate and Anthony. Their chemistry is unreal! 

But they cut out too many good scenes. Like Kate under Anthony’s desk, and the storm and the library was much too short. And it took too long for them to get together.

And I didn’t like what they did with Edwina’s character. They made so much conflict with their sisters, and almost ruined their relationship. I didn’t like that at all. 

But In saying that, I clearly enjoyed the season, as I watched it all in almost one sitting.
I enjoyed the season, but not enough Kate and Anthony!! There was way too much time spent on the love triangle and not enough actually developing a relationship and bond between them. The chemistry and sexual tension was great, but I wanted to see more of them as a couple. His scene when he breaks down after he finds out she's okay is fantastic though. 

Penelope has become insufferable. I hated the Whistledown plot line this season. She's tearing down everyone close to her because she thrives off of the notoriety. 

The new Lord Featherington looks like a mix between Tony Goldwyn and Matthew Goode.
What a let down… I’m super disappointed in the season. I never thought I’d say that, but it was way too long and it just dragged on forever. I actually did not enjoy the book that much, and I thought changing the story slightly was a good thing, but they really did a poor job adapting the novel. The love triangle was awful and totally unnecessary. The wedding episode felt like it would never end. Show Penelope is awful: book Penelope never did anything to harm the Bridgertons - I can see they probably want Polin’s season to have more drama.
Show colin has been an absolute bore to me for 2 seasons, he doesn't seem charming at all in my opinion, especially when compared to Benedict. Another note, I was really missing a funny berbrooke scene between Anthony, Edwina, Kate and a berbrooke. I love when they pop up lol
Literally screamed when Sir Philip Crane showed up on my screen. Gaaahd, I can’t wait for their turn. 🥹
Sorry Daphne, but Kate is officially the “Best Bridgerton Woman” in the entire series (yes I have finished the season, don’t ask me how lol). I freaking love her!
I think it was a great series, however it was like they just took the first half of the book and skipped the rest of it.  They didn't follow all the regency rules last season but this season was even worse.  The revelation about Eloise would have gotten her exiled to the country probably for the rest of her life.
I loved book plot for Kathony more than show. The whole idea with love-triangle-that-didn’t-happen, the “I won’t love you” is so much interesting and fresher than this illogical love triangle from the show. “I burn for you but you should marry my sister”. “I burn for you but I will marry your sister”. “I burn for no one but I want to be a viscountess”. I’m just disappointed. This season isn’t worth all my waiting for months.
Kanthony had so much chemistry! But why was I made to watch a wedding that didn't happen as opposed to the one wedding I wanted to see? I wanted to see post wedding Kanthony! The Lady Whistledown plot line with Penelope is driving me insane at how bad it's gowing. Penelope and Colin are my favorites alongside Michael (oh god pls let them show us Michael and the table sceneeee 😩) and Francesca, and Kanthony.

I really dislike what Eloise has become it feels like she's a cheap shot or a caricature of what her character should be.

NOT ENOUGH NEWTON!
Anthony's panicked scene with the bee was amazing!!! Great acting. I wish the writers would have went with it more; used it to bring out his inner conflict of loving Kate and not wanting to be hurt. The scene went by too fast. But it was awesome how Kate calmed him down in the show, compared to the book when it took her awhile to figure it out.   


If they had turned that up and turned down Edwina's anger (maybe, as others have suggested, not taken it as far down the aisle, and also let Edwina be more forgiving because Kate and Anthony were trying to do what's right), then the writers could have concentrated more on Anthony's love/hurt inner conflict. And progressed the story to Kate/Anthony's wedding, and then spent more time after the wedding and their relationship building.   


The bee scene, Anthony's crying when he found out Kate had woken up, the sadness about his father... it was awesome to see men's emotion and vulnerability being shown. And it didn't take away from their perceived manliness at all.
I'm really surprised at how bad they are making each character out to be. How is Penelope going to be redeemed enough to become a Bridgerton? Or how will they repair the friendship between Penelope and Eloise? And how will they repair all the relationships they've broken? Benedict's mistrust of Anthony? 

I really loved the sisterly bond and the banter between Kate and Edwina, and the show ruined it. Having two women — sisters who grew up and loved each other so much — fight over a man. Ugh. Such a tired old trope.

And I also cannot understand why they removed the library scene, Kate's trauma, and how they found each other. The chemistry between Bailey and Ashley is so good that it's a shame we didn't see more of them sparring on-screen.
The Featheringtons are such a boring part of the series.
There's a lot lacking from this season. I went back to the books and while I love the changes they made with the Sheffields' inheritance and Kate's character, the crucial mistake was the changes to Edwina's character.

Having Edwina fall in love with Anthony was a bad move. The problem is that the bee sting would've no longer been a good reason for show!Kate to marry Anthony (she'd just leave for India like she planned), but if Edwina had fallen in love with an untitled, middle-class scholar and would be disinherited if they were to marry, now Kate has to decide whether to have her freedom or give her sister happiness.

I was also disappointed they took away her fear of storms. Being able to show that both these people have trauma from their parents' untimely deaths was one of the best parts of the books.
I've read a few interviews from the team lately and they seem to be majorly hinting that next season will be Penelope and Colin focused. Basically going out of order. I can't say I'm particularly thrilled. They have no chemistry and I find them to be my least favorite characters of the show. It'll be hard for me to get into. I haven't read the books though- is their love story in the books great?
About four episodes in I found myself wondering why the fuck there were so many side plots. By episode six, I was just exasperated. I can’t believe the focus of this season was essentially relegated to the last 12 minutes.  Happy I’m not the only one with those feels. 

I found myself missing so many bits from the book, like the Library scene. Having PTSD and panic attacks myself, I found that scene particularly touching. Gone. Poof. 

And Edwina. By episode 6 or 7, I just was rolling my eyes with her incessant scolding. Kate just got gaslit all season and they made her out to be some monster for something you cannot control: falling in love. 

And the constant “oh we can’t.” Ahh can’t you marry her? After the deal with the Sheffields falls apart, I thought that would be the opening for them to steer the plot to Kate. Nope. Full steam ahead with that exhausting wedding episode. And then not even a wedding for Kathony. 

I enjoyed the last 40 minutes of the last episode but by the time we got there, I wasn’t even very happy about the payoff. I was just tired having waited for it for so long.
I was annoyed that show-Edwina didn't realize that, yes, Kate and Anthony had feelings for each other, but they were both setting that aside for her feelings/sense of duty. They were willing to take it all the way to the alter. They were trying to be selfless. It would have been better to focus her anger on being treated like a child, which now that I'm watching it again is painful.
The whole season was disappointing. They dragged the romance out and destroyed Kate's character. Why add the Sheffield plot? Why take them all the way to the alter? Why destroy the sisterly relation? For cheap drama? 

I am a game of thrones fans and was similiarly disappointed from the way  they ended it. But....bridgerton had books to reference!!! The viscount who loved me was one of my favorites. It seemed like they wanted to develop every othergarbage plot instead of Anthony and Kates. They missed the whole point of the reason for Anthony's reluctance at love. 

So many missed opportunities. Kinda harsh but... They can stop the series now before ruining other characters.
Most has already been said so just the two things I missed to most from the books:

I too would have loved an Edwina that just didn't care for Anthony because he wasn't intellectual enough but would marry him out of duty and going on with the courting doing and saying "all the right things". And then Kate and Anthony being the same idiots out of duty. That would have been amusing to watch I think.

But what I really missed, and I can see how it didn't work with her show characterisation, was Kate learning an Instrument and being bad at it, just because it was fun. We hear this so often in costume dramas, how ladies of the time had to be accomplished to have the biggest market value and the marriage market, and her doing it for fun while being very bad spoke a lot of her character (als about her approach to perfectionism in relation to Anthony's). *

They painted her more serious in the show, and I kinda miss that sparkle of joy she had in the book.  I would have been happy showing her playing around with Newton in the garden or something to show her fun side (that's Bering repressed for duty, etc etc)



* I don't mean this in a "not like other girls" way, because she is very proper in the book, but she does have an independent/unconventional streak about her.
For all the steamy setup between Kate and Anthony, I’m really disappointed we didn’t see more physical passion between them. They seemed so lustful for each other but their sex scene is so… mediocre
What in the name of all angst was that?.... everything drugged out so long. They took a beloved historical romance trope and flogged it to death 😭
I was so not invested in Anthony and Kate, ...if I hadn't read the book, I probably wouldn't be okay with them.
So much second hand embarrassed.


Also why ruin Pen and Eloise?
Can someone spoil me a bit on the stuff with Anthony's father? What episode(s) might be hardest for someone who recently lost a parent? I'm still going to watch but want to be prepared and make sure to watch anything really emotional when I have the house to myself. Thanks!
I guess they want to establish a bigger, more complex and dramatic world for later seasons but did they really think the audience wanna see some side plots for like half of each episode?

And then only gave us 10 mins of Kate and Anthony being a happy couple???
I think what bugs me the most, which I see others share, is how Kanthonys story felt rushed at the end, especially with all of the other plots that they added. While I could have done without the Featherington plot entirely, if they hadn’t strayed that far from the original Kanthony story, I think they would have had plenty of room to tell it and all their subplots. They went so off course in plausibility with the Edwina/Anthony storyline that they had to spend a lot of time course correcting to get the HEA for Kanthony. If they just stayed truer to the book, they would have had more time for that and it would have fit even with the other subplots. It’s so frustrating!!
At least they didn’t have Anthony and Kate married because everyone saw Anthony sucking out the “venom” from Kate’s collarbone bee sting. Sometimes being disloyal to the original plot is a good thing!!
all i can say is they riverdaled this season
Things I liked:
The casting of Anthony and Kate. I loved watching them. They added lots of little things that showed that they fully understood who their characters were. 

Things I liked to have seen more of or differently:
- the relationship between Mary and Kate. I really loved them in the book and I understand the whole adaptations yada yada, but I missed delving into that as it informs so much of both of their characters. I specifically missed that Mary kept looking out for a husband for Kate too. Kate is overlooked by many, but not by Edwina and Mary.
- Edwina knowing what kind of husband she wants but also feeling the pressure to provide for her family. She was pretty vapid in the show. I also thought it was weird that she accused Kate of betraying her and foisting Kate’s dreams upon her when it very much was Edwina who kept pushing for Anthony and in the end Kate kept silent because Edwina made it pretty clear she wanted to marry Anthony.
Does anybody else feel like the chemistry between Kate and Anthony was forced??
Maybe I would have liked the season better if I didn’t read the books but I do not know. As many felt but I may repeat I liked Kate’s backstory better in the book. Seeing her mother’s death and that gave her the fear of storms, the library desk scene, and the ptsd from the storm once they were sleeping together during the post marriage. Maybe if both actors decide to stay on they can touch on some of the post wedding conflicts in future seasons but I find it doubtful. 

I didn’t like the love triangle since been towards the end I couldn’t figure out how the two main people would end up together. I liked the tension between Anthony and Kate but I felt the kiss in the chapel so forced and not the first kiss I was waiting for all season. 

I liked the ex boxer being back in the show snd seeing him be a part of the society. 

I think just comparing the Netflix adaptions I liked the first season better. 

Looking forward to watching the future seasons. Please don’t butcher Benedict. He was a star this season and I cannot wait to see his match on the screen

Thank you for reading my rant / TED talk
Edwina was so much cringe. The actress was beautiful but I hated the wide eyed, breathless look in every scene. For someone who was shown to be very close with her sister, her lack of perception and basic observation regarding her sister was mind numbing. 
Chemistry between the main leads was the only good thing in this season.
I dont like that they made edwina be so intent on marrying Anthony. Even my mom kept saying like every episode “oh she knows. She’s gotta know. She’s pushing them together on purpose cmon look” but then…. No, she’s just super mad. I feel like how angry she got didn’t even align with who they started out portraying her as in the show version? Like I get she was mad at her for lying about it or kinda making her look dumb or setting her up for a doomed/loveless marriage etc etc but edwina yelled at kate like 3 or 4 separate times— and one of them was about how kate was somehow selfish for trying to give everything to edwina?? Huh?? I think I get what they were trying to do, but that part especially didn’t work imo. 

And yeah I agree with the comments saying they would’ve preferred a little less of the featheringtons. I like them, don’t get me wrong, but the same “we have no money hehe we’re swindling” convo/scene seemed to happen multiple times 😩

Also I love lady Danbury but sometimes she just feels like a 2nd narrator, but a narrator for the characters if that makes sense 🤔 

OH and did that Eloise plot happen in the books? I cant remember but I was kinda hoping they do something different for her bc i dont like the actor they picked for Phillip 😭 #GiveEloiseANewLoveInterest
I’m…shockingly happy with all of the changes and believe the adaptation was better than the book. The slow burn almost killed me. One of the best I’ve seen.

The fleshing out of Violet’s trauma and the taming of Anthony’s/Kate’s really worked for me, idk.
I am disappointed in this season. I was looking forward to seeing Kate and Anthony’s relationship. I knew they would drift away from the book, but I loved how they did S1 so had a lot of excitement about where they would take S2. 

My main issue is that they didn’t show enough of Kate and Anthony growing on an emotional level. There was little to nothing to show their vulnerability with each other. The bee sting scene was amazing, but it’s after that where they lost me. I wish they had utilized the scene in the library. If not for anything else, at least to show Kate being vulnerable with Anthony. The enemies to lovers trope was expected, but I feel as though they muddied the water by dragging it out as long as they did. I would’ve liked to have seen Anthony get to know Kate on a more emotional level. They did flashbacks with Simon’s background, I would’ve liked to have seen the same with Kate and her mother. I didn’t not feel an emotional connection as I did with Daphne and Simon. 

I wish they had portrayed both Edwina and Penelope differently. I think their characters deserved more. 

I felt like the scene in the gazebo was rushed and confusing to watch.
I thought Mary was quite weak in the series. In the book Mary is so crucial in the story and you feel her love for Kate way more
While I loved Kate and Anthony as played by Simone and Jonathan, I thought that it would have been more romantic if they had taken a few more scenes from JQ, cut two episodes out, and, of course NO LOVE TRIANGLE!! The love triangle is the worst! Stressful and good characters get hurt. One of the cute things about the book is what an idiot Anthony is, and that comes through in part because he has 0 feelings for Edwina and she has 0 for him. It just made his 'plan' all the more endearingly stupid. Also, part of the fantasy of romance novels is that friends and family (as long as they are not cast as villains from the start) always get along. That is what makes romances warm and fuzzy. Eliminate that at your peril, scriptwriters! I felt like the script had a better handle on romance as a genre in S1. The story succumbed to too many dumb and easy plot twists this season.
Can someone tell me, I watched it all last night, that Benedict never has any $3x with anyone right? Unless I somehow missed it. So why did that one review state he has more than the main couple?
I loved Kate and Anthony- wished they showed more of them ! 

I couldn’t care less about the featherington plot that took way too much time. Same with the who is lady whistle down plot.

Penelope… yeah I do not get the writers love for her I really don’t.

Episodes 1-5 were great IMO. 6-8 dragged on with the featherington plot and not enough kanthony
Random question: I know the Bridgerton sibs have worn/are wearing bees on their clothing a lot (Benedict’s bee vest comes to mind), but does Anthony ever? Because my theory is Anthony saw Edmund die from the bee, and it traumatized the heck out of him, whereas his younger siblings were probably told an Anthony-truncated version of the truth and they are more able to see the bee as a symbol for Edmund, and less of a traumatic loss.

I wonder if Violet has worn bees, either. I know Benedict and Eloise both have.
I found s2 to be so disappointing, and I am not a fan of what they did to Kate’s character - they made her petty, sly and literally move in on her sisters fiancé. Making Edwina have interest in Anthony, and having A + E become engaged at the house party instead of A + K ruined the story for me. Also emphasising boring storyline’s (i.e everything featherington) instead of focusing on A + K just highlights the painfully slow pacing!
Like others have said, this season was meh compared to the first season. The Kate-Edwina rivalry and lack of Edwina not wanting to marry for money really tarnished the season. I also wish they had done more with the thunderstorm scene in the library. Where was the emotional closeness between Kate and Anthony? It def. felt like the love story had been interpreted by a guy. That being said, the costumes and scenery were beautiful and I did enjoy the change to Eloise’s story with Theo instead of Sir Phillip. The bee scene was also nicely done and not as outlandish as in the book. But overall, the book was better.
I am not seeing anyone talk about how they cut out the library scene in which Kate is afraid of the storm and Anthony comforts her. It's my favorite scene
Seeing how they changed this season from the book, I see a lot changing with Benedict's season as well. In particular, >!the whole Sophie going to prison plot point!<. It was just as cheesy as >!Anthony trying to suck the bee sting from Kate's neck!< in his book so I'm guessing they'll be a different height to Benedict and Sophie's romance. We also haven't seen him draw the line between classes like Anthony did with Siena which I think might change his attitude towards >!Sophie only being his mistress.!< I do hope they keep in >!how much sex the two had before they get married, it was very steamy !<and would be a nice contrast to the first two seasons.
I don't have many positive things to say about this season, because I'm still in shock. I was impressed when Shonda said she read the books and wanted to see them onscreen, but I wasn't expecting her to completely rewrite Kate and Anthony's story. I also wasn't expecting such ugly portrayals of Kate, Eloise, or Anthony. It still boggles the mind as to why they chose not to put the full library scene onscreen, it was one of the most beautiful scenes from the book. And why did they change part of the story of Edmund's death? Eloise was with him when he died, not Anthony. I'm trying to watch it for a 2nd time, but between the nonsense story with the Featheringtons, and the complete rewrite of the story, it's tough.
It felt so much messier than it needed to be. I honestly am frustrated too that they didn’t explore Anthony falling in love with Kate after they got married. 

We’ve all seen a million love triangles. They’re not that interesting. 

But I am excited for the build up for pen and Colin
Am I truly the only one who cringed when he said Kathoni instead of Katherine?
I miss that the entire arch isn't built upon marriage, but on the relationship. I wish they would have kept some of the story where Anthony and Kate were married and then had to work more on their relationship.
I see a lot of people who read the book miss the library/storm scene, but I don't care that it's gone. I rolled my eyes through that part of the book. Seemed more fetishizing women as children or helpless to me.
Do you think Theo will be back? I’m not quite sure that felt like a serious ending
I don’t like how they totally changed Kate’s personality. In the book she is nurturing and the show made her too harsh. The books Edwina felt the pressure of finding a match and Kate knew she felt it and wanted to help remove as much pressure as she could by being the gatekeeper to meeting Edwina. The show made Kate too controlling and forcing herself to be the gatekeeper and Edwina does not seem to want it but goes along with it.  I also miss the relationship between Mary and the sisters. It was very lacking in the show.
Truly aggravating how much they changed the book to show adaptation. For book Edwina to not even be a little attracted to Anthony, to being in love with him in the show??? Then for the show to be like 30% featheringtons, 30% eloise, and barely 40% Kate and Anthony?? I was so disinterested with the supposed main couple by the end of the show, they ruined their relationship…
I just read an article that interviewed the writers and directors of S2 and they were discussing the justification of not showing Anthony and Kate's wedding etc. The main reason being they didn't want to have 2 weddings back to back. It's like I get it, but Edwina's wedding to Antnony wasn't supposed to even happen grrrr. So we didn't get a Kanthony wedding b/c of a crazy change up to the story from the show writers🤦‍♀️smh. Come on, a quick glimpse of them kissing at the alter would have been nice and a few extra scenes as a married couple...
I just have to say, I am SO RELIEVED this thread exists, because browsing the subreddit has me feeling like I’m taking crazy pills for not being obsessed with this latest season. The screen adaptation did Kate and Edwina soooo dirty, not to mention shoehorned in plot lines literally no one cares about (uh, fake ruby Featheringtons? Snore!). The whole Kate/Edwina rivalry was so forced, and the writers neutered Kate’s entire backstory. The romance between her and Anthony limped along until just before the very end. 

Also wish they’d just left Daphne out of this one since the actor playing Simon didn’t return. Daphne’s role could easily have been fulfilled by any of the other siblings, like Eloise, for example. She needed something to balance her out this season. Or Francesca! Why bring her in at all when we have little to no investment in her from season 1?

Gah. Clearly I have feelings about season 2. I really wanted to love it, which makes it all the more deflating.
I didn’t love the show so much that I read the book in a whole two nights. I think they just did so many things wrong, even counting the few amazing things done well.

I’ve only read the first two books, so I have no clue about anything going in. I read the first after the first season. 

My favorite thing this entire season is Eloise and Theo. But I really really really did not enjoy the last episode for both El and Colin. God, how privileged and entitled can you get? They need a lot of help if they are going to redeem themselves in my eyes.  I wish the books and the show would find a way to meet in the middle. I feel like potential is wasted this season. I’ll still rewatch Daphne any day though!
Just started reading the book and I have to say I’m so glad they ditched the “my sister is so much prettier than me” theme, instead they made Kate strong and smart and witty, instead of clunky and awkward. I think it works so much better on screen. I do wish they had toned down the Edwina triangle and given her her real suitor, it went on much too long.
so okay like i haven’t read the books yet but i did read the summary for Eloise’s book and i’m so sad. like really Eloise and Sir Phillip Crane?!!?!!! the guy that’s married to Marina?! I really hope Shonda Rhimes switch things up bc i’m a HUGE Eloise and Theo fan. But the most I feel like Shonda would do is throw in Theo as an obstacle for Eloise but eventually have Eloise end up with Sir Phillip so she can still follow the book’s plot. any thoughts?
I loved Kate/Anthony. The chemistry was insane but I also wanted more of Theo/Eloise 💜💜💜
Overall I really liked the season. I do like the book plot more, but I can see how some areas overlap with the first season (male lead “not interested” in female lead at first, develop attraction, incident caused rushed marriage, ML has some sort of trauma so he can’t give FL what she wants, messy fight, everyone makes up and FL gets what she wanted) though tbh I would’ve rather they changed last seasons plot more than this season. 

Normally I’m a slut for love triangles (I love angst) but this one went on too far, I do wish Edwina realized Kate and Anthony liked each other early on, or at the very least that Anthony and Edwina didn’t have a wedding. 

I understand Penelope’s importance but I really wish they didn’t do that whole story line with Mrs. Featherington (or the cousin and other daughters). Especially since the cousin just ended up leaving at the end of the season anyway and all that was done so the Featheringtons would now have money. For a show called Bridgerton they sure do focus a lot on a different family. Without all those scenes we could’ve gotten so much more Kanthony. Also it was really weird that Mrs.Featherington had an attraction to her daughters fiancé

Anyway, I really hope we get more Kate and Anthony in the next season since I low key feel deprived. I also wonder what will happen with that dude who was kinda courting Kate. Ngl I was kinda hoping he would show up and talk to Kate like one more time just to see Anthony get jealous again (I love angst). Also I really liked how they integrated Lady Danbury this season

Finally, Jonathan Bailey is so freaking hot.
Too much of Anthony and Edwina, it meant less time for Kate and led to the dramatic scenes of the two families being shunned which, in my opinion, was a waste of time. I get that they didn’t want to do a forced marriage thing again but they could have cut to Anthony and Kate’s romance quicker. 

I wish they had included the library scene from the book. It’s the most romantic scene in all the bridgerton books (imo) and they had the time because they touched on it. They could have easily had Anthony find her crying/screaming instead of “I saw a light”. The explanation for why she hates thunderstorms in the book is clunky and could have stayed omitted in the show. 

I don’t think they made a big enough deal of Anthony initially not wanting to marry for love because of fear of his own mortality. They could have even kept that theme stronger with what they did establish of him not wanting to lose someone he loves/they lose him. I wish they had made it clear that he was courting Edwina 90-100% because he could never love her but could like her and then switched to Kate once he realized he must marry for love
Some pacing aside, I liked this a lot better than S1, even with all of the liberties taken. It felt more substantial to me.

I was actually happy they cut out the mortality thing…it wasn’t my favorite part of the book, and it wouldn’t have probably been difficult to write it to screen. I do wish they had the Newton chase, but am glad he was in the series :)

My heart is broken for Eloise and Pen, as they’re two of my favorite characters. I’m glad they put that in there, and am eager to see what comes next.

The mine subplot was interesting, but they could have axed the relationship bit with the daughter. 

Regarding Edwina, loved her character growth, but it would have been nice if they also cut her “love” for Anthony. The triangle could have been tidied up slightly more.
I'm sad at how the focus was on sub-plots and not the Kate/Anthony set up on the books. I'm mostly just happy there's a new show runner because Benedict is such a fun character so far and I really hope his season isn't spent with the focus primarily on the Featheringtons (both Portia and Penelope had so much screen time). I'm so bummed about the Eloise/Pen falling out.
My book to Netflix thoughts: SPOILERS

1- I love that the Sheffield’s became the Sharmas. I can now no longer think of Kate as a brunette white lady. Her being Indian just fits so well.  Much of this must be credited to the talented Simone Ashley! But their coming from India made it so much more interesting. I loved the nicknames of Didi and Bon.


2-  Edwina ... I think I prefer the version of her from the book. In the book I don’t recall that Edwina had any real interest in Anthony. They certainly didn’t get to the altar.  She wanted true love for both her and her sister.  She was angling early on for Kate and Anthony get together.  In the book, she was more of an intellectual, and she married a second son and scholar, Mr. Bagwell. And I love that Anthony provided a dowery for her.  One Shondaland addition I approved of however, was there was more backstory with her grandparents trying to manipulate things with a potential dowery. It did make things more interesting, And also made more sense as to why Kate was so focused on Edwina’s matching. Also I’m glad that the sisters had at least one disagreement on Netflix. In the book they never disagreed.

3-  Anthony and trauma. I appreciate how in the Netflix series that they give Anthony a better reason for not searching for a “love match“. In the book he had this stupid idea that he could not possibly outlive his father. That he would be dead in nine years. In the series they revamped that to something more relatable, that he didn’t want to hurt anyone or be hurt be hurt by anyone the way his mother was. This was worsened by the fact that Anthony had to go from childhood to man responsible for an entire family and Viscountdom in a second.  Anthony’s trauma rang so much more true in the Netflix series. However, I think deleting Kate’s storm phobia, also deleted an aspect of their relationship.

4- Pall mall.  Nope.. they changed the players. I liked the way the book did it. In the book it was Daphne, Simon, Anthony, Kate, Edwina, and Collin. And they liked this setup so much that they did it every year. In the second epilogue, they were having their 15th annual Pall mall competition. Even Mrs Edwina Bagwell would travel to attend this sacred event.  However, I do like they added in Eloise. But in the books, this really wasn’t Benedict’s thing.

5. Francesca. Something I don’t like in either the book or the series, Is that Francesca was barely exists until her book. I would like to see her better developed.
Agreeing with all of the comments on chemistry being great, not loving that the desk scene wasn’t included, and then dialling back the storm scene and general complexity behind Kate.

On a different note - also did not love how Lady Bridgerton and Lady Danbury were written. I feel like Violet was less meddling and maternal and more overbearing than in the books and then the dynamic between Danbury and Kate (and pretty much every other female lead) was way more hostile (than the few if any interactions they had). Honestly, Kate without some of her backstory just made her feel more abrasive than in the book. They really did all of the female characters so dirty.
I’m baffled by how they managed to make me like season 1 so much better, when they now had a far superior story and better leads (still like Phoebe and Rege (!!), but I love Simone and Johnny). The fact that they chose to change/omit so much, when they kept terrible stuff in the first season (one thing in particular!), which they should have absolutely scrapped, is beyond me!
A LOT of chemistry between Kate and Anthony… only up until they kiss though. For some reason when they kiss it looks so unbalanced? One goes too fast, one opens their mouth too wide, when they connect it just doesn’t look as smooth as it should. Did anyone else feel that way??
I’m really really curious what direction the show is intending on going with Eloise.  I loved getting to see Sir Phillip in that one episode.  He seemed very spot on to the books.  I just don’t see the jump being made to Eloise and him making their connection.  Maybe the show will go a different route?  Im certainly interested to find out.

I watched the first season of the show before realizing the series was adapted from the books.  I always felt it was a bit of a jump that Eloise fell like she did for Sir Phillip (mostly based off how she was portrayed in the show).  I wouldn’t hate it if they brought her in a different direction, but if they do stay true to the books I’m excited to see what they do with the story.
I really like Edwina, but I want her to fail. 

I want a character who fails to get their true-love match. And I don't just mean Marina. I kind of like Marina and sympathize with how she had to deal with the pregnancy and courting situation, but that's also why it's "excusable". She did something wrong ("sex before marriage is a scandal", but mainly trying to trap Colin), and didn't get her happy ending. Or we excuse characters who aren't the prettiest or smartest from getting their happy ending because they're "less than". Or how Cressida is miserable because she has a miserable personality.   


I want a character who does everything right, but still doesn't get a happy ending because that's real life. Guess I'll have to wait to see next season and keep rooting against her.
I must speak to someone about this because I am truly on edge! Spoilers for Book 5 about Eloise and her story in this season! Please stop reading if you do not already know, I do not know how to censor on mobile, I apologize.

I must say, her character is my favourite, I care little for most of the others when compared to her. 

>!However, I strongly believe that the "love" story she undergoes in the books with the old, rich, plant-boy with children is out of place for her character in the series. 

Moreover, Philip is awful to her, toxic disgusting, controlling, "if I am happy you should be too", they don't share anything whatsoever and she deserves more than that clise. She is just a nanny to him, a trophy, he does not even challenge her in any other way but sexually which threads closely to being creepy.

 They don't even have the necessary connection of Marina, and Theo is a brand new character, I don't see why make these changes and then throw them out...

While some might not agree, I would prefer it if the series would go on with her current beliefs and wisdom, pursuing a love outside the norms of society, with a poor boy others deem unworthy while he obviously makes her feel what none other could. 

And it cannot be anyone else other than Theo.!< Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Loved Phillip - must keep him with Eloise!! No Theo (cute as he was) and no Marina!
Simone and Jonathan have such great chemistry, it‘s insane.

Seems to be a hot take, but I def enjoyed this season more than TVWLM - even though the end was w a y too rushed in my opinion. I wouldn‘t have needed the wedding either but pretty much every other change was a great idea imo. 
I‘m especially glad we didn‘t have the bee scene like in the book and of course the „rights-denied“ stuff. 
I just wonder how they‘ll redeem Pen, I love that Lady W has a bigger role than in the books but I really hope they have a plan.
I’m only on episode 5 but I’m excited to see if Theo and Eloise pan out and and what they’ll do for Gregory if they get the chance. Why do you think they introduced Lucy, Marina, and Phillip so early?
This is my opinion.   
These are some of the things I disliked from Bridgerton Season 2  
1. Eloise and Theo  
From the start I disliked that they introduce a new guy character to Eloise that might seem like something that could turn into a romance story. She’s independent, smart and searching for more in life, I believe they should have made her more focused on learning more about herself and exploring new things, before they introduce her love interest. (\*no offense to the Calam Lynch (Theo actor)….he’s cute..yes )  
In the end, When Penelope tells Eloise she’s doing nothing in her life..I have to agree. Eloise is wasting her time. She could be doing many more things other than searching for lady whistledown.  
She reminds me of Sybil in downtown abbey. I hope they give Eloise a better story as the show continue.  
2.Eloise finding out about Penelope  
Why?? I know that movies change from books…but why did they have to make Eloise find out about Penelope that way. Her story is far away, and if the writers are deciding to switch things up and focus on a different sibling before another, it still does not explain why they would already make Eloise find out about Penelope and ruin their friendship. Eloise finding out about Penelope could have been an amazing reveal in her story or Penelope’s.   
3. Edwina Reaction to Kate and Anthony  
I cannot remember the books reaction but I believe she wasn’t so love struck by Anthony that she would react in the way she did ( and continue to act) when she found out about him and her sister’s relationship. I guess it has to do with the whole storyline of the season🙈  
4. All the different stories in one love story  
I’ve read many saying it was confusing/distracting that the episode focused on so many different stories about the other families or people, resulting in less of Kate and Anthony, and I agree to a certain points. I enjoyed them trying to give us more on the featherington, especially since Penelope play and important role in the story, but they could have tone it down a bit ( especially since they are  trying to give use more of Benedict, Colin, and all the others.) In the end, it’s Kate and Anthony story. It’s important to ensure their story grows together.  
\*\* Please remember this is my opinion and I mean no offense to anyone\*\*  
\*\*Sorry for grammar errors/misspelled word or any other issues\*\*  
Thank you to the writers, directors, actors, and everyone who contributed to The Bridgerton show. I look forward for many more.
I am so, so glad that they limited the bee situation and cut out Anthony’s bizarre “I can never love because I will die young” schtick. I think the slow burn was actually done really well, and while I missed some scenes (desk in the library scene, as mentioned by others) and some details (Edwina wanting to marry a scholar), I thought that this season was actually done really thoughtfully. I couldn’t finish season one because I hate Daphne so much, but I was looking forward to season 2 and think it delivered. One other quibble - where was franchesca?? She was in like two scenes, but hyacinth and Gregory were around. Does this mean they likely plan to stop after Eloise’s story (which I also don’t think is going to work well with the current storyline she’s set up).
I actually preferred Edwina to Kate. I found Kate grating and there didn’t feel like super much build up between Kate and Anthony other than physical.
I have not read the books,  though I am originally planning to.  Can someone tell me some of the differences between this season and the book?
Why is everyone so obsessed with Newton?
Edit: I found many think the same here. 
LIBRARY SCENE!!!
In the book, the library scene is the time when Kate and Anthony really connect.

Kate is afraid of lightning, because her mom died in the night of storm and lightning. That coincides with Anthony's fear of bees that caused his father's death. 

Kate hides under the desk. Anthony finds her because the light is still on. Anthony crawls under the desk, hold Kate's hands, and they talk about their family. 

It is a shame that the library scene is so brief in the show. It's supposed to be a moment of connection; but writers chose to let them fight in the scene.

If only the library scene is played out according to the book, it would be so perfect I am sure more will find it an upgrade compared to S1.
Glad the fake boobs were toned down in the second season. Lady Bridgerton's costume was embarrassing at Daphne's wedding in season one. It wasn't because she was older or Daphne's mom, it was just the wrong moment being her daughter's wedding, especially when none of her other dresses were cut like that. 

The costume and wigs were overall much improved this season. The Queen's hair, in particular, was stunning, and Daphne's wig looked more natural, but you could easily see the Featherington's real hair beneath their wigs. I'm looking forward to Pen's glow-up when she finally gets to choose her own hair and dresses with some of that money she's earned.
It bothered me that Daphne called him Antony but Violet said Anthony.
Do you think Lady Danbury really did know and control everything about Anthony and Kate (like she always does) or was it truly out of her control throughout the whole season?
Hi everyone, new to this sub.

I feel like the (Netflix) Anthony archetype is *very* similar to a character in an old Regency romance titled *Slightly Dangerous*.  The main character in that book is the head of a very big family, assumed the patriarch role young.  He worked to provide for his siblings, tended his estates, tenants, finances, and was guided by his duties all the time, and viewed himself as sacrificing his happiness for his responsibilites.  In that book the romantic interest was an independent young widow that was below his class.  Anybody read that book?  Also the author (Mary Balogh) wrote another book in which the male protagonist married a nobody so he could spite his dying father, *The Temporary Wife*.  I haven't read the *Bridgerton* books, not making any assertion of plot stealing here, merely pointing out that the plot tumbler creates many similarly complicated heroes.  Now that Netflix has found success with this genre + lush production values, I wonder if the Georgette Heyer and Victoria Holt books will eventually be adapted for the screen.  Netflix has already adapted *Rebecca*, which I think is very close to the Victoria Holt modern gothic style.
I did not understand that weird Netflix plot twist about some Sheffield promise to marry a nobleman. That was so random and lame - If either sister married Anthony, he would certianly have provided for the unmarried sister and mother. Duh! Where was the drama in that? I read that Netflix wouldn't even allow critics to reveal that so-called 'surprise twist', which, incidentally, seemed to disappear as fast as it appeared. Not to mention that it would seem to cast Kate in a mercenary light - so opposite to who she is as a character in both the show and the book. Why, Netflic, why, when JQ offers you so many other good possible avenues? Why not just include some of those great scenes like Kanthony's introduction at the ball, or when Anthony visits and brings flowers for Kate - surely one of the most charming and romanting moments in all of JQ - why not include those and cut the dreck?
I'm so glad this exists so I can rant somewhere without offending my friends who loved season 2!

I thought it was bad and should feel bad. The series writers were always going to have to embellish quite a bit just because the source material is weak AF, but their choices were inconsistent with the time period, with the genre, with common sense, and what people liked in season 1. I hated how far they took Anthony and Edwina (all the way to the altar? Really?). They gave Kanthony all these scenes alone together, which doesn't make sense for society in that period and isn't even consistent with their own Lord Featherington storyline. They ignored almost all of Kate's back story and trauma in favor of more attention on her sister and more longing looks with Anthony. Moreover, the pain book Kate feels at thinking her husband will never love her is much more compelling than 7 episodes of "I must get Edwina married." They also ignored Anthony's irrational fear of dying young, which according to the author is a common thing for men who lost their dad early so that would've been interesting to explore. Instead it was turned into a generic, "If I love someone then I'll be sad when they die and vice versa."

Yes the forced marriages in book 1 AND book 2 were repetitive (again, weak source material) but the way they wrote this season left a giant plot hole-- why the fuck could he not marry Kate rather than Edwina? They had him clearly wanting Kate before proposing to her sister, and there was no real impetus to force him all the way down the aisle. The bracelet thing was so stupid! He loves her so much he can't help a longing look AT the altar in front of all of society?? Then why is he there? There isn't a strong enough motive in the story the show writers created.

Idk, I didn't think this season made enough sense to justify the love I've seen for it. I tuned in for costumes and sexy times and we barely got the latter (the Kanthony sex was nonsensical and no one can change my mind!). Yes, I'm super fun at parties...
Screwing Edwina over at the altar was 1000% wrong. It’s even worse than when Edith was left by Anthony Stralen.
Totally agree!! I loved that dynamic between the sisters in the book and felt uncomfortable that in the show Edwina developed actual feelings for her future brother-in-law. So very messy.
I miss the warmth and understanding between the sisters as well as Mary and Kate!
This is EXACTLY how I felt! It took what was an understandable situation in the book, where Edwina noticed how much Kate and Anthony liked each other from early on, and turned it into a situation where I kept thinking "How the fuuuuu are they going to come back from this?" over and over again for the entire season.
Yes this is my biggest issue. I loved in book how Edwina had her own ideas of an ideal husband and she meets someone in the background while Anthony and Kate are sparing. This version makes her a brat that I didn't sympathize with (though I did like that she was able to stand up for herself).
Agreed I did not love them putting two women against each other for absolutely no reason other than to make it dramatic. Edwina and Kate are so supportive to each other in the book. Edit: Spelling
Yes and she saw that she didn’t actually have much in common with him & Kate has more in common with him
I get this, but I also wonder how difficult it would be to stretch their story over an entire season without a true obstacle. What would prevent them from getting together halfway through, just Anthony's stubbornness and issues with his father's death? It's hard to imagine that holding them back when their attraction was so strong, and I hate when the only substantial reason two characters haven't gotten together yet is that the plot requires it. Edwina was a true, believable obstacle for both of them. It also felt more realistic to me that Edwina would have some stronger feelings in this situation and that switching from one sister to the other would have some significant fallout, not just about Anthony but about Kate's dishonesty and manipulation. The book version was sweet, but I'm not surprised the show took it in a different direction.

ETA: I do wish they had stopped short of the wedding! That was one drama too far for me. And so cringe.
Exactly! What a disservice to baby sharma. Major cliche for pitting the two sisters against each other and the irony is that she had been portrayed as a ditz throughout the series and suddenly becoming woke enough to realise something was off at the altar??

Her character in the book was so much more self-aware and their sibling relationship much healthier.
Agreed, I’ve been on the fence about watching the second season because I’ve heard that they changed a lot from the book but I was watching a YouTube list today and heard that they made it a love triangle story and it was an instant no for me. Kate and Edwina’s sisterhood and love for each other, and Kate’s love for her stepmom, I loved that part of the story. I wish they didn’t take it out and change it so much.
Finally decided to watch season two yesterday. (Finished this morning...) and I came to say this!!

I was so disappointed that they fell back to the usual cliché of betrayal and love triangles when in the books it was just such a delight that Edwina was smart and kind enough to actually acknowledge the spark between the two and encourage it.

Also, in the books she wasn't quite as clueless about the state of their family, and imo it was much better that way. She could have still been uninformed about the inheritance, but a smart woman like her, I highly doubt she would be such a hopeless romantic. I guess it changed in the wedding episode, but before that she was shown absolutely in love with Anthony, a little bit too much.
They had SO much chemistry!
