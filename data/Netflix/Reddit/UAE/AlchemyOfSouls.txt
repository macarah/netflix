Overall, I enjoyed the show but it was very much on the strength of the characters, the acting, and the chemistry. To me, the story felt like they were making it up as they went along with no real plan. Every time they needed something to happen, they created another Artifact of Convenience with a Ritual of Plot Device. Foreshadowing never happened and there was always a loophole. I cared about the relationships but by the end I was indifferent to the story outcome.
I had such a love/hate relationship with this show... Season 1 was a dream come true in the sense that it had fantasy, magic, action, romance and comedy - pretty much everything that I like in a story. All the characters were well-developed, the plot was engaging and the overall vibe was so surreal. I loved it. Felt like I was there going through the journey Jang Uk had. 

And then season 2 aired. Although I loved JSM as Mudeoki in season 1, I wasn't too distraught over the change of actress. But then I started season 2 and I felt my excitement and interest wane episode by episode. Almost every other scene made me wonder about its relevance to the story - the plot was murky and didn't hold up to the standard season 1 had set. I was expecting l would only have to adjust to a new actress but imagine my surprise at finding out that they had changed the character, the love story and the very thing I liked about the romance. 

Alot of people have talked about story, pacing and plot issues so I will just highlight the issues I found in the romance in s2:

- Amnesia: Adding this overused trope in a fantasy show that had previously established itself as a unique show, was such a disappointment. There are so many ways they could've shown the soul connection without having either of the characters go through memory loss. Ugh. This felt very fanfic level writing to me. 

- Jang Uk: I love this guy. He was such a fun character in s1 and to see him turn into a serious/darker version of himself was sad but also very much needed for the show. But why make him fall for Bu-Yeon so quickly? It just felt like insta-love to me. One of the best things about Jang Uk/Mudeoki in s1 was how they ended up having feelings for eachother because of going through trials and problems together. That's how their bond formed. To see all that erased in the new season, and them falling in love over proximity, marriage and shared kisses felt so fake and a disservice to their own story. It was a little unbelieving for me how Jang Uk was heartbroken for three years and it only took him a few days to fall in love again with another person. 

- Soul connection: Again, this felt like a cop-out from the writers. You can show soulmates in a story without it being so surface level.  I would have loved it if they had actually gotten to know eachother better, and then fallen in love. Anything that would be more believable because gosh I SO wanted to ship these two. 

Their visuals were so good but because of the reasons above, I just couldn't adjust to this storyline and hence, didn't see the chemistry everyone talked about. I honestly didn't even pay attention to their scenes after a certain point. I saw glimpses of s1 spark/spunk but I guess 10 episodes were just not enough to do justice to it. Which is why, they should have skipped the amnesia plot on the whole.... ugh. 

AOS1 was a solid 10/10 despite some minor issues but AOS2 was an easy 5/10 unfortunately.
This Kdrama divided me as much as it seems to have divided the audience: I was gleefully waiting for every episode of Part 1, but in my opinion, the finale of Part 1 started a sharp decrease in quality that Part 2 never recovered from. I think whatever else, this series is "very Hong Sisters": a fantastical story told with a juxtaposition of serious moments with ludacrous rom-com elements. I had a LOT of fun with Part 1 when this worked out really well: an image that stays in my mind is the moment when Mu Deok was training Jang Uk about how to run properly but ends up tripping and making a fool of herself because she doesn't have mastery of her new body in the same way that she did of her original - to me, this represents why Part 1 worked so well: we got to enjoy a mythical setting of mages and an old-style Asian setting mixed in with some funny comedy.

&nbsp;

But I can't help but think that Part 2 was an afterthought/extension of Part 1 due to its overwhelming popularity: the continuation seems so rushed to me. Mu Deok's death and Jang Uk's rebirth in the finale kind of felt like a reverse Deus-Ex-Machina to me -- like they ran out of conflicts to continue the story, so let's pull out a mind-control out of nowhere and a return-from-death just to emphasize our main character's godlike power...and then Part 2 kind of felt like they were stuck trying to evolve this corner they've written themselves into with no great avail: with Jang Uk basically unbeatable, how do you make interesting allies/enemies? And the answer seems like they couldn't: Naksu was hinted to be a badass all of Part 1 and she never returned to full form, instead just sort of becoming a sort of magical sidekick to Jang Uk in addition to the main love interest. Moreover, they seemed to try to write it so that Jang Uk fell in love with Bu Yeon for real....but at the same time, just kidding guys, actually she's full Naksu now, so actually they are back together! I think they did the best that they could due to the real life need of Jang So Min not returning...but I felt unsatisfied with the explanation that Bu Yeon is sort of an eternal hybrid of Naksu and real-Jin Bu Yeon. She kinda ended up having the romantic feelings of Naksu, but none of the power, while having all of the powers of Bu Yeon, but the physical characteristics of Naksu and none of the personality of Bu Yeon. It just didn't sit right with me.

&nbsp;

The villains seemed downright silly to me: I was thinking about how the assembly/Jin Mu basically died in a fire almost instantly and we got a showdown with a CGI bird that wasn't setup in Part 1...and I honestly did not care for it. I wish that they used Jin Mu as the "final boss" since that's what we seemed to have been developing towards this whole time.

&nbsp;

I guess in the end I feel like they could have used more time: I think I actually would have preferred it if they had somehow concluded Part 1 instead of continuing on with Part 2. The whole thing just gave me a feeling of being rushed rather than methodically planned.
In my opinion, the writers made a mistake by making Jang Uk so powerful in the second part. Once he had the ice stone and was unbeatable no matter how many the enemies where, they had no choice but making everyone on his side dumb, or else the show would end incredibly fast: in the first confrontation in ep 9 against all the shoul shifters, it took like a few minutes to kill them all and he could have killed Jin Mu too if the writers didn't need him for ep 10, then in ep 10 he dealt with all the mages from the assembly + Jin Mu very fast, then even the fire bird was nothing but a formality.

Because of this, a lot of the beginning of part 2 felt like filler. The strength of part 1, which was than most characters were quite intelligent, could not be replicated.
The first season was incredible. I was talking about it for ages. The second season left me a bit wanting. The amnesia plot the second time seemed rushed and there were so many plot holes. I understand the idea that they’re fated and they’ll fall in love regardless of who they think k they are, but their interactions together before she realized she was naksu and after were… not strong enough? It just didn’t feel right
My rating for this is 8.5/10.

What I'm about to say may apply to parts 1 and part 2 and will be edited later in case I'll see some grammar mistakes and add more.

**What I love about this series**

**The world and the characters**

 Daeho is a beautiful place and if the Hong Sisters would be creative enough and if they really want to, theres so much story they can do around the side characters and other places that were referenced in the series like the Seoho Fortress and Seo family.

The story arcs for the leads, especially Jang Uk(imo) is well done. His story has gone full circle. He's gone from being the weakest mage since his energy gates were closed to being someone who reached Hwansu and being Daeho's strongest man. And from >!meeting and falling in love with Cho Yeong to losing her to falling in love with her again and be married with her.!< Jang Uk and Cho Yeong are the perfect example of Soulmates.

Same goes for Cho Yeong. She lost everything and she ended with someone who loves her and will keep on taking her to the top of the tree at Dahnyanggok for eternity. And most importantly, she's now living as Yeong, something that was taken from her and she was never able to do.

It was great to see Park Jin >!stand beside Uk and support him on part 2 when he always tried to lock up Uk to "keep him safe" in part 1!<


**OSTs**

The soundtracks for this series are just heartbreakingly beautiful. But my standouts are Raindrops, Blue Flower and I'm Sorry.

The acting and chemistry are also one of this series' selling point. 


**What I dislike about this series**

Part 2 was too short and the amnesia plot took too long . Yes, yes, I have said this in the previous episode threads but this is like the biggest problem that I saw in part 2. The amnesia part took too much episodes. I think while they were trying to create parallels between part 1 and part 2, the Hong Sisters forgot that part 2 only had 10 episodes compared to part 1's 20. Jang Uk's progress was a bit slow for me and took him like 14 episodes to use Chisu but imo, it was acceptable as part 1 had 20 episodes and the side story was moving at the same time.

In part 2, it was the total opposite. The amnesia part used too many episodes while the plot is barely/did not even have progress. I think they chose to show more of the lead's romance/chemistry and forgot that they have a story to finish.

Imo, There were moments like the Amnesia plot could've ended early. 

 **On episode 3 where >!Yeong sees the memory from the Jade!<**
**Episode 4-5 where Jang Uk >!finally cries and accepts Mudeok's death. I feel like after Uk kissed Yeong they could wrote a way to end the amnesia way from there!<
**On episode 7, >!Seo Yul should've just come clean and told Uk everything**!<

Due the amnesia plot and short episodes, we barely see any development for the side character's story 3 yrs later. In times, it felt they were just **there for the sake of being there**. Heck, So-I got more to her character compared to Cho Yeon and Dang Gu. Their stare exchange on ep 1 literally went to nothing.

Seo Yul came back and ended up to be an emotional push for Uk.

Master Lee ended up more passive compared to ep 1. Remember when he brought >!Gwigu in the royal palace and scaring the shit out shaman Choi and Jin Mu that his soul almost came out of his body without doing AoS!<. In part 2, he was passive while giving information about Naksu that even him looked to be unsure of.


Overall, These are the thoughts that are currently on top of my head. Will try to add later.

Edit2: I wish that they had an episode where the cast finds out that >!JBY was Naksu. I hate how they handled it on the finale. Seo Yul saying that there were 7 of them in that room hinting about Naksu and 0 reaction from the others. Cho Yeon should've had a chance to know the truth.!<

Same goes with the Crown Prince , No acknowledgement or whatsoever that his insecurity took over him and caused the series a part 2. >!Heck, him saying that he "betrayed" Jin Mu because of the turtle was funny and all, but now that I think about it, I wished he had a more serious moment of realization, that what he did was wrong or may him saying he should've dealt with Jin Mu properly 3 years ago!<
A week has passed and I still can’t really put my thoughts into words. These past six months have been some of the most happy I’ve been in a while. I guess all I can really do is thank the cast, crew, writers, and audience for all their hard work. I’m so grateful to have watched it every week, and waited for every episode. I know I’ll eventually get over it, but it’s still really fresh in my mind. Farewell, 환혼! 🍃 Thank you for the memories ❤️
It's an imperfect show, to be sure, and I feel S1 was a lot stronger plotting and pacing wise than S2. Nevertheless, on the whole, it was a good watch, and I was greatly entertained - though I wish we could have had a little more focus on the other characters, but I realise that this is a show about Jang Uk and Cho Yeong.

Also the OSTs slayed us all, but I mean, you have Gummy and Ailee doing the OSTs, ofc they were gonna slay.
Thank you, Hong Sisters, for Season 1. The best compliment is a re-watch and I’ll definitely be revisiting this elaborate world with its compelling characters.  Not so for Season 2. All the richness was reduced to a single romance arc that was mind-numbingly repetitive. Even the fight scenes were lackluster. But the OST shined on.
overall, season 1 was way more cohesive, interesting and true to the characters than season 2. i don’t care if the season 2 pair had more chemistry, everything else was so underwhelming 😭
To me, this drama will stay as a big disappointment.

&#x200B;

I started the first part while it was still airing and ended up liking it enough to want the second part to air right away.

  
I thought that Jang Uk "power up" was too easy, but accepted it. I wasn't a fan of the fight scene either, but it was just detail for me.  
The dynamic of the trio of friends was nice, the Prince was a very good surprise and became one of my favorite characters. And Mudeok totally stole the show. Her inner struggle between getting revenge / getting her powers back and her "domestication" (I read this word and liked it. Gonna use it). She was getting friends and romantic feelings and she didn't know how to deal with it. I really loved their relationship, between lover, student and teacher, master and maid. Interesting dynamics.

&#x200B;

The second part kind of ruined everything for me.

The amnesia plot took way too much place. And when Naksu got her memory back, she just didn't do anything ? Didn't try to understand what happened to her, why she was under a spell and ended up killed Jang Uk ? Never went up against Jin Mu, the man behind her life of suffering ? To at least get some answers ?  
To me, if Bu Yeon had completley replaced Naksu, it would kind of been the same. I didn't recognize Mudeok.  
I never believed in the marriage between Jang Uk and Buyeon. Go Won and Choyeon were kinda cute but not as much as in the first part. The only real chemistry I ever felt was between the Prince and his turtle. The rest felt flat for me.  
Seo Yul was irritating. Not taking the medication, not talking, planing a murder suicide…  


The final was a mess. That might be controversial, but I think that Mother Jin, Kim Doju and Park Jin should have died.   
Suddenly all of the Unanimous Assembly is with the King and Jin Mu, and nobody was suspecting him of being behind the orignal swap of soul of the Queen (appart from the protagnist) ?  
The Fire Bird was nothing, we don't see the repercussions of the relics escaping…  There wasn't any weight. Everything end very well, everyone is happy… No loss for our heroes.  


At least it was pretty.
I was so confused for the longest time. Stuck through it but was not impressed.  I remembered why I usually don’t watch continuing seasons. Often they are underwhelming.
For those having AoS withdrawls, here are some great fics I've found:

If anyone has more recs, feel free to add!
I’d give this overall a 7.5/10.

The creativity of the plot and great leads is what carried this show. It was a brilliant idea, which at times they used very well.

The 1st part I found significantly stronger, but even that ran into my major issue by the end of part 1 and that was Jin Mu.

The show had dealt with the main villain before the end of part 1 but because of that had to stretch out the plot by character stupidity for over 10 episodes and it was a major oversight. They should have gotten someone else to be the antagonist for the end of part 1 and 2.

And in general the pacing was off for part 2, not without its good moments but nothing really was happening other than dragging out the inevitable reveal and conflict.

Either way this was a good show, but a missed opportunity to be an absolute classic.
Just prefacing as someone who stopped watching season 1 when it was announced mid stream that there was going to be a second season with a new female lead .
However do you think that it is feasible to watch season one as a standalone ?
I loved all the beauty , the clothes, the small interactions . Also it wasn't over....heavy in hard emotion so to speak. There were many light moments. Especially between Naksu and Jang, between maid Kim etc .
I originally started the show when it was airing but only got about half way through. The first few episodes were good, but the middle felt like it had too much filler. However, when I went back and watched the rest I was sooo impressed with the latter half of the show. The finale especially just blew me away. Absolutely amazing. I was sooo excited for the second season. 

But I have to say I was a bit disappointed…the second season started off strong, but fell into the same pattern that made me initially lose interest with the first season. The pacing was so slow and there was so much filler. Like a lot of others I was frustrated that it took so long for Naksu to be recognized…now, having seen the full show I understand why the writers waited until the end, but I still think it could have been handled better. I also felt like most of the actual plot didn’t really happen until the last few episodes, and then the pacing went from too slow to too fast and the resolution felt a little too easy imo. Of course, I was glad for the happy ending! As an aside, I also think the show would’ve benefitted from having a new villain with stronger motivations. 

Overall, it was an enjoyable show with some really great chemistry between the two leads (in both seasons). I wish the story itself had been a little tighter…but I loved getting to see a show that’s heavy on both fantasy and romance. I’d love to see more dramas in this style/genre!
I didn't even watch season 2 as I was disappointed at the end of season 1 and had an idea of  where they were going, but reading at this thread, I was right not to watch. My head canon ends right before everything falls apart at the end of season 1. lol 

Looks like it was a typical Hong sisters drama: exciting, fresh, funny, new, then drags...then drags..weird decisions are made/weird writing, then bad ending Lol I think they should bring another person to their team to help clean up their endings.
Liked the beggining of the show, it had potential; felt they were dragging it at the end of part one; the rest (part two) seemed like a patch to fix loose ends. 
Disliked the way they treated Mudeoki’s (real BuYeon) story line. To me it was a disappointment.
I just finished the drama in one week but I am so disappointed with part 2. The female lead actor change is so tragic. Jung Somin as Mudeok hanging on that bridge is what hooked me in the show. But I was still open minded with part 2 but what a great disappointment. No chemistry, bad acting, humor seems forced, script all over the place.

I don't see any chemistry between Jang Uk and Buyeon. Go Yoon Jung needs to practice her acting because it is really bad. Even Sol-i who is a bad character even made me root for her happy ending because she is such a great actor. But when Buyeon remembered that she is Naksu. The acting is not it.  Halfway through part 2, I was just fast-forwarding everything.

I would recommend season 1 with caution of a tragic ending. But I think part 2 is a waste of time. Binge watching a drama is also a bad decision especially if there is female actor change.
visual representation of the two parts. 1st is the horse's ass, the 2nd is the head. If it wasn't obvious

https://www.meme-arsenal.com/en/create/meme/1287009
I wished it wasn’t so rushed! If they were going to do a Part 2 & I know for xyz reasons they were limited on time, resources etc but really wished they were given more time to flesh out the scripts. In fact it’s a rare case where I think it would’ve benefited from more episodes because there were so many characters I loved and wanted more screen time for. Also there were so many great ideas, that I say felt like there was wasted potential (especially with the last few episodes and the pacing of it). That aside, what a journey it has been!! It’s a promising cast and can’t wait to see what they’re in next 👏
I can summarize my feelings as: great first half that (unexpectedly) went downhill real quick in part 2. Rushed AF, messy plot, and characters who just didn't feel the same. I've literally come to expect most kdramas to have anticlimactic finales (Reborn Rich is definitely the most recent obvious example to me).
Part one: 10/10 for me. Even though there were some flaws also here. Story was pushed along by the various motives of the various characters. Mudeok was fantastic, and the partnership with Jang Uk was fantastic. A bit of repeat in the growing of Jang Uk, but not too much. 

Part two: 3/10 and that is giving it mark on the high side. At first I hoped. Loved the depiction of grief. But then everything came to nothing, they kept going somewhere at night and when they arrived it was day – lots of illogical things like that. It was simply badly made in every way that matters. There was a little bit good dialogue in between, but in general the dialogue was too simple and a bit dull. There was one fight that was fun, otherwise it was just a repeat of previous fights. Nobody had any personal development that made them more interesting, quite the reverse. 

But the worst with part two was [the women](https://i.imgur.com/Q3u7hQi.png). One became more evil than ever, the few others became nothing, or so stupid and weak it would have been better to just omit them completely from the story and just make a story about males fighting, and then have some fertile women standing on a shelf that they could get as trophies when the fight was over. More honest. 

At least this extreme change between part one and part two made more people notice that women are not always shown in a realistic way on screen. Part one was absolutely not perfect if you wanted fifty fifty male and female characters, with equally interesting personalities, but Mudeok made up for all its flaws.


Maybe all the writers and the production team and everybody got covid, yet tried to muddle through. I hope that for the next project the writers will have proper time to develop the story and the characters and the meta subject, and I hope that also in Korea the second part got the same criticism as here in this sub, and that this will wake up some men who work with film. 

EDIT: I know that it is written by the Hong Sisters, that Sister depict females, and that Hong Sisters are female. However, the directors and probably producers are usually male. Possibly Hong Sisters has not had energy to go against them, or they couldn't be as involved as they hoped, or they didn't notice the lack of women because it is a lot of work to write even the outline of the story. The rest of this comment is about *film production in general*.

FINISHED EDIT.


Netflix last year had half male writers, half female, while in Korea is is 90% female writers. This is why female writers in Korea has been allowed to write fantasy and not just soap. I stopped reading Western fantasy stories because I got so fed up with the male view on everything. The female view of the world is why I watch Kdramas. Crossing fingers that the higher status these dramas are getting with the international streaming companies buying them will not force out the women in the industry. Very few men are able to write a believable or interesting female character, and even if they could, why can't we have female writers? Why can't women also do this kind of work?
AOS is one of my biggest KDrama regrets in a looooong while. It started so strong and full of potential only to end with tropey arcs, disappointing writing, so-so acting, and limited CGI/fight scenes (for a fantasy show!). This is the most unsatisfying happy ending I have watched. Felt like it was not earned. I really can't help but sigh every time AOS is mentioned. So much world building potential only to be wasted on teeny-bopper romance. Tsk.

Overall rating is 6.5/10. 

Except for some issues in pacing, Part 1 is a solid 9.5/10.
So.... I'm gonna just focus on the positives because I really did love this series a lot, despite all the flaws. It was a journey I will never forget!

**Top funny moments that made me laugh hard:**

* Mu Deok trying to escape the boat jump, hopping onto the bridge ledge, only to find out she can't pull herself up and falls into the lake (*S1 Ep2*).
* Mu Deok showing off her skills with the broom as Naksu and then falls during her speech because she used up too much energy with the moves (*S1 Ep3*).
* Mu Deok, Jang Uk, Kim Do Ju, and Dang Gu attempting to drink the filth water for attacking the Crown Prince, and everyone's on the verge of puking (*S1 Ep4*).
* Jang Uk, Crown Prince, and Seo Yul go to Jinyowon to find Mu Deok and get startled. Seo Yul acts calm but starts walking in the wrong direction because that's his coping mechanism (*S1 Ep7*).
* Jang Uk and Crown Prince using the jade stones to meet each other on the bridge and getting mad at each other for making one another's heart thump (*S1 Ep12*).
* Mu Deok thinking about what body to shift into after obtaining her powers back within the ice stone barrier and WE FINALLY get to see Jo Jae Yun's (Jin Mu) funny side (*S1 Ep18*). He is indubitably one of the funniest actors and I still love him even though he was the villain this series.
* Jang Uk choosing the design pattern on the ring for him and Mu Deok, but turns out all the patterns he picks were those of the rings for his past betrotheds (*S1 Ep20*).
* Seo Yul after eating Park Jin's deodeok: "this is deodeok? I couldn't tell... I truly appreciate your thoughtfulness but I cannot eat this anymore" (*S2 Ep1*).
* Honorable Mention: the English Dub for this show (S1). I rewatched some scenes in the dub and I was appalled.  I'm not even joking when I ask this- was it fan-made? Actually, with the lack of emotion, it didn't even sound like they were fans; it sounded like a group of highschoolers who were forced to dub this against their will for their end of the year project. I mean this in the most unpretentious way possible- I'm sorry if you chose to watch this in dub; you missed out on incredible acting.

**Top emotional moments:**

* Mu Deok attacking Jang Uk thinking Gil Ju soul-shifted into his body, but emotionally embraces him after Jang Uk says "I'm the only one who can look as you from this close- do you recognize me?" (*S1 Ep8*). This was the turning point of Naksu and the moment she realized how much she likes Jang Uk, and Jung So Min coveys it so well through her eyes.
* Mu Deok crying and slowly walking into the secret room after killing the soul-shifter, thinking Jang Uk is dead (*S1 Ep18*). Her movement and microexpressions were so good here.
* Cho Yeong's (Naksu) farewell / confession to Jang Uk knowing her soul is going to leave Bu Yeon's body soon so she doesn't want him to get any closer (*S2 Ep8*). Delivery was perfect by GYJ.
* Honorable Mention: Park Jin closing the door to Jinyowon and trapping in Kim Do Ju knowing she will die (*S2 Ep10*). Incredible acting by Yoo Jun Sung (although Kim DoJu's "death" still rubs me the wrong way because it was so forced to embody the conversation they had, like she could've literally left to save some tears from everyone).

**Baeksang Best Performance in a Scene goes to:**

The "Queen's" (Shaman Choi's) monologue in Season 1 Episode 19. Kang Kyung Hun truly displayed her acting prowess in this whole scene, an absolute masterclass in acting; I was beyond speechless while watching that scene. The way she portrayed that insane character, that creepy smile, the facial expressions & microexpressions during the entire monologue, the tears, the screams, the laugh after her brother stabs himself, all just phenomenal. Not even exaggerating when I say it was one of the best acted scenes i've ever scene.

Also special shoutout to the OST of this series which was perfect. It's rare for me to love ALL the songs of the OST but I really loved every single track. I especially can't stop listening to Kassy - Aching, Lia (ITZY) - Blue Flower, and Just Watching You 2 - Minhyun.

Thank you Hong Sisters for a great show that i'll never forget :')

Please comment and share your favorite funny / emotional moments!
I still haven’t finished the final episode of season 2. I loved the first season and the entire the cast. I wish the writing had been faster for the second season but overall I still found it enjoyable at the start. The last few episodes were frustrating me so I tapped out. I hope I’m able to find something similar to this show again.
This drama has given me one of the worst post-drama withdrawal symptoms ever, it has been 2 weeks and I still could not move on. I have watched at least 1 scene of AoS everyday and am listening to the OSTs on replay. I have rewatched it 3 times and noticed that I had missed quite a few details. The lovestagram between Go Youn Jung and Lee Jae Wook is too swoon-worthy that Saturday and Sundays had become mundane without AoS.

To start off, this drama had a brilliant premise, with some of the most interesting world-building of daeho. I kind of wished that the lore of this world can be expanded. There are so many places that are just mentioned but never visited. To name a few: North Fortress, Seoho Fortress, Wol Fotress. It is said that Daeho is a country, so is Daeho the entire world or there's more? Since the King did mention protecting the north, I would assume Daeho is only part of a continent - this could have been explored further. There are also many more mythical beings other than the fire bird and the turtle.

OST wise - hands down no contest. I had listened to every one of the background music by various artists on both albums, and I got to say they are seriously fitting of the setting used in the drama. For example, Imperial Star, when Jang Uk's King's star was in the sky, and "Forbidden Spell" when he was about to fight the Fire Bird. The background music utilized really increases the suspense and thrill of the drama. "Light and Shadow" is my favourite amongst all the instrumental OSTs, truly befitting of Jang Uk and Cho Yeong, and a perfect utilization in the wedding scene. Let's not forget the brilliant OSTs - to name a few - Aching, Blue Flower, I'm Sorry, These 3 really robbed my heart with their beautiful lyrics and tune. As someone who is learning Korean on the side, rewatching the show without english subtitles, it made me realize how perfect the placement of the OSTs were to the setting of the scenes. For example the part where Jang Uk kisses Yeong's eyes realizing who she was, the scene was accompanied by Lia's Blue Flower, where the final chorus literally says "I missed you a lot, Looking at the blue flowers that bloom again in your eyes". The netflix subtitles would not translate the song's lyrics real-time, so I think this kind of robs some of the viewer's experience of how meaningful the song placement is. Nonetheless, it's still brilliant.

Acting - Boy oh boy was the cast's performance stella. Never once was I unimpressed by the acting of everyone. The comical scenes were funny, the sad scenes felt like a blade through my heart (pun intended). Both Go Youn Jung and Jung So Min performed Naksu's character really well. When rewatched, I really came to realize what both actresses' portrayal was - Mu Deok was prickly, the side of Naksu that was closed in, while Bu Yeon was the side of Naksu that could have been pure and could love with all her heart. Lee Jae Wook's character on both parts felt really different too, part 1 he was a happy-go-lucky man, while part 2 he was burdened. He did a really good job portraying Jang Uk. Let's not forget the microexpressions of all the leads, they did really good jobs portraying various emotions. Shout out to Jin Mu, the actor behind him Jo Jae-Yun, who is actually a really sweet person IRL, but it did well portraying a villain. Anyways, I absolutely loved the kiss scenes in Light and Shadow, wayyyyyy more than that of Part 1. GYJ and LJW's chemistry were on serious fire, really do be suspecting that they are more than friends.

Plot - I think many others have already mentioned it, many prefer part 1 to part 2 because of how draggy part 2 was. I can agree with this but after rewatching the show, I kind of understood what the Hong Sisters were planning when they wrote this show. They wanted to showcase the tragic love between the leads. However, still, I would have preferred if it wasn't the whole season worth. Many may be disappointed we didn't get to see a badass Naksu again, but I loved that she is not longer the power-hungry, selfish, misogynistic, didn't trust anyone, cared only about revenge and wouldn't hesitate to kill anyone as long as it suited her. Yeong herself admitted she hated this version of herself and regretted it her past life. I loved that she leaves behind her violent past, and chose love.

Overall rating: I LOVE IT / 10

Would watch again in the future when my Korean gets better to get a better experience. Some translations weren't too accurate in convening the meaning behind the script. I know that the show is over and every one of the actors have moved onto their new projects, but a tiny part of me hope that there would be a spin-off on anything, be it finding the relics or something else. I just want AoS content. Also, the cast's friendship is really cute, GYJ, SSH, YIS and SHW visited LJW's fanmeeting - with LJW saying "I knew the moment I saw you you are my wife" with GYJ present LOL.
By Season.

I give season 1 a 9/10. Mu Deok and Uk's chemisty was off the charts. Mu Deok relationship with other characteres also shined, particularly with the crown prince. Always brought me a easy laugh when they had a scene. So really I would Mu Deok actress kinda carried but that would be doing a disservice to other characters and actors. They did great but remove mu deok and her actress, not as great..

Which brings me to season 2 which they did indeed remove Mu Deok and her actress and the qaulity and chemistry between the leads DIPPED heavily. I give season 2 a 6/10. I really don't like what they did with Naksu/Mudeok.. Different actress, different character..  Which is what they were going for, but at same time.. The character didn't have chemisty with UK like Mu deok.. She had WAY better chemisty with secondary romance/interest leads then primary which is UK..  spent much of season having Jang Uk be straight up savage to new Naksu and it wasn't pleasant to watch. 

Season 1 - 9/10

Season 2- 6/10

Overall - 8/10.  

Season 2 suffered due mostly to the FL swap.. The new Lead did good but it was obvious she didn't have the IT factor like season 1 lead.. But KUDOS to studio for doing what's best for their story I guess..
So I've been watching more c dramas lately and I've gotta say man, the Hong sisters lifted A LOT from wuxias. The trope of the servant who was once powerful or will be powerful later who follows her master around (**LBFAD**), the body/face switch (**Love of Thousand Years**, **The Untamed** if they followed the original novel), seond chance romance for characters who get resurrected, the different families and clans reminded me of sects and each powerful sect taking in disciples, the crown prince and the royal family as contrasted with the wuxia/mage world (different dynamics play out in both and the imperial family don't really get into the janghu world business and vice versa unless one will majorly affect the other), the outfits and world that isn't really grounded in any reality (this is obvious), the training sequences and the characters powering up and these powers/skills have names, the amnesia plot that isn't navigated very well (think LBFAD but tbf it's a common k drama trope), the artifacts and animals that are sources of power (someone mentioned the black tortoise and the firebird in the weekly threads also being found in wuxias). I think those are the similarities I can think of for now. I'm surprised the chinese audience didn't make cultural appropriation claims (with the way that controversy killed **Joseon Exorcist** very quickly) but I suppose it's different when the stories are based on pure fantasy. I still think it was a good attempt which maybe another korean screenwriter/director will polish in terms of storytelling. Certainly I thought the cinematography, acting, costume and art direction was top notch
It was a mistake to do a second season.

The story should have had a happy ending at the end of season 1 with Mudeoki instead of that gut punch we saw.

The problems with season 2 are too many. From the top of my head:
- The ML was too OP, with no enemy at the same or higher level or power;
- Amnesia is a overused lame trope;
- Even with a good show by the actress that played the FL, it was a new personality, almost another personage and it was not as fun as mudeoki;
- The comedy side of the show was almost absent in season 2.
Goodbye AOS. And the stardome to lee jae wook and go yoon jung. So min been already the star before. Loved the drama, the wait of every week and the second season season, worth it. Story and action wise s1 > s2 and felt like its just a stretch for not unable to complete in s1. Could have been few episodes more and be done with but i am not complaining tho.  

Like someone mention s2 has many loopholes and introducing many new plot and sub plot to fill and continue the story and the writer seem lost. 

Wanted more action scene like in s2. They had a chance but they couldn't deliver and wasted. Overall i love it. No lack of actings from the actors' side. It was well made. The cinematography, the music and OSTs all loving it. Goodbye aos, glad to be part of it here.
Okay, so correct me if this is the wrong place to post this, but I believe I am in the right place. If you haven't finished watching this, or are planning to watch it, I am warning you that there will be spoilers below.

Okay, so I just finished watching the nineteenth episode of Alchemy of Souls. Maybe it is silly posting this, considering I only have one more episode to watch, but since there is a second season that is important to the plot line, I wanted my questions answered, even if it involves spoiling the show. I already know a lot of what is going to happen, as it is hard avoiding spoilers after a drama has been released, so I don't really mind anyway. 

So my question is this:

* Is it just simply going to be overlooked that Naksu/Mudeok literally killed people, or at least did nothing to save people? 

Like I said, I just watched the 18th/19th episode, and the part >!where the soul shifter (Master Kang) sucks the life out of the two mages absolutely horrified me, because after, it is shown that Mudeok was there the whole time. And not only that, she also currently possessed Naksu's powers again. Those two mages didn't have to die, and while they were shown as arrogant, perhaps even bullies, that doesn't justify their deaths (especially as it was mainly to save Yul). And Jang Uk knows she did nothing, and that she was also ready to sacrifice literally everyone, including him and Yul!<

I get she had this horrible upbringing and was raised as an assassin, and >!saw her father get killed!< , but that doesn't justify her actions. So, is this going to be overlooked, or is this something that gets answered/solved in the next series?

Other question:

* Is the whole sorcery thing going to get resolved?

They talk about sorcery being unnatural and evil. It is basically likened to being a dark magic, and yet no one seems to worry about using it too much, and even our supposed heroes play around with it. Is it just about how greedy the human nature is? Or are none of our main characters supposed to be good moral characters? 

Like being in love and saving people doesn't really justify playing with sorcery. You shouldn't use evil means to bring about good. I have seen some people discussing this from early episodes when Alchemy of Souls was first released, but I haven't seen anymore final details on it. 

So, is all this resolved, or is it just that my beliefs are too different from what is being portrayed?

>!Like Jang Gang dies as punishment for using this sorcery, but Mudeok and Jang Uk seem to have no qualms about getting involved, so the idea of how it is being portrayed seems kind of conflicted. The Leader of Songrim is also completely against it, and he seems like the most reasonable character in the show, although he did try to cover for Jang Gang. Though I am kind of relying on the reason our main characters are playing around with it, being the fact that Jang Uk is still just an immature lad blinded by love!<

I am not going to lie, I absolutely love this drama and it is one of the first in a long time that I am completely enraptured by. The acting is on point, the characters funny, relateable and loveable, and a love story that is unique and yet so touching. I just can't get comfortable with these two points.
Even though I loved finally having a fantasy romance k-drama I ended up giving season/part two 7/10. I felt a bit underwhelmed with the fighting scenes too often — they were always cut so short because no one was more powerful than Uk or their motives didn’t give them a reckless edge in a sense. The amnesia trope was just carried out too long for the viewer and the last two episodes gave me whiplash from the death scenes 😭 still highly recommend for a good time and eye candy. The fits and earrings on the men in the first season were absolutely stunning! Makeup on the women consistent and beautiful. And the nails! So beautiful 😍 I’m hoping this drama boosts LJW to A-list status. He really blew this role out of the park with his natural charms and charisma !
Just happy that it’s a happy ending. Loved the journey despite the many painful parts. Jang Uk and the 2 female leads were BOMB AF
There are definitely things i didn’t like. But it became one of those things that the good parts, i liked so much that, i don’t much care about the blemishes.
i have written many lengthy comments about this drama over the past few weeks (including [an analysis of how one aspect of the finale ties into the wider message of part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/106cot7/alchemy_of_souls_light_and_shadow_episode_10/j3hxchr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)) but wanted to share my perception of AoS: light and shadow as a whole. 

unlike other fantasy tv shows i have watched (kdrama or otherwise), the world of daeho feels fully realised, and seemed so from the very start of part 1. there is a breadth of lore that is woven through each episode, establishing the history of this land and its inhabitants, the rules of its magic system, and the social/political structures that influence character behaviour. it’s world building at its finest (imo), and the characters that inhabit this fictional world are as living and breathing as they get. 

one of the most special elements of this drama is the interactions between these characters, each of whom are acted so convincingly and so layered in their personality and motivations that they become known to the audience. watching AoS feels like being dropped into this magical world (knowing all the while that the stay will only be a short one) and becoming witness to a particular moment in the lives of its inhabitants. they are characters that will continue living following the end of the final episode, and it’s because of this feeling that i do not mind the somewhat meandering plot of part 2; in fact, i think it complements the type of story that is being told. *if* AOS is pitched as a coming of age narrative following a group of young magic users as they navigate their relationships and choose the destination they’re heading towards, then, arguably, a focus on character interaction rather than a grand, action driven narrative makes a lot of sense. 

but that’s not to say that part 2 of this drama doesn’t deal with heavy and meaningful subjects. despite the lighthearted and humours elements (which remain some of my favourite and most memorable), a key theme in this second part is grief. following the end of part 1, both jang uk and seo yul are on a path towards self destruction. on learning of her true identity, cho yeong is compelled to isolate herself, perceiving her erasure as penance for her sins. it’s saddening and hard hitting subject matter to cover. ultimately, the drama’s ending conveys a message of hope: the central characters learn of their power to choose their own destiny, and with that open up the possibility of both self forgiveness and triumph over evil. they come to recognise the strength in embracing one’s shadows and accepting the past. 

jang uk’s counterpart, the shadow to his light and the light to his shadow, is cho yeong, known to deaho as naksu, referred to by her lover as mudeok, mislead into believing she is in fact jin buyeon. she is a woman with different faces and a multitude of identities, and part 2 is, for her, a journey in discovering who she truly is; of finding a room to call her own. 

something i’ve been thinking a lot about is naksu’s apparent relegation to the status of “damsel in distress”. before sharing my thoughts on this, i will say that i love a badass, sword wielding, magic using female character. i love watching them on screen and i love the feeling of empowerment that doing so gives me. however, i am of the opinion that such a character is only *one* type of “strong female character” (and take issue with the assumption that female characters have to be strong, physically or emotionally, in order to be worthy of admiration). 

in part two of AoS naksu is not the shadow assassin we first encountered. how can she be? that life, one she was moulded into by jin mu, was fuelled by grief, anger, and a misdirected desire for revenge. in part 2, the woman who once lived as naksu now lives as jin buyeon, a jinyowon priestess. while uk is associated with the image of the sword, naksu is now associated with the rose petal. strikingly beautiful, open with her affection, and the inhabitant of a body that won’t allow her to pull herself from boat to bridge (though she will always try), she is (on the surface) very different to the previous versions of herself. but all the key elements of her personality, those which make her cho yeong, remain. we see time and time again how determined she is be free (regardless of the pain she has to endure), to protect those she loves (even if this puts her in harm’s way) and to share her thoughts and opinions with others (no matter how unconventional or surprising they might be). “it is better to die than to do nothing,” and she will always do something to ensure the safety of those she cares about. part 2 is, in part, a story of people unjustly telling our female lead no (“no, you shall not leave jinyowon,” “no, you shall not help with saving seo yul”) and her *doing the thing* anyway. for all these reasons, she remains a character i love to watch on screen. 

i really really enjoyed watching part 2. it will remain (along with part 1) in my top 5 kdramas for a long time to come, perhaps forever. it’s a beautiful kdrama, in so many ways; the costumes and the setting, the motifs (tree and bird, light and shadow), the at times poetic and philosophical script, the layered relationships, the final episode. i will be forever grateful that the writers respected the >!value of the happy ending.!<
Never was able to bring this up in the discussion. But I remember when they were trying to kill the blood parasite in Yul  and Bu-Yeon’s sister was supposed to carry the orb in her mouth but couldn’t because she and Dan Gu did the deed and could have been pregnant. It’s funny cause probably did  and they had twins in the epilogue that  😭😭
I have some questions about AoS season 1 (I'm currently watching season 1 because I saw some snippets of season 2 and I want to watch S2)

What I don't understand is, Naksu is supposed to be very powerful and a highly skilled assassin, but it's only ever talked about off-screen or shown in flashbacks. She's very weak >!due to her current body!< , which I get, but I'm 13 episodes in and she doesn't seem to be getting stronger or gaining her powers back. It seems like, apart from her first duel, only the dudes get to do the cool sword fights.

* Do we ever get to see Naksu/Mudeok be a badass?
* Also, can someone please explain the different mage power levels?
* Does the same actress who plays Naksu in the flashbacks also play her as Mudeok in Season 2? 
   * If so, are we meant to pretend that she's been Mudeok this whole time >!or does she shift bodies again!< ?

Thanks
Just finished watching part 2 and I have to say AOS has been one of the most entertaining kdramas I've watched. And I agree with everyone saying Part 1 was definitely much better although I didn't really mind the actress change. In fact I felt somehow Lee Jae wook had  better chemistry with Go Yoong Jung. There scenes together were always heart fluttering. But despite that Part 2 felt very lacking. I think part of that could be the short number of episodes. I wish there were atleast 12 episodes maybe because by the end everything felt so much rushed that I didn't get the chance to feel much even during the most important scenes.  The most awaited scene of >! Jang Uk FINALLY recognising Naksu !< was so...anticlimatic? I was like..that's it?  This season was definitely more focused on their romance which although was pleasing to watch, was also just not enough.. We barely spent any time with the secondary characters and their story this time which was one of the major strength of part 1. Part 1 didn't only focus on the main leads but other characters also got to equally shine. Also I wish there was a different villain this season than Jin mu. Like I was just sick of seeing him on screen spouting same non sense and scheming same old plans. Maybe >! him soul shifting should have happened earlier on so that we could have had atleast a fresh face as a villain. !< 

Part 2 was overall disappointing because it had so much potential. The ending saved it tbh and I'm at least glad that it was nicely wrapped. Nonetheless, AOS is still one of the best fantasy dramas I've seen (with some of the best action scenes and CG!!! ). I absolutely fell in love with it's lore and I hope there is a continuation to the story.
So I just started season 2 (I'm at EP2) and I'm really annoyed with the Naksu appearance. In season 1, when Naksu switched bodies, her original form was retrieved by Songrim and Park Jin, Seo Yul, Heo Yeom and Sang-Ho all saw her body from up close. Even Dang-Gu was there when her body was being burned, and also Park Jin said that many people saw her body at that moment, so I don't understand why nobody recognizes her in season 2 except Jin Mu. Jang-Uk arrived only after her body was burned, so I understand he never knew what Naksu looked like, but Seo Yul?? Should have recognized her immediately. Is there something I'm missing lol?
I couldn’t enjoy part 2 because it felt like Jang Uk is cheating on Mu Deok. Although it was Naksu who he loves but I guess I felt too attached the previous FL lol. And I don’t like how they kept showing bu Yeon is the rare beauty with that flipping hair and slow mo =.=
I'm glad it had a good wrap up and now that there both on my netflix, I'll go bing it when I'm done watching other drama's😌

🌺💙
It's a flawed drama, but given it is a fantasy with its own world and rules, it was still a great and refreshing watch; a 9.3/10, definitely one on top of my list. The amazing cast, their chemistry, the behind the scene outtakes, the OSTs, our discussions, and the promotions definitely made my AOS experience the best. 

That ending still replays in my dreams, I am beyond satisfied.
Little late on this ain't y'all? 

Anyhow, can someone recommend me other historical/edo/fantasy shows like this?
I’ll keep it brief since there’s so much discussion already. I seem to be a bit opposite to the majority where I LOVED part 2 way more than part 1. 

Part 1 felt too slow, with lots of filler scenes and the romance to me felt forced - I just didn’t feel the chemistry. Part 2 on the other hand with the actress switch was both super interesting made me feel the chemistry way more! 

The story pace was better as well and kept me more engaged (although maybe too fast?). I wish they would’ve just distributed the episodes a bit more evenly between 1 and 2. 

Also the show seemed to start being about the FL and in the end she took a back seat which was a bit disappointing. 

Overall though, season 2 made me love it and I’m glad I stuck with it. The cast was amazing and I’ll miss it a lot. Overall 8/10
I enjoyed watching the drama it has become one of my favorites. The chemistry with both lead actresses was 🔥 I hope there is a season 3.
I loved the contrast we saw between the Jang uk who was yearning for power and the Jang Uk who got this power. His initial dream was all about becoming a powerful mage and following in his father's footsteps, whereas later, he realised the only thing he craved was peace and happiness for his loved ones. 

The show also focused on how people are scared of Jang uk's potential even when it was locked away and how they tried to use him, after he had the ice stone. Most viewers don't understand or relate to him but from what I have seen, the world does not like to encourage skilled or talented people for fear of what they might become. In spite of all the opposition, Jang Uk had to put himself in difficult situations with little help, just to tap into his potential. The show demonstrated the experiences of people who stand out, really well. 

I feel like part 1 was naksu's shadow and part 2 was her light. In part 2 she did not inhibit or force herself to become something that others wanted (like how she became naksu, for the villain, in part 1) and we saw her brave and carefree side. It felt like she was finally free.

The show was enjoyable to me, not only for the visuals, but also for the unique take on the story, focusing more on delivering deeper aspects rather than trying to satisfy the audience or being predictable.

I will give this show a 9.5/10 because it did feel a tiny bit disconnected at certain parts.
**Part 1**

**Likes:** 
- Jang Uk’s character: I loved his tenacity while mastering his power. His was witty and I liked how he really cared about Mudeok. 
- All the characters (except Jin Mu & So-I): Hong Sister’s did a good job creating many interesting characters! If there’s anything I miss the most from this drama, it’s them!!Everyone had something unique to them and all the relationships that formed between the different pairs were great 😊 
- The OSTs: wonderful & memorable 🥹 Scars leave a beautiful trace, just watching you, and aching were my favorites ❤️
- The world-building & the fantasy: For the most part I feel like it was in tact. I also love fantasy so I enjoyed watching the fantasy world! 

**Meh/Dislikes:**
- The show got too repetitive. Yes, I enjoyed watching Jang Uk’ growth like I mentioned, but when Jang Gang has been out the picture for like 18 episodes and so many plots were opened like Naksu not receiving her powers yet, so many people somehow don’t know she’s a soul shifter, Jin Mu’s schemes, etc. I just got to the point where I wanted to see something different. With the ending of the whole show, obviously I know >!Naksu never uses her own powers in public!<, Jin Mu’s schemes had to last for P2 🤦🏿‍♀️, >!Jang Gang got 2 minutes of present time!<, etc. But in the moment of watching I really did want to see some other plots get more attention.
- Jin Mu: One thing I dislike STRONGLY is a villan with too much plot armor and that’s Gwangu Jin Mu. There’s no way people still decided to listen to him at the end of Part 1 but then there were bells, whyyy 😖 his never-ending schemes regardless of all the smart and strong characters around him was a little annoying to watch and waned my attention.
- The length: 20 episodes that are all around 80 minutes is hard for me to focus on so unless I’m hooked on the show, my attention span is gonna fluctuate and that’s what happened here. There wasn’t enough happening for me to stay excited. 
- Jang Uk’s and Mudeok’s romantic chemistry: I didn’t feel the romance between them. As pupil and master they were great, but romance-wise I was really only feeling it from Jang Uk. I know that she was being careful because she was scared of running wild, and she was also his master. In real life she’s his sunbae which also might’ve translated into the show but overall I didn’t feel strongly for them.

**Overall**: P1 got too repetitive to me but I loved all the characters. There were weeks where I was really excited but other weeks that were meh and I struggled to finish the eps. The last ep had me really excited for P2 though! P1 was a 7.5/10 for me! I didn’t hate the drama but I can’t say I *liked* it. Could be an 8/10 though with more thought 🤔

**Part 2**

Likes:
- Chemistry between Jang Uk & Cho Yeong ❤️‍🔥: They were great!!! All their kisses and their interactions (conversations, arguments) had heat to it and I loved it 😍 I was disappointed with their meeting at the end though when they found out she was >!Naksu!<. It didn’t carry half the intensity of their prior exchanges but oh well 😭
- Majority of the characters once again!!!: I really liked Park Jin and Maidservant Kim and happy they got to move forward 🥰 I was happy to see Dang Gu and Cho Yeon get back together! I liked Jang Uk and the Crown Prince’s relationship although I kinda missed all the scenes between them from P1. Overall the characters were the best part of the **entire**🫶🏾
- The last episode: everything happened quickly but it also felt like a good pace. I’m happy that all of them were happy and in their respective places 😊 it was a good wrap up for all of their individual stories. I need to rewatch it because I was under the impression I was going to be disappointed with the ending so I watched with a rather disappointed mindset 😭 now I can watch it with a happy mindset 😂

**Meh/Dislikes:**
- Jin Mu: Way too much plot armor. At the end I couldn’t believe they were still dragging him out with the >!soul switching between him and Yul’s uncle!< 😭 it makes sense since he was the ring leader of it all but I was thinking “damn, when is this gonna end?!” 😭

- The King: Absolutely useless 😀 he didn’t do much in the 1st season either but then he had the audacity to be bad, dumb, and useless in P2. Recipe for disaster. 

- The Queen: After all she’s been through she still decided to go after a young body and be a supporter of soul switching 🤦🏿‍♀️ she met the ending she deserved. And to make things worse, the King sold her out to get an ice stone, they were made for each other 😂

- So-I: Her end was sad but I still don’t feel much empathy for her. She was doing what she needed to do to survive but she caused a lot of trouble Part 1 and helped kill our girl Mudeok so it’s a no for me still 🫣

- Amnesia: took up way too much time but when I look back I don’t even know what they would’ve done if it had ended earlier. The only plot of this part was Cho Yeong finding out who she was and the fire bird, correct?? 🥴 I don’t know but I would’ve liked to see her know who she was earlier on. It was definitely starting to drag. 

- Master Lee 😑: I don’t know how someone who was literally the catalyst of everything season 1 could be so passive and horribly unclear season 2. Everytime he opened his mouth it was something different from before. I so badly wanted him to stop talking in riddles because he was saying a whole bunch of nothing!!!! 😤

**- The writing:** I honestly enjoyed P2 better but it was probably because of the lead’s chemistry and the characters. The writing wasn’t as solid as P1 when it came to the world-building. It seemed like things were always changing. And I wasn’t the biggest fan of the fire bird inclusion but then again what would P2 have been without it 🤷🏿‍♀️

**Overall P2**: I still loved our characters!! I liked the darker Jang Uk and Cho Yeong! The actress did a phenomenal job and deserves her flowers 💐 I just think that P2 lacked the rather solid world-building of P1. I mean obviously I was a fan of the chemistry so the 2nd part focusing on the romance was fine by me but if Jin Mu is still gonna be an issue I need more than just some weak schemes. This part was an 8/10 for me but maybe an 8.5/10 upon rewatching the last ep! 

This was my 3rd/4th Hong’s sisters show and I can see what people were talking about with their writing lol. I think AOS was a really ambitious show though and I can understand why people love it! I’ve been able to move on comfortably from the show but I will remember all the amazing characters ❤️ I also can’t wait to watch many of them in the future, amazing acting!!! 🤗
Really enjoyed this drama more than I thought I would and saw myself participating in discussions on Reddit or twitter which I usually don’t do unless it’s a drama I am really into. Would probably give it a 8 or 8.5. 

Enjoyed Part 2 more than 1 tbh which may be different from the majority and truly felt like the main leads had more chemistry than the previous main lead (This may be controversial as well, think Jung So-Min did a fantastic job as well but really loved Go-Young in this role more.) which we saw on screen, promo for the show, and even interactions on set. My main issue with the show would probably be the pacing where it felt like they did not accomplish anything for like a couple of weeks and felt like the story was not progressing at all. Also the final battle between the good guys and bad guys were super anti-climactic with the good guys winning without barely any opposition or struggle. 

The happy ending is what probably made me enjoy the story after completing it and helped me overlook those issues with the characters I’ve grown a connection and also sympathy for all the bs they deal with to be happy at the end.
i’m surprised to see so many people rating part two so lowly. i will admit that i watched just for the romance/actors so maybe i’m biased in not caring too much about the plot. that being said, i’m still confused about some parts and wondered if anyone could clarify some things for me.

1. Did they ever explain how Naksu’s body came back after they supposedly burned her? i understand her soul being in Buyeon’s body but why did it look like Naksu?

2. Will Jang Uk stay with the ice stone for the rest of his life? What will happen when he dies? 

Thanks in advance for any replies! Either way, i loved this show so much, even though many plotlines could have been done better. The characters were likable and the romance 10/10.

Really hope they also continue this with world there are a lot of stories they can make with the world the Hong Sisters have created
I just finished part 1, I refuse to believe part 1 ending 20 exists. And from what Im seeing here part 2 sucks im not going to watch it.

This was a clear case of forcing the writers to make up shit so you can cash in more money.
I have no plans watching Part 2 because the very reason I watched this drama is because of Jung So-Min. I can't find myself rooting for the new FL so does anyone have a list of the important events that happened? Like the answers to questions left? Or even a summary of Part 2. I was just so invested on the first FL and ML, it just feels like Uk is cheating on Mu-doek in Part 2. They literally saw each other at their lowest and fought (learned) together to achieve the best versions of themselves/discovering themselves. How can I believe that Uk would fall in love with another woman with that fact in mind?! Who can get over such great love (and the trauma of her dying?!) 

But at the same time, i wanted to know how they wrapped up this drama so please please spoil me of part 2!!
Switing the FL for part 2 made so much sense I loved the first lead but the having her as the lead for the second one would not have made sense seeing as the second lead was the original naksu to begin with. Both seasons are good if you want to watch it, please do. Both seasons are good different tones but still enjoyable
It's been several months and I'm still thinking about this show. Just joined r/KDRAMA and wanted to add my opinions about AOS!

I honestly loved S1 so much but felt like S2 was a little messy and rushed. The firebird issue seemed like an unnecessary problem to add on to the other problems that already had to be solved. I expected season 2 to focus more on figuring out how to stop Jin Mu and help Buyeon/Cho-Yeong regain her powers, deal with the ice stone issue, as well as save Seo Yul. Those aspects alone would've been enough in season 2.

Also, there were quite a few loopholes that still confuse me. Why was Jang Uk considered the King's son but if Cho-Yeong had a child it would be considered Buyeon's because of the body she was in? I feel like the soul switching and parent thing didn't make much sense.

I know Cho-Yeong didn't want to use her powers again because she stopped identifying as the "evil" Naksu, but imagine how badass it would've been if she took revenge on Jin Mu as Naksu, the person he himself created.

Anyways, I absolutely loved this show and I can go on and on about it forever, but there were some aspects I wish were worked on a little better. Looking forward to watching more Kdramas with the amazing cast members of AOS!
Can someone explain why Jin U Tak  doesn't like his eldest daughter, Jin Bu Yeon? I'm confused about the explanation in the show it seems that he was lied to by Jin Mu and he thought that she was Jang Gang's daughter but then he says that Jin Bu Yeon allowed him to get married to Jin Ho Gyeong. However he was already married to Jin Ho Gyeong??
I've done a rewatch and I have to disagree. There's a lot of set-up and echoing of themes and motifs throughout the show. I think they always knew where the story was going, but the writing was rushed for the second part, which meant the beats didn't always land quite right. The Sol-Ren storyline, in particular, is carefully worked through.  


The one character whose storyline I think was altered was Young Lady Heo. I think she was meant to be more of a nice secondary love interest who ends up with Seo, but they gave her a little more to do and made her more unlikeable. Though I also think that Seo is intended to be his generation's version of Park-Jin--great at magic and managing, but slow on the uptake in his emotional life, while Young Lady Heo is a bit like Maid Servant Kim. Both pining after their lost loves and not seeing the possible connection with one another until later.
I disagree. >!Naksu opening Jinyowon by accident already hinted that the body shes in is Buyeon/Seol Ran's. Cho Yeon mentioning that powerful Jinyowon priestesses can trap souls in their body which is what JSR did to Naksu's soul.!<
Watching s1 was very easy. Loved the FL. 2nd season was a chore.  If you want me to accept the ML/FL romance from s1 continuing to s2, at least make her personality like 20% similar. She acted like a completely different person. if it was just bc of the amnesia, idk. either get rid of the amnesia plot somehow or just have her still act like her even without her memories.
Could not agree more. 



I just do not get why the writer differently portrayed Naksu's character in S1 and S2. 


I was still okay-ish with the amnesia trope, but why making her dumb? 


Losing one's memories should not equal to becoming dumb.
Wow…exactly my thoughts! 🙌🏼

Absolutely love S1 because of the excellent combi of magical fantasy (very Harry Potter to me) and comedy. The action scenes were great too!

The change in the lead actress didn’t affect me as much as I thought it would - GYJ did a great job. But absolutely agree that the change in Naksu’s character in S2 totally surprised me and I didn’t like the character portrayed at all. I find the difference very jarring. Despite the amnesia, a person’s underlying character shouldn’t change that much. Really hate the part where she was ‘exploiting’ her good looks and was also willing to marry a man only for his looks (when she thought she was gg to marry Seo Yul).

but I must say the dark broody Jang Uk is 🔥
> But why make him fall for Bu-Yeon so quickly? It just felt like insta-love to me. 

That's because you are not looking at it right.  They fell in love because they recognized each other.  Bu-Yeon said this at the end.  I knew you were my husband the minute I met you.  Present tense.  She recognized him. Except that it was at a subconscious level. 

Bu-Yeon started remembering him as her memory returned but mentioning this made Uk angry, so she tried to come up with a different explanation to avoid having him angry at her.  

Uk recognized her as well.  His memories were intact.  She intrigued him from the minute she recognized his energy.  He felt a kinship with her when she mentioned why she was imprisoned. Once they started interacting, he couldn't help but recognize how much she acted like his lost love and that is why he was falling in love, more and more.  It was only insta-love because they recognized each other at some deeper level.

This would not have happened with a random lady, I am convinced of that.

There's very few shows I've disliked the ending more than this. I definitely would've preferred they just ended it in season one as well. 

I feel like Jin Mu ended up really just not threatening at all. His scheming seemed so childish and I couldn't take him seriously with the eyeliner after the switch. And Jang Uk isn't scared of him so why would the audience be invested either?   There was absolutely no risk for any character, even at the end of the world. And the villains also were not even really scared of Uk and just carried on, why? At least try to have them act as if they're moving against the one person who could destroy them. 

I didn't like the fire bird plot at all, it was extremely predictable and played out even worse because the different pieces of it were so separate and the end was so rushed.

I also didn't like the Naksu/Mudeok/Jin Buyeon mess. As if Uk really wouldn't think it could be her after seeing and experiencing how the alchemy works? He's smarter than that, but I guess with how over powered he is he needed some fault to make the plot last. And having her be so slow to gain her powers and memory, it got boring and then it just ended. And it had already been years before this even started! And the memory loss was convenient to continue the love square, hated that. She turned from a player into a game piece and it was super disappointing. Completely destroyed her character growth. 

I liked a few things. I felt like the chemistry Uk and the prince had was great. I was starting to wish they would get together. My favorite relationship in this season is the prince and his turtle. And I like looking at Lee Jae-wook. Imo it's not enough to justify a second season.
> But I can't help but think that Part 2 was an afterthought/extension of Part 1 due to its overwhelming popularity: the continuation seems so rushed to me.

My understanding was that AoS was always meant to be two parts
Symmetry was broken. In part 1, Jang Uk was weak and Naksu was strong(ish) and was all about Naksu helping Jang Ukbgetting stronger. In part 2, Naksu was weak and Jang Uk was strong, but he didnt do anything for Naksu.
completely agree, making him so powerful basically meant that all the amazing fight scenes from season 1 weren't replicated and every "serious situation" just ended up being an afterthought. i was ready for a WAR!!

also i think everyone wanted to see naksu go insane and take out half of jin mu's army while revealing herself at the same time
I kinda think that OP Jang Uk is fine, his season 2 power has been continually foreshadowed throughout season 1. The problem are that Jin Mu's secret org is way too passive and Uk's supposed nemesis i.e the Fire Bird literally takes like 2 moves to finish. They could have had the bird absolutely wreck the kingdom, forcing the King's Star and his 7 companions to seriously tackle it. Instead we got a really short fight scene, budget issues I guess?
I kinda liked that he was so powerful. For me the plot point was that absolute power does not have to absolutely corrupt. He only broke it out to stop an absolute wrong.
I thought the world-building was great at first, but after thinking about it some more, there are elements that don't make a lot of sense. Like: Why do they have all these fortresses, when there's no reference made to any other nations? People build fortresses to defend against potential attacks, not for the hell of it. The whole bit with the fire bird in season 2 was nonsensical as well: Oh yeah, we forgot to mention this gigantic world-destroying creature imprisoned in Jinyowon, which the bad guys are (in an apparent fit of self-destructiveness) about to set loose, but which somehow made it through the previous age of anarchy without anyone trying that. Also, the astrological angle, despite being periodically emphasized, was barely developed at all, except for Uk and the King's Star.

They had the germ of a great idea for an epic fantasy setting, but the follow-through wasn't there; the world ultimately feels rather empty, a pencil sketch rather than a painting. Where season 2 should have been used to develop some of these ideas further, it was wasted on pointlessly (and endlessly) rebooting the Uk/Naksu romance; amnesia is the laziest refuge of writers. Ultimately a disappointing show.
i totally agree with you!! i personally thought the pacing of s2 was fine but i’ll admit that the amnesia part lasted a bit longer than I would’ve wanted. Also I’m a little selfish but the scene where they do realize who each other are and then when they can be together, I felt was a bit underwhelming. I get the context but I wanted some wide smiles, happy tears, and some aggressive ilys😭. 

Also, agree, I didn’t like the more passive role Master Lee took in S2. Since S1, he’s had the answers for most of everything and was a force to reckon with and then suddenly, he’s not and second guessing (like to tell Uk about Naksu and doesn’t because of Jinyowons leader, forgot her name). I get that they believed her soul to be gone after some time but idk I wish I saw more powerful moves from him S2.
I don't agree.  Having the amnesia last til the last episode was necessary for the plot to unfold properly.  They both recognized each other from the start, but couldn't acknowledge it to themselves.  But it was this recognition that formed their bond.  If she had been a random girl, there is no way that Uk would have fallen for her this quickly, broken as he was.

The hints were there from the start, but they both chose not to believe them.  Uk because it was too painful, and Yeong because the mere suggestion made him angry and would have pushed him away.

Uk was a soul-shifter hunter and this had become his only reason for existence.  If he had recognized her, then he would have had to kill her.  Not doing so would compromise everything he was.  We saw that struggle play out with Seo Yul.  He almost went through with his plan to kill her, had circumstances not intervened.  She is a soul-shifter, and as his own death proved, subject to running wild like all the others.   

Personally, I liked the way the plot unfolded.
I agreed with many of your points. On your comment about part 2 being to short, I really believe that you cannot separate the parts but look at it as one long drama. It will work well in binging. I gave it a 9/10.
what you did not like resonates so much with my view as well  


Although i think 8.5 is way generous for it, mydramalist has part 1 at no 7 with 9.1.. Clearly I'm just the oddone who thinks better stories/execution have been done before
This, I agree with everything you said. Nothing ever has lasting repercussions. The firebird clearly burned down most of the city, but then everything is fine and back to normal.

The real star couple of the 2nd season was the turtle and the prince.
Not the Prince and his turtle 😂😂💀
I think they made a mistake announcing that so early.  I did push through and loved season 1.  I did enjoy season 2.  Yes there was a different female lead.  But in a way, she ___IS___ a different person.  Season 1 FL was perfect though.
You didn't miss much in part 2 and yes, part 1 can be stand alone. The tone and overall quality of part 2 was waaay to different than part 1. Comedy in part 2 was also kinda meh.
Watch both seasons.  It's an entire arc.  Switching lead was not a capricious thing, it was integral for the second part.

Don't listen to the haters.  The second part of AoS was great, the leads had absolutely amazing chemistry together.
Quite accurate!
That’s EXACTLY what I thought. Like they knew Netflix was gonna scrap them after S2 so they just wrapped it up and gtfo
I did not give season 2 as low as a mark as you (to me it’s a 6/10 and I feel like I’m being generous) however, I ABSOLUTELY agree with the almost abysmal reduction of female representation in this drama. There were already issues in season 1 with that, but somehow with season 2 they managed to make it even worse.

It’s frustrating. There are so many ways to depict women as strong without it being physically or magically so, and yet they continuously failed to do this with nearly all the female characters. When I first watched season 1, I enjoyed the idea of a “four seasons” with these 4 powerful, capable beings. But the one female representative is never shown as being particularly strong and never on par with the other male leads. Then you have our actual female heroine, who has this great character arc where she loses her powers and must rely solely on her wit to survive (again, this is a different but great perspective of strength in a woman without it being physical). Then, season 2 roles around and she is reduced to not only being powerless but also witless! Her original traits are forgotten along with her memory, and we never see that same strength or wit regained.

Even the most powerful character of the show outside of Jang Uk >!Bu-yeon was never really truly an in-depth character to begin with. She is a reincarnation of a powerful priestess who is never given a unique storyline outside of being the lover of the man who saved the world the first time.!<

They did the females so dirty in season 2. They had every opportunity to give us these beautiful female relationships and show female strength but failed. >!All of our female characters take issue with each other in some way (jealousy over men being one), or are never given opportunity to actually save each other or care for each other. The closest we get is Mu-deok in season 1 being friends with the hostess of the inn, but even that’s completely lost in season 2!<.

There is much to love about this show but its female representation is not one of them, especially in season 2.
>why can't we have female writers? Why can't women also do this kind of work?

I'm confused about this criticism because the Hong Sisters (both women) wrote **both** parts of 1 and 2 of this show. Am I mistaken? Although I do agree that the female characters could've been stronger for sure. But unless there is some article stating that the some men in the production purposefully changed the original story that the Hong Sisters wrote, I don't think the men are to blame here. Hong Sisters wrote the entire story.
Isn't this a little presumptuous? The Hong Sisters have a **lot** of clout/influence. I don't think it's fair to assume that a male production staff member is necessarily to blame... They have a pretty distinctive style of writing and I think it's quite possible that they simply wrote weak female characters as likely as a man was responsible writing/co-writing/co-producing this story with weak female characters...
> The female view of the world is why I watch Kdramas. 

K-dramas are in the chix-flix genre. They are so obviously targeted at women, and they reflect the main wishes of women. So older k-dramas were about young short average poor girls marrying a young tall hot rich guy after being pursued by at least two of them, now many are about 30-something strong, independent career women reinventing themselves and being pursued by younger hot guys. They are the modern equivalent of "bodice rippers", but less raunchy.
so-so acting? oof definitely disagree there. Just wondering which parts you felt the acting felt short
Another hilarious moment was when Dang Gu, Seo Yul and the Crown Prince conspired to help Mudeok cheat the Songrim admission exams.

Top emotional scene (could also be considered baeksang performance) for me was when Mama Jin was strangling Mudeok and Mudeok calls her "mom" just before passing out. I really thought that scene would have been a huge turning point in the story.
> the English Dub for this show (S1). I rewatched some scenes in the dub and I was appalled. I'm not even joking when I ask this- was it fan-made?

Does anyone do that ?  <shudder>

I agree about the chemistry between the leads.  Watching the BTS scenes, there is definitively something there.  I'm pretty convinced Lee Jae Wook has a crush on his lead actress, from the way he looked at her.  Will that turn into something, who knows, but the attraction is there for all to see.
Agree with you about the post drama withdrawl symptoms. I still watch edits of them and still can't get over them and into another drama. I've never been so invested in a kdrama before lol. Thank god we got a happy ending, but even then I was left feeling so empty after it ended.
I never get why y’all say new female lead yet she was always the real Naksu
Interesting comment on fight scenes. I noticed in previous discussions that some people looked for more action scenes. For me, I was there for the love story, which worked. 9/10
It's the exact opposite for me! I loved it so much and the expectations were too high only to be let down. Sigh. I wish I could overlook them but it really  left a bad test in the mouth and ruined the overall watching experience for me.
Same! Honestly, I'm not very objective when it comes to rating TV shows. Alchemy of Souls wasn't the best drama I’ve watched, but it was so good and gave me so much joy for 2 months that I’m ready to ignore all of the flaws it had.
No, you're right. There are quite a few plot holes in the show that I wish the creators considered. I guess we can assume because there was a time jump, people kind of forgot or didn't expect to see her again since they saw her body being burned?
[deleted]
1. Naksu's body is gone forever. The current body belongs to Jin Bu-yeon. The reason it looks like Naksu is because the body recovered using Naksu's soul energy and thus had to adjust to prevent conflict between body and soul. Master Lee explained it in one of the earlier episodes of season 2.

2. No one knows. Up to your imagination or if the Hong sisters ever decide to reveal it.
I agree with you. The outline of the story is so great. It was just the execution of part two that killed it for me.

I think they knew the character beats. But I’m talking more about the artifacts and actions. The bells, the firebird, the ritual to save Yul, etc all felt tossed together. The ice stone could be anything they needed it to be.
All the playfulness of S1 Naksu gone. All the scheming and plotting, and willingness to be ridiculous. Almost all of the supreme overconfidence taken away.
>Despite the amnesia, a person’s underlying character shouldn’t change that much.

Yes it absolutely should. In fact it would be illogical if her character doesn't change drastically. Because your life experiences shape you as a person. If you are REBORN, which is essentially what happened to her, then you are basically a baby. 

Considering she only has 3 years worth of memory and life experiences, she actually show a lot of wit and boldness. She's only like this from Ep1 to Ep8 anyway. After her memory returns, she became more like in S1.
It makes sense for Bu-Yeon to have fallen for him so quickly. She doesn't have any previous memories and she's going through so much so once she finds someone who helps her, she develops feelings. And as her memories start to come back, those feelings grow deeper again. 

My issue was with how Jang Uk fell for her. I understand your perspective, but I guess I couldn't make that transition. To me, she didn't really act like his lost love? The innocent bit was fine, but Naksu was confirmed to be very smart and hardworking as per Jin Mu from S1, so losing her memories shouldn't have turned her into this version of herself. And feeling a spark because he recognized her energy is all fine and dandy but for him to completely fall for her was not convincing to me. 

This is where the writing didn't help. When you want to show a soul deep connection, having a few funny/cute scenes with some serious ones sprinkled in between is the easiest way to do that. But you can't do justice with it.

I don't think this would have happened with any other woman either but I really can't connect S1 and S2 together when it comes to love story. It's a person to person thing though so I completely see why some people loved it.
Oh no, I knew that he technically falls for Naksu but from his perspective, it's a different person... and how much of this Naksu was like the one he previously fell in love with?
> There's very few shows I've disliked the ending more than this. I definitely would've preferred they just ended it in season one as well. 

That would have made the end of AOS rank amongst the worse endings in kdrama history
On an interview with Lee Jae Wook he said that part 2 was discussed to him in the middle of filming Season 1 so it was not always meant to be two parts I think
Yeah, that's something I was disappointed about. Season 1, both parties were always maneuvering and scheming against each other - Songrim wins some, Jin Mu wins some - and both played the cards they were dealt and made the best ofthe situation.

I feel the cat and mouse suffered somewhat in S2.
This is a recurring worldbuilding problem in Korean fantasy (also seen in dramas like Kingdom) where writers create a compelling world at first and then are kinda reluctant to expand them further. We also see this in Chinese dramas outside of Jin Yong adaptations. I attribute this to the Asian TV/film industries being relatively young and so not as willing to take risks as say, Western producers. The Japanese seem to be the only one to break out of this, but then again their live action stuff have the most uncanny way-over-the-top acting ever which makes them kinda off putting.
Story was about internal politics, not external.
It went on for too long indeed. I would have preferred if Jang Uk realized it halfway through and had to deal with her still not remembering or whatnot for example.
Long live the turtle !
I wished they didn't announced it too early too like they should have just surprised at the ending of ep 20. Because the moment I found out that there will be a new FL in season 2 I felt sad watching the rest of the episodes. I still finish S1 tho because it is still so good
So kinda like two different shows ? Great to hear I can just watch part one.
> this is a different but great perspective of strength in a woman without it being physical).

This was what I really loved about Mudeok. Women are generally physically weaker than men, so to see a weak woman, even without any power, manage to stand up for herself like this was so great. Much more relatable than the "tiny but strong" copies of Buffy The Vampire slayer. (But I was also disappointed in the female season's disappearance, suddenly the crown prince was one of the seasons instead of her.)

They could have done lots with the women: 

Example: Both Kim Do Ju  and Ju Wol know everyone in town. They could easily have sussed out lots of suspicious goings-on, even without any magic. 

It could have been made clear that Mama Jin >!said yes to the fire bird thing because of danger of war, and then after that they could have just decided to move to Jinyowon to thank her.!< 

The males could have had mothers. There could have been an adult female nurse in the hospital. Mudeok could have had female servant friends. 

We could have gotten the opportunity to see how priestess power could for example trap a magical tiger soul and make it into a kitten. We could have seen a woman being curious about the world, and going everywhere to experience it all. 

We could have seen female guards that were able to do their job. The conversation between the Queen and Jang Uk could have been with one more person there, or it could at least have been with a Queen who was not quite so stupid. etc etc
I know that the Hong sisters, with some unspecified assistants who could be male or female, wrote *this drama* in particular. Did you not see that I wrote that when Netflix make their own production, (somehow it is suddenly important to be "equal" and) they do fifty/ fifty male / female of writers, but on the TV in Korea, the dramas are to a large majority written by women? That is what makes Korean stories special, and why we have science fiction written by women. And what I hope to continue to enjoy. 

The last part of the comment was not about *this drama in particular*, but a general commentary on film production. 


As to why the second part ended up being so against women, I can only speculate. The previous dramas written by Hong Sisters are not fantastically feminist, but for example in **Master's Sun** there are great female side characters, and some of the "ghost of the week" are also female. 

There are also many women who "*see*" men a little bit more than they *"see*" women. I thought for sure that **Pegasus Market** was written by a man, because of the lack of women. But sometimes it has to do with production, where the director and the producers are male, and each instance cut out a little bit of female content, and suddenly we are left with almost nothing. 

<3 Hong Sisters <3 I hope you get to write a good drama again, and I hope, as I said, that the criticism of this drama reaches whoever it was who created the mess of part two.
They f'ed up the end of Korean Odyssey as well. They totally stole the FL's power and moments of glory and gave it to the ML.
Yes. I wish that entertainment directed towards women had a higher status. Anyway, there are also lots more than just Candy who marries a chaebol; you have many dramas with subjects above this, even within many simple chick flicks there can be interesting dialogue that comments on our society. There are also many dramas that have subjects way beyond what you are talking about. 

Example **Green Mothers' Club**, **Melancholia** and **SKY Castle** about competing with your children, there are many dramas about beauty standards, **Attorney Woo** about autism, **Forecasting Love and Weather** about weather forecasting, **My Liberation Notes** about the depressing daily life, **Twentyfive twentyone** about growing up, **Dali and the Cocky Prince** about the art gallery business etc etc 

The best dramas have more to say than just "fulfil your dreams by watching this". (FLAW is not so good, I should probably not have placed it in such excellent company.) 

I find it interesting that men often dislike romance. It is not as if men don't marry. It could be the way it is written, of course.
Part 2. Everything went downhill in part 2.
It was a huge turning point.  It's what prompted her to save Mudeok.  If not for that, she would have turned to stone at the bottom of the lake and that would be that.
Apparently Netflix decides for you, based on your watch history, whether to default shows to their dubbed or subbed version. The amount of people who watched squid game dubbed is appalling.
Fan-make dubs? It's more popular with animes but yeah I've seen some fanmade kdrama dubs
I know your feeling. I got this way over Lucifer after I discovered it on Netflix.  When Netflix announced, unexpectedly, that they wouldn't put out as many seasons as was expected, I was literally heartbroken.  That's when I lost all desire to watch more series.  This disinterest lasted for years and is actually still ongoing, in western dramas.  Last fall, I discovered k-dramas and everything changed.  AoS was one of the first few I watched and I can credit it with sparking my interest in the genre.

I tend to get obsessive with my current interests so I understand.  The only solution I found is to cut myself off totally for a while.
She wasn't the FL of s1 tho.. it was mu deok, not naksu ..  you can easily say s2 FL was half bu yeong and naksu, none of mu deok. 

Characters were literally played different.. Mu deok had that savage in her that s2 didn't have.
I usually fast forward through fight scenes and, in non-fantasy dramas, car chases. I find them boring or too intense. I didn’t ff through the AOS fight scenes because they weren’t drawn out. To me, they were just long enough and beautifully done.
Thanks bro kudos
okay i see. thank you for explaining!
I tried but something wasnt clicking. The P2 Naksu is beautiful no doubt, but her and Uk aint just for me. Someone was nice enough to summarize the endings of the characters of Part 2 and I am satified that almost all had their own "happy" endings :D nonetheless, this drama is good and I see myself rewatching part 1 from time to time (comedy and chemistry of the leads and side characs is just chef's kiss!)
I'd say both of them were super-powerful by the end, but I wouldn't say they were lacking character flaws--Uk in part 1 is charming, but also spoiled, self-pitying and lazy at points. Naksu, meanwhile, is ruthless enough to poison him and less than kind when he tells her that he missed her too. In Part 2, Uk's less than kind to Bu-yeon. Admittedly, not a lot of flaws with Bu-yeon, which is one of the things that makes her a bit flatter as a character, though they try to give her some of Naksu's traits--she's not meek, but with all the soft focus and stiff costumes, a lot of the energy and fierceness gets lost, though we saw it in the same actress when she plays Naksu in the first episode. I kind of wish they'd given her a costume at the end that had a bit more of the old Naksu in it--i.e. easier to move in, more fluid, but somehow also conveyed her rank as heiress to a dynasty with divine powers. Maybe like the dress Sol-Reun twirls in to bring down the rains.
I'd agree with that. I think they had the overall arc and ending mapped out, but didn't work in some of the details--it would have been easy to foreshadow the bells and make some mention of the firebird earlier.
This criticism makes no sense. All those things you mentioned are only her survival mechanism, because circumstances made her a powerless servant, who had to brown nose people to survive. 

In S2 she is a young lady from a rich family, it makes sense she no longer needs to do those things as much. The only scheming she need to do was when she wants to escape the prison room.
I was reading somewhere else that it was uncanny how Hong Seo Hee was able to channel the character of Naksu.  That it was obvious she had studied season one, and the way Naksu was portrayed.  So to me, that's what we were meant to pick up on.  The subtle mannerisms coming through.  

But of course, we lose a lot, or at least I do because I don't speak Korean, and having to pay attention to the subtitles takes away from watching the faces and picking up these subtle details.  Also, I was some months removed from watching season one, so it wasn't fresh in my mind.  

But think about it.  If you met someone who reminded you strongly of someone you once knew and loved, wouldn't you feel drawn to them?  Even if you weren't consciously aware of the similarities between the two.  I think this is what was meant here.  I think this is why he stayed away from her so much because he was torn between being pulled by her, and feeling he was betraying Mudeok.  It was only when he accepted that she was gone that he could give in.

I think there were a lot of subtleties in this drama that maybe a second rewatch is required to pick up on.
I wouldn't say I've seen enough dramas to determine that lol.
Lol.  I was sad too.  They should not even announce season 2 until we finish season 1.  The suspense was gone after the season 2 announcement.
AoS is a Studio Dragon production though. Netflix is merely a distributor so I don't get how they could have any hand on the writing of this show. Netflix originals so far are Squid Game, Kingdom, Sweet Home and The Glory which all excellently written strong female characters. Your presumption on unspecified Netflix influenced assistants are just shaky.

Hong Sisters fucked AoS up. Everything their assistants write go through their scrutiny and approval. When it comes to writing, there's no one else to be blame but them - not some "unspecified assistant".
I can agree that plot-wise and character-wise it went downhill but i thought the acting was one aspect that stayed strong throughout the series (and the OST too!) Just curious what specific scenes didn't work for you acting wise
I was thinking the other day that it wouldn't be as bad if they chose native speakers who speak with an accent.  Then it wouldn't sound so wrong and divorced from Korean.
Sorry, I meant dubs overall.  I was wondering who listens to dubs.  Even the best-made ones are just awful and cringe inducing.  It sounds so wrong
Blame that on the writing not the actress cause we all saw her fight episode 1
I like to think that her natural inborn personality is one that is super confident, resourceful, and ruthless.  All of which could have been expressed even as a young lady from a rich family.

Sneaking out of her room in episode 1? Great! Confidence in her looks? Check. Sadly no ruthlessness anywhere.
Yeah I agree with you, the subtleties can be missed if you're more focused on subtitles than what's happening on screen  but at the same time, I've never had this issue with any other shows. 

Your explanation makes sense to me but it reiterates my problem with season 2 - if I have to do so much work to make myself believe in their authenticity as a couple, then it's hard to like it as much as I liked season 1. Idk if many felt this or not but this is just my personal gripe, doesn't have to be right or wrong 😅 

On the other hand, had I watched season 2 without having much memory of season 1 (or even skipped the first one) I would liked it so much more.
Here is an example that is burned in my mind.  A slow-burn romance between two people that finally discover happiness together, and in the very last two episodes he goes abroad for treatment and dies.  The end.  Oh, I and guess that the audience really disliked this, so in the very last 5 minutes, he comes back, 3 years later, I'm baaaaack.  I never died.

Completely ruined it.  Rewatch value is negative now
> Maybe all the writers and the production team and everybody got covid, yet tried to muddle through.

The above is a quote from the first of my comments in this thread. It looks like people are unable to understand that it is possible to start a comment writing about one thing, and then go on to write about something related, but not exactly the same.
Yeah they're BAD but some people like to multitask or don't like reading so they watch it dub, I have some friends who do that and I cry for them everytime
Guess what, in S1 we saw Naksu as a child, did she look ruthless to you? We also saw Naksu as a teenager, she threatened to kill Seo Yul because she saw him as her enemy. They show those scenes for a reason. Naksu is not born ruthless.

We all like to think we are born bosses and badasses, but that's simply not the case. Traits such as ruthlessness are not born, they are developed through life. To expect Naksu who has no memory of her tragedy to be ruthless in illogical.
Yes, that might be the issue. I think we needed that break between the two parts to recover from the ending of part one and go through all the stages of grief unto acceptance 😂.

There is no right or wrong really with how people feel about kdramas.
I’ve just finished Dodosolsollalasol and am so annoyed by the lazy ending, which you’ve just described 😱
Yeah, I hear yah.  That is tear inducing. 

 But on the other hand, even in English, I would never do that with a drama that I was interested in.  And if I am not interested in it what's the point of wasting time on it even as background noise?

If I get the urge to have something play in my ears while I work, I'll listen to a youtube video, or an audio-book or a podcast.
By your assertion then, we should consider amnesiac Naksa as NOT Naksu at all. Which is a valid take. But it would be bad storytelling/writing, since the obvious intent and metaphor is that that is Naksu in there even though she doesn't have the memories, and that the soul connection is valid even though she doesn't have the memories. Good storytelling would be providing evidence or hints of the Naksu within, and I think there wasn't enough of that. I don't contest that it makes sense that she acts as a young lady from a rich family, I am of the opinion that the way it was written (and shown), the connection between Naksu-Mudeok and Naksu-Buyeon turned out weak and less convincing.
it was so good otherwise.
Best to move on with another of the many romantic dramas with a decent ending.  Let me know if you need a suggestion.
It's given me heartache, I'm trying to exorcise it by going on reddit and getting some reality in
