I read in a youtube comment (so prob not the most reliable i guess...) that in the webtoon the grandpa's initial rejection of ha ri is just him wanting to play out the 'unreasonable chaebol' fantasy. How i wish they actually did that in the drama! I feel like that would have been way more in line with his character depicted throughout the show. 

Although, discussions with some friends did kind of make me think that maybe what the writers were going for was to show that you might say certain things when it's someone else's family but flip when it's your own in question? Regardless, by the end I did miss the fun and quirky grandpa we saw in the first few episodes :(
 8.5 for me. If only they didn't do a timeskip that contributed nothing and did a double wedding instead, easy 10/10.

Best Rom-com of 2022 so far
This is the only show I have re watched in its entirety multiple times. You can binge the whole thing in just half a day so I'm sure I'll be rewatching it from time to time. I ordered the director's cut blu ray too and now I'm determined to learn korean since it won't have subtitles. I just love this show so much.
Can someone please explain why so many kdramas have rushed endings or bad endings?  Do they just give up or something.

  Buisness Proposal was amazing, I liked that it was only 12 episodes, the cast was great but the ending fell flat for me.  I didn't know about the webtoon before watching the show but having the grandpa fall ill and the time jump made no sense.
The ending was realllyy rushed
Writers: How do we end this show? There are so many plot holes and loose ends to wrap up!

Audience: Oh boy, they left so much for the final episode, I bet it will be a masterpiece!

Writers: I give up. Leeeerrrrooyyyy Jennnnkins!
8.5 for me, i was obsessed with the first half and i still enjoyed the rest but for some reason i just stopped caring as much towards the end? was definitely more invested in the second leads too!
I'm sure that I'll watch this drama many times in the future.
My wrap up comment is simple. 

**Kim Min-Gyu and Seol In-Ah need their own show to lead.**

They have great chemistry. It would be a waste not to capitalise on that with another show.
I don’t really think that this drama is really a masterpiece level drama, but it entertained me, and for someone who mainly watched thriller and melo dramas, it’s nice to have something in between to boost my serotonin. 

The main attraction pf this drama is the character itself instead of the plot. Honestly the plot is cliche in the long run, like you’d definitely expect the ending like that. But anyways, even if it’s cliche, the characters make it interesting. 

In all, I’d give it 7/10
I went to watch episode 13 and was aghast that it was 12 episodes not 16. So disappointed 

WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT

Amazing show but ending was just like.... I'm here now yey
Easily one of my favorite shows in a very long time. I got hooked from the start (well technically week 2 when I started), and still can't move on haha. 

Hatae was fantastic to watch, from their blind dates to falling in love to becoming a couple, despite all the odds. I love how they never broke up because...reasons, and they pushed through to the end. Same goes for the second leads, they were fun to watch too. Food Dev Team 1 were great side characters as well. 

Regardless of how it ended, I still think it was nice to >!end on the proposal given the name of the series.!< Could they have done more, sure! But I was reading that they maybe had some production issues throughout and dealt with Covid, so that may of caused some things to change. Despite the circumstances, the cast and crew really proved their worth. 

Probably a 9.5/10. And just for reference, I consider something like Kingdom a 10/10 and my all time favorite. ABP is short and easy to pick up to rewatch (already did). I bet SBS is already regretting ordering only 12 eps, since this did some very good numbers in viewership/ratings.. It's also a good starting Kdrama as I got some of my friends hooked on it!

Also, if you can't move on like me, The Swoon posted these two fantastic reels [1](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CchSLGaAibc/) [2](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CcPylBHgxQ6/) showcasing favorite lines and a spelling lesson 😀

Oh and did I mention the OST?! I listen to its playlist on the daily during work. You Are Mine, Sun Shower, & Spring Breeze are my personal favs, but dang every single one is so good. I can always picture the scene(s) that go with each one lol
This isn't really my genre, and I feel these types of dramas (much moreso than other kdramas) are made primarily with women in mind (I'm a dude), but...

The first half of it was really enjoyable. The fake dating antics (rachel and samantha lmao) were pretty fun, and I loved the friendship dynamic between the FLs. 

The actual romance fell flat for me though. I read this somewhere in a reddit comment and I agree 100% - taemoo had much, much better chemistry with Geum-hi than he did with Ha-ri. The main romantic pairing fell apart for me pretty much the moment Ha-ri's cover was blown. Unpopular opinion here, but I never liked the second couple. The guy was just so boring. He had like 3 facial expressions, and idk, never saw the chemistry there on his end. 

The ending was also just a trainwreck plot-wise. IMO this drama did comedy much better than romance, and they should've stuck to it. I'd give it like a 7/10.
It's a good series that unfortunately ended in a non-satisfying way. We never got to see how the main couple presents themselves in their workplace environment. They started the Grandpa got sick arc and then just ended it by saying "he'll be in the US to heal." We never got an answer whether or not Grandpa has accepted her. And then we didn't even get to see the post marriage life where Hari and Grandpa fighting over the kid. A solid 7/10 series for me still but honestly could have been much more. I think 14 episodes might have done this series justice.
For those who’ve watched the entire show, can you tell me if this show is **worth continuing**?

I started watching business proposal since it came highly recommended on this sub. The first few episodes were fantastic and I really couldn’t stop binge watching it!

However now, I’m about 8 episodes in, and the leads have become a couple and the plotline seems to be lagging a bit. The pace is also slower and the chemistry seems a little weaker.

Honestly, i don’t know how to explain this very well.. >!but I loved the chemistry between the leads when the FL was Shin Geum Hui. You could feel the sparks flying between them. However, now that Kang Tae Moo knows she is Shin Ha Ri, the relationship is a bit insipid. It feels like there is an obvious power imbalance between the leads and our heroine is a little subdued!<.

Anyway, will the plotline and chemistry improve in the remaining episodes of the series? I mean I loved the first half so much, I want to give this show a chance till the end. Should I continue watching?
I just want to share this dramabeans alternative ending which made me laugh so much.

https://www.dramabeans.com/2022/04/fix-that-ending-two-weddings-and-a-business-proposal/
Agree with everyone - they kinda game of thrones’d it a bit for me with the ending, so if I did rewatch I’ll probably skip the last ep. 

Theres so much good stuff ep 1-11 though that I will deffo rewatch.
Honestly a 9.5/10 for me. I absolutely love this drama and I'm seriously reconsidering a rewatch (which is rare, the only kdramas I've rewatched were Itaewon Class, It's Okay to Not Be Okay, ans You're Beautiful). 

The 0.5 off is due to the rushed ending 😭. But I've heard they're gonna release 4 more episodes? Does anyone know when and how to watch them?
**9/10**

The 1 point is for the ending. I loved everything except the way it ended. 

The leads and the second leads had exceptional chemistry. The way the storyline was written was so good! It was funny, it had very light moments, handled trauma so well.

The entire hospital situation/disapproving grandpa were plots that were not needed. I would have loved to see them in a relationship and them getting married, going on double dates.

Quite easily one of the best rom-com's I've watched in a while.
Soompi understands our feelings which is why they shared [this article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1520946wpp/what-to-watch-next-if-youre-having-a-business-proposal-withdrawal) for what we can watch if we’re having ABP withdrawal symptoms.
9/10 cute romcom, funny play on all of the kdrama tropes, good looking cast, the humor/jokes are on point!
If anyone is disappointed by the way the ending was rushed or feels like there were still stuff needed to be addressed, please read the manhwa. The drawings are soooo well done, the story while a bit different is much more immersive and it’s fun!
The 2nd couple is so refreshing.
After finishing every kdrama, I tend to mentally file it under one of 3 buckets:

* Tier 1: Masterpiece, Genre-defining Quality

* Tier 2: Entertaining, Compelling, Cotton Candy for the Eyes


* Tier 3: Why Did I Even Watch It




Business Proposal fits in the upper end of Tier 2 for me.
9/10 for me like many others. This was the most enjoyable rom-com for me so far and really one of my favourite dramas ever. The story is captivating, the characters are all nuanced and well-presented, the casting was great and the comedy was top-notch. But the best thing was the creativity of it all - the concept, the dialogue, the foreshadowing, the Geumhi-drama within the drama. Including many dreaded kdrama tropes, while at the same time parodying them or purposely poking fun at how ridiculous/unrealistic/cringy they are was a genius concept, and executed very well.

I’m usually strict when it comes to rating stuff so anything higher than an 8.5/10 from me is nearly impossible to see 😂. I wanted to give it a 10 but they fumbled the ending. They built so much momentum for most of the drama only to have an ending that truly lacked impact. No, we didn’t need a wedding and the nod to the title by ending on a proposal was cute, but the overall plot and writing got so messy in such a short amount of time.
8/10. It was a nice, fun show but I feel quite overhyped. I don’t think this series will be remembered in a few months/years. Fun to watch while it was running, with a flat ending, but nothing stays in my memory as a standout moment sadly. However, loved the second couple! I need to see more series with the 2ML!
I loved it. A 9/10 for me. I'm a sucker for rom-com anyway. It has good rewatch value too.
Did they ever disclose why only 12 episodes were released/ordered instead of the original 16? Was it lack of confidence in the leads? It would certainly explain the abrupt ending.
Honestly, they had only one hour to tie up everything, but they dragged the whole grandpa’s act way too long. We could have had important character developments and resolutions made within those precious minutes and ended with a satisfying wedding for both couples and a wholesome ending instead. Another scene that I felt like was a waste of time was the whole closure scene between Hari and Minwoo. I felt like it was totally unnecessary. I feel like most of the scenes and tropes in the last two episodes were spelled out with an unnecessary amount of detail rather than the earlier episodes which thrived on its ability to execute a trope in a quick, simple and humorous manner, or twist a trope and catch us by surprise. I feel like the production team gave attention to the wrong areas after ep 10, deleting scenes that were necessary and keeping scenes that were unnecessary. If they so much wanted to include those tropes in the final two episodes, they could have put those in the drama within the drama and restored one of the charms that attracted everyone towards Business Proposal in the first place. Still, I have had my fair share of experience being disappointed by loose ends and unsatisfactory writing for dramas that promised much better, and given the original premise of Business Proposal and the amount of tropes that was thrown in at the last minute for the last two episodes, I was satisfied as I think they tied up everything fairly well. I guess I’ll give it a 9/10 anyways, because it really lived up to my expectations despite the drawbacks.
Just came to say hey everyone! And yeah, I agree with most of the comments here. The ending was such a huge letdown compared to the previous 11 eps. I really wish they'd make season 2 where the first episode is Gramps walking into Haris parents chicken restaurant where they are watching his favorite drama. Gramps eats chicken while watching the drama and accepts Hari. That's all I want, I don't care if the rest of season 2 turned into a hot mess, I just want to see a chicken wing in Gramps hand.🍗
My biggest takeaway from this drama is --- Young Seo is probably the greatest kdrama character I've ever seen. Not only is she rich, but she seems to have her sh\* together. She has good moral values despite her questionable family, and she swoons over a crush just like a normal person would DESPITE being insanely attractive herself. A lot of the time, "beautiful" characters in kdramas are aware of their attractiveness and use it to their advantage or become too confident and self-absorbed. Not her, she knows her worth but not to the point of being snooty. She makes friends with everyone and doesn't seem to see social hierarchies between her "kind" - the rich, and the middle-class/poor. She's very good with elders and kids too and she's fun-loving and free-spirited and a good drinking buddy to boot! She's practically a perfect character and I wish I could see a kdrama with a character like her and hopefully acted by Seol In Ah too!
7/10 for me. The ending was terrible and it could have so easily been a 10/10 with a simple light ending. Also, the lead couple was frustrating at times as the FL was ALWAYS on edge and you only see her relaxed in their relationship for one date. The SL couple really made the show watchable and gave me a break from being frustrated with the leads.
Find watch but I just feel like the ending wasn't satisfying like what was that?
It's been 2 weeks since the finale but Business Proposal never left my mind. So here are a few thoughts.   
1. The series peaked in its first half and after that it got a lil boring. It isn't about the couples getting together. It's more about having a lil interesting storylines. The accident, grandpa's illness and time skip did nothing

2. Unlike others I like that the series has 12 ep cause if it followed the 16 ep format it would've become another WWWSK and that was sooo boring after ep 8.

3. I may get a lil hate for this but many of the kissing scenes of HaTae couple looked awkward. Idk whether it's the angle or the lighting. AHS and KSJ don't look like bad kissers at all but something felt off. Even their intimate scene. They could've gone for one or two close-up shots

4. Last and final one. I liked the second couple way more than the mains and I watched every ep for them and anticipated for their scenes so I was very disappointed when their screentime kept reducing after ep 8. Their kissing scenes have more views than the main couple's scenes and we all know how viral that "glasses kiss" went. After seeing the BTS of their scenes I feel like the series didn't do Kum Mingue and Seol Inah justice. Even their intimate scene was given some kinda vignette editing and was very short when it's quite clear that they shot more. The highway proposal was really cute but there's no way Youngseo would stand like a wax doll cause that wild girl would definitely jump in joy and shower her man with kisses. I was really happy with Sunghoon investing in Inah's business but I really wish we had a double wedding instead of the disease drama. In that way we'd see the best friends-marrying-best friends trope. End of rant.
Seol In ah and Minkyu really stole the show for me, I found myself looking forward to their scenes more than the main leads. Been following Minkyu since Snowdrop, and I like how even if he’s acting silent/reserved it doesn’t feel stiff. Seol In Ah’s character is amazing, she balanced both being elegant yet straightforward and a bit crazy at the same time. Wish they could get leads soon!
8/10 for me or a bit lower. I found the SL couple far more engaging than the primary couple which is problematic. And—this may be an unpopular opinion—the main couple sex scenes were unconvincing. Still, overall a nice light drama but not one I’ll rewatch.
I really liked it!! I thought the ending was a little flat but I won’t harp on it too much. I was preoccupied with the ending of certain drama (🥲) so that might have contributed to my lack of excitement 😂😭

I would have liked at least one wedding & more family interactions between tae moo and hari’s family and Vice versa. Also the proposals were cute but they didn’t leave a lasting impression for me 😭

Overall, it was really funny and cute! I was really hooked the majority of the time. KSJ was great, I kind of wish AHS was a little… looser if that makes sense?? I’ve watched him in ABP and Lovers of the Red Sky and he just comes off as stiff sometimes like acting wise. I don’t think he’s bad though 😊

8.5/10 for me 💙
I'm currently rewatching this with friends and I'm still enjoying it. 


It's so rare to find a full cast bursting with so much chemistry that it spills over to their characters and the whole show. I love the humour the show brings to the table like the parodies and friendship dynamics. But perhaps I'm really impressed by how well the director executed the script. This could have been your regular romcom but there were so many details and execution >!like the character were talking about how unrealistic it was that the rich character in Geumhi's drama was having coffee at a regular chain coffee shop and getting his order himself and then it suddenly cuts to Granpa doing the exact same thing. I couldn't stop laughing!< that made this show a lot more enjoyable. 

Sejeong and Seol In-ah were just the best duo on screen and off screen. The supporting cast were fantastic. I'm gonna remember Team 1 and Jo YooJung for a very long time.

Also, I just wanna rave about how funny these scene are: >!when drunk Hyeji asked Grandpa if he's wearing a wig!< and the scene >!where Yoo Jung and Young Seo were having their moment in the car. It was so hilarious I couldn't stop laughing!<
I am well aware of the weakness in an unsatisfactory ending that many viewers have talked about. During the one-year time skip, Grandpa missed a lot of things: accepting Hari, gathering with in-laws, appeasing Sung-hoon's father-in-law...; Taemu and Hari, the most adorable couple, escaped our eyes; we also lost sight of Hari's amusing family...

In short, we lost some very important events duo to the unnecessary sick leave of Grandpa, and even Taewu. We lost the pleasure of seeing two weddings and some possible dates.

However, if not treating the show technically but only to measure it emotionally, I would give at least 9.5. Call me biased and blind, but that's how much I love it. 

Great fun watching this show, like so many of us. 

Thanks for the Wrap-Up thread.
It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a drama with as amazing chemistry as the leads in Business Proposal. Not only the two couples have great chemistry but the friendships between the two male and two female leads felt genuine too.
Let’s discuss best funny moments:
for me, 
1. That archaeopteryx running joke was really funny. 
2. The hari slapping taemoo and him crawling out of the cinema, hilarious. The whole plot of him wanting to woo her and her having no clue was so funny. 
3. Yeongseo blowing the stream back because it was crossing across the line. Very cute, very funny. 
4. Drunk coworkers mentioning grandpa’s wig. (The actor irl uses wigs). So funny.
9/10 for me. Ending was ok (could’ve been better) but I think I read somewhere there was production issues due to COVID so I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt (if true).

Honestly everything else was so fantastic. This drama had the perfect blend of my type of humor mixed with sexual tension mixed with romance. Even the usual cliche storyline was brought to new life - mostly because all the cast was 10/10 and the characters were SO likeable. I cannot even think of one character I didn’t care for which is unheard of for me in a kdrama lol. I just loved everything and everyone so much, and the chemistry was great. 

I will say the ML actor was a little… wooden? In the beginning? I don’t know if he’s been in a lot of comedy type roles or if that was an acting choice but by the end he seemed a lot more comfortable. Just an observation - not a knock on his acting skills or directors choices.

Overall, this may be my new fave romcom to date. Great cast, great OST, good fun and definitely on my rewatch list.
Even if it did not end perfectly as we expected, this show was amazing. I noticed I was already hooked on 5min30 at the first episode. And as I am a heavy skipper, I often skip most of the first episode where presentations are often boring to me. 

My quote is 9,9 rounding to 10 because it is in my opinion the best rom-com ever and I rewatched the episodes while it was airing. This was also first time for me.
I started to watched because of second leads. 

I finished to watch because of second leads. 

They stole the show and my heart, cute and refreshing couple!
2nd couple stole show and arguably made show better than what was projected
The first six episodes are a masterpiece in my opinion. But after that things slowly started to go downhill. I feel like the chemistry between Taemu and Geumhui was really strong and playful. So after Hari's real identity got revealed their relationship felt like a watered down version of what they had before. I know a lot of people loved the main couple but they got really boring for me once they got together. Despite all the development their relationship got, it felt very lackluster and hollow. I understood why Taemu liked Geumhui but I don't think the qualities he found attractive in Geumhui were ever strongly showcased in Hari. Also Hari's feelings for Taemu seem to come out of nowhere. Prior to getting together we only had a few scenes where we see Hari find Taemu attractive. But that's more like lusting over someone rather than thinking they're attractive. I was rooting for them for the first half of the show but when Hari finally confessed her feelings, I didn't feel any excitement whatsoever. It all felt a bit forced. I also kind of hate how they changed Taemu's entire character once he fell in love. He's supposed to be this workaholic but the moment he fell in love he's a completely different person. To the point that it's hard to believe or take him seriously. 

On the other hand, the second couple were my favorite part of the show despite their lack of scenes. The chemistry between the characters was amazing and they had a very fun dynamic. It's a real shame that they didn't get much screentime in the show thus their relationship never really got to blossom on screen the way it could have. I really hope Inah and Minkyu get their own drama at some point cause they clicked so well together.
Main leads were boring.
Thanks for this info. ❤💚💜
Reflecting back, initially I thought the drama was so good. But now I think the ending or later episodes were lacking. Did we get a happy ending? >!Yes, technically!< The delivery could have been better. The ending doesn't match the writing and style from most of the episodes. Overall still a very very good drama that I didn't want to end but I am satisfied. Worth a rewatch too! My Mondays and Tuesdays are now back to being the days I look forward to the least.
This show was right down my alley! I actually started watching it a day before the last episode aired so I had the opportunity to binge-watch it and boy am I glad I did because I would not have been patient enough to wait for the episodes to come out. 

It was hilarious and fluffy in all the right places and did not have any unnecessary "I will break up with you now because of this small miscommunication issue we have been having for the past 3 episodes" or "we used to know each other when we were kids but the something traumatic happened and here we are" scenarios. 

What I found a little repetitive and annoying was Tae-mu's grandfather and his disapproval of the Ha-ri x Tae-mu relationship. It dragged on for unnecessarily long and the old man acted like a child imo, he could have just gotten over that in one episode. Plus, when Yeon-Seo's father also disapproved of her relationship with Sung-Hoo the show got really boring for me. I would have rather prefered more scenes with the four of them hanging out together because I never really got to see Tae-mu and Sung-Hoo's relationship as friends (I understood they grew up together but tbh I only saw the as strictly professional colleagues - no chemistry for me, especially when I compare their relationship to Ha-ri and Yeong-Seo). 

Also, I really wanted the drama to end on a double wedding ngl and was a little disappointed we never saw Ha-ri's extra reaction to Yeong-Seo's engagement. 

Overall this is a solid 9/10 for me.
It's extremely rare for me to wish a drama had more episodes but ... damn do I wish this had 2 or 3 more to flesh out the end game. I feel like we didn't really get to see the results of the journey and it felt so unsatisfying when the drama was otherwise fantastic.

Perhaps the most disappointing thread left unresolved was >!grandpa's approval.!< I feel like they set up so many opportunities to bring that full circle. I was waiting >!for him to be watching the drama and have a light bulb moment. We also saw him appreciating a roadside bun stand and I was hoping that would come into play with him appreciating Ha Ri's family's chicken shop. Instead we got a random off-screen approval that felt like a total letdown for what had been being built up. Ha Ri/Geum Hi and grandpa's relationship was arguably one of the most important in the show and I hated how it was swept under the rug in the end.!<

I think it would've been nice to see Young Seo's >!business thriving and maybe some kind of resolution with her cousin!<. Also not *necessary* but I thought we'd get more of a heart-to-heart moment with >!Ha Ri and Ha Min. His character didn't really have a point and I feel like it was a missed opportunity to give him a little depth.!<

I enjoyed the majority of the drama so much but it just ended so abruptly. I wasn't even mad about the>! random long distance relationship break because it's just one of those kdrama things !<and I thought it was handled quickly enough and without any drama.

I still enjoyed the majority of the episodes a lot. The first 8 eps were *perfection* imo, I almost never watch dramas as they are airing, but this one drew me in. (And I've been following Byungchan since his idol debut, though that didn't keep me from waiting until TKA was fully aired to watch.) I also had no idea Kim Se Jeong was an idol! Props to her because she's been a fantastic actress in everything I've seen her in.
After reading so many spoilers and comments on the last episode. I actually never bother to finish the last episode. I was still stuck at the early 10min ish..

Not planning on finishing it too. Just couldn't handle the disappointment.

I rather read the webtoon again. LOL
Didn’t think it was possible for the show to end with only ten minutes but it was done.  Felt rushed...Disappointed 😔
This drama was so good but... They really messed up the ending 😩 Episode 12 would have been a good EPISODE but it sucks as an ending. All they needed to do was give us a wedding and it would have been great!! You'd think that kind of cliche ending was the obvious route for a cliche drama but apparently not :'(

I really did quite enjoy it though!! I wish grandpa didn't disapprove of their relationship, but I guess they needed some kind of final conflict... I love both the drama and the manhwa equally, despite their differences.

On another note, the english translation of the manhwa released the latest special chapter today and there was a scene where >!Hari asked Taemu to leave work separately and just meet in front of a theater so that it would feel like "a real date" but Taemu ended up riding the same train cart as Hari without her noticing. Then he approached her but she got startled and yelled "pervert!!!!" with Taemu saying "W-wait! Hari, sweetie...!" as Hari punches him LMAOOO!< I swear I could just imagine drama!Hari and drama!Taemu doing that... Really made me wish we could get special episodes but alas
Gramps was uncharacteristic and grumpy for way too long that it made the last episodes lifeless. It's a shame because he's my fav character. I mean, the ending isn't terrible, but it could have been so much better. The first few episodes were fantastic though, and I liked the 2nd couple.
Decided to binge the show 2 days ago honestly from seeing netflix constantly show this as soon as I opened the app and the positive discussion on here. Usually not a fan of romances that start out with lies like this, but I'm glad around episode 5 that was resolved early. Loved it!
the manhwa was better. idk what to say in terms of rating. i’ll give it a 6/10 just for being funny and what not but other than that my justifications for -4 is because, 

1. they left out so many things from the webtoon that could’ve benefited the show in a better way. i have yet to finish the webtoon but the fact that i’m like 50 chapters in and the show itself ended at 12 episodes with a major time skip and no flavour to the progression of the main couples relationship should say something about the missing plots

2. shin geum hi in the manhwa was so much more powerful, feminine and straightforward, while the one in the kdrama was just some ditzy quirky girl in and out of character. it just irked me so much that she had two different personas and the both of them weren’t even that far off from each other. the girl they casted in general just either didn’t fit the versatile role or the makeup/costume crew just did shin geum hi hella dirty with her ratty wig and “glamorous makeup” that just looked plain as hell, even for her character

3. i feel like they just casted two good looking people to play the main couple because they lacked chemistry and synergy in my opinion. everything just seemed so awkward and cringy between them. the side couple remained my favourite for both the webtoon and the show itself. 

4. the lack of hamin plot/screen time. idec. hamin in the manhwa added FLAVOUR >! to the side couples relationship growth !<

overall, if you liked the show, then definitely read the manhwa because the show did the manhwa dirty
EP 1-5 were so good but I lost interest when Shin Geum Hee disappeared. 

I think the ML fell for Geum Hee, not Hari. 💔
I'm struggling to finish this before my Netflix expires this week. Which is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to watching it the last few months. But I'm just not connecting with it and it was a struggle for me to make my way to episode 10, which is where I am right now.
8/10. BP didn’t stick the landing. The last two episodes were not that good and the ending was underwhelming. Overall, a good drama.
I finished it with a lot of fast forwarding. First, I don’t like comedy. It’s not my genre. All the exaggerated facial expressions and pratfalls annoy me. It’s not the show’s fault. I was curious to see why everyone seemed to like this show. 
Second, the main leads is were meh not great.
I give it a 6/10.
I’m not saying that I didn’t like it but the WEBTOON was way better. It would’ve actually been way better if they followed the WEBTOON almost completely (some arcs from the WEBTOON can be easily cut without having a significant impact). The ending wasn’t really satisfying and the change in plot with regards to Grandpa’s disapproval of HaRi and her relationship with MinWoo was just random and meh
I’m so sorry but if ABP is the best Kdrama/romcom you’ve ever watched then…

It’s light-hearted and funny. I liked that it overdid the romance and comedy aspects such that it wasn’t cringey but a lot more enjoyable to watch. 

Now don’t get me wrong, it’s a great feel-good drama and I’ll admit that. But the lack of chemistry (and acting abilities) between the leads made the show pretty mediocre for me. Probably the most important reason why this show kind of fell a bit flat was that there wasn’t a deeper meaning behind it. It was just… a chaebol falling in love. We didn’t even see much of them overcoming those obstacles. 

It’s great and all, but I really wouldn’t call it a masterpiece or the best drama/romcom out there. I caved in to watch it because of the hype and I thought it was pretty disappointing for me.

edit: since we’re rating, this is a 7/10 for me.
Now that the drama's had some time to sink in and I've found other dramas/ literature that are curing my hangover well, i can write about BP more objectively.

From a purely technical point of view (pacing, writing, directing) there were definitely things that could have been done better. It was a bit rushed, and the writing in the last ep, although it worked for me (im easy to please when it comes to this drama), i can see how it left viewers feeling a bit disgruntled. Dramabeans did an alternative ending post which I thought was pretty good. Also unpopular opinion: KMG is cute but for me he was the weakest link in terms of acting, though everyone else's overall chemistry made it less noticeable. I think it might be coz he's older than the rest/ personality differences irl? 

I don't expect everyone to agree to this next comment I'm going to make (of course.... hahaha), and it is very rare i say this about kdrama leads, but AHS and SJ's chemistry as TM and HR was f**king INSANE. The last kdrama i watched with leads who even came close was Secret Garden, 11 years ago, and this tops that by a mile or two or more (for me anw. Lol). I'm a sucker for this shizz unfortunately, so dont mind me (but if you are so inclined you can join the conversation on Twitter!). 

Which brings me to my next point. I think one reason why the ending worked for me was because of who I understand AHS and SJ to be as entertainers in general (acting, and for SJ singing as well). Of course I might have just drunk the Kool-aid and be looking at everything with rose-tinted lenses but hear me out.

With another lead actress, heck maybe even another director, a double wedding and more cutesy would have worked, would have been necessary just to wrap up the drama. But then what kind of drama would it have been? Just another cliche romcom to add to the list of cliche romcoms that came before it. What made this drama special for me was the realness of the usual declamations made/ arcs covered in eps 10-12. The what is now my favourite kdrama sequence rainy day date, TM assuring HR's dad of his intentions to protect HR, even that dratted scandal (have you been following real life? Hahahaha) and how TM and HR reacted to/ handled it - i felt that because of the kind of entertainers AHS and SJ are in real life, they were able to handle and convey these very real emotions that resonated so deeply, so there was no need for anything more. (And I will add, where is the line, really, between life and the sort of art that makes you feel this way?) 

That said, it did give the drama an indie sort of vibe/ feel at the end, when at the start there was more of a balance between the sweet and the slapstick? That's probably my main criticism. 

An enjoyable watch, and for the reasons above, an 8.5-9ish/10 for me. Will probably rewatch at some point (have already rewatched my fave bits of course and no that doesn't include the last part of ep 11. Hahahahaahahaha)
10/10 just for that (painful) >!Tonkatsu!< SLAP!
No resolution between Grandpa and Ha Ri and the weird sudden trip to NYC. Without those two weird choices this drama would have been all time great. So so close
9/10 for me. The ending brought it down from a 10 - really wish the last episode was executed better. Other than that, it was an amazing show. Mr. Gye had to be my fav character. I was cracking up with my wife every time he was on! 😂
It was binge-worthy, interesting, exciting, and its OST was really good. The chemistry of each character is well done (2nd FL and ML chemistry are off the charts!!) and I was invested in it. My only complaint is the ending, it was rushed. It's 9.45/10 for me. I can't move on to this show, it is one of the best!

P.S. Thanks to this show, I discovered Se-Jeong and I started to stan her. She is really a Goddess!!  


P.P.S Part of me wants to see news about the real-life dating of the second leads of this show.
9/10 only and only because of the ending. It’s an easy watch and One that you can rewatch again and again. I loved all four leads and I’m really hoping inah and Mingyu will pull a lee dong wook and yoon na on us
This was SO close to being a 10/10 for me! I'd say 8.5/10  
The last two episodes kind of ruined it for me. But I'd still recommend it and tell people if they need to laugh and have fun with some romance, this is a great one to do. It also has really strong characters and funny interactions that I didn't realize I wanted in a comedic drama. Some episodes have good rewatch value.
I never expected to love this romcom as much as I did. The performances and situations the characters were put in were so over the top but done so in a non-annoying way if that makes sense. Even loved the cousin!
I'm already ready for a re-watch! I loved the characters in this drama, their development, and how we got to know everyone so well. It really felt like their relationships progressed in a natural way too, on top of being funny and romantic! I can easily re-watch this drama multiple times which isn't the case for most of the ones I've seen 😄
It’s been awhile since a drama made me become such big fans of the actors! I agree with everyone that the ending felt rushed, but by the 12th episode, I didn’t care about the plot as much as seeing Hyoseop and Sejeong on screen. The director and all the actors mentioned the difficulties due to COVID, so it’s unfortunate that they had to work around things and probably couldn’t produce what they were imagining.

I adore the characters and the way that love and relationships were portrayed in different ways. All of the green flags!! A true romcom that makes you swoon. Typically there’s a stage of a show or the characters’ relationship that isn’t as fun to watch and I’ll skip over it, but I love that I can rewatch ANY of the 12 episodes and enjoy every second of it.

I’m now watching Uncanny Counter because of Sejeong and will definitely be watching everyone’s future works 😍
Felt like watching “she was pretty” all over again. Same plot same key-moments overall a 4/10. Liked the dynamic of mr. Cha
Very very well executed rom-com, full of butterflies and cringe in the best manner possible. One of the bests this year (and its just the first half!)
This is heart warming show .....☁️🌸it's chilling and you can watch while you eat snacks ...the characters are my favourite ..the way they shown shin hari is admirable, the best duos both the k couples are fantastic... their friendship and interaction....also the work environment is not boring at all it's funny thou ....and shin ha is a researcher ...so much information I love it ...if anyone is thinkin to watch please watch no time to waste truly .
Thank you
Genuinely surprised me that it ended so abruptly, i agree with you all on the potential scenes there was so much more for the show to go too

Sigh, still loved it though
Loved it ! Loved the pace ! Wish it was at least 2 eps longer ! Best feel good drama this year
I didn't know the show ended at episode 12 and was like oh well at least I'll have four more episodes.
If this drama is this GOOD AND LOVED, I wonder how well Positively Yours will do
Episode 1-10 is good, episode 11-12 suffers from trying to cram too many plot lines and trying to resolve them in 2 episodes. Perhaps if there were 16 episodes the pacing at the end would be better. 

Overall 8.5/10 for me.
Does anyone know/have resources or can ID Tae-moo/Sung-hoon’s suits and outfits?!
Fun ride, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. It didn't stick the landing for the last episode, managing to be just "okay", but I had a fun ride nontheless.

I feel that in terms of chemistry, it was interesting because Tae-mu and Geum-hi's dates are the pop and sizzle and the fancy excitement of the just started dating couple where both parties are out to impress each other; otoh, Ha-ri and Tae-mu's dates are the more down to earth, more comfortable dating of a couple that's not trying to impress each other, but instead trying to get to know each other. The breakfast date where he cooks for her, the rain dinner date where she keeps bringing him to do different things so as to not trigger his ombrophobia... I felt those had a quieter, more intimate feel. I liked those.

Also, Kim Se-jeong singing the ED for the final episode was just, chef's kiss. That and the proposal did a fair bit to salvage the final episode from being a complete failure.
I'm still confused as to why the flowers shin ha ri got thanos snapped in that one episode, anyone know?
Will they release 4 additional episodes?
The drama was sooooooo cheesy that it was good lololol. Characters were funny (especially the cousins) and the villains were also not really the worst villains where you’d really really despise them. Overall, gave me some good laughs so 8/10. That being said, some annoying things:

- Ending was the worst possible ending ever. The grandpa falling ill, the time skip, the random proposal on a random street. None of it made sense.

- their sex scene was a bit awkward lol, like it was dragged on and slow and the chemistry wasn’t really there imo 

- I wish we got to see career growth for seong-hun. I feel like he’s always in the shadow of people. Whether it’s tae-moo or young-seo, he supports people from behind. But when do we get to see seong-hun shine for himself?
I have a question and don’t know if it was lost in translation or I just missed it, but >!is the nun Sung-Hoon’s biological mother or just the head of the orphanage and therefore he sees her as his mother? And then he was adopted by Tae-Mu’s parents and so grew up with Tae-Mu like brothers and that’s how he ended up working as Tae-Mu’s personal secretary? Is there more to the story that I missed?!<
It was definitely a fun series, the description led me to believe it would be more along the lines of " start up " having not read the manhwa first.

It was a fun watch, with very cheesy romance at times I couldnt help laughing at, I enjoyed the overall premise as well as main and side cast.. however a few characters felt redundant like the co worker romance.. the other sister/cousin who mixes english with korean etc I felt the show would not have changed if they werent present but can see why they are there to help the plot 

There were times it felt very rushed and felt it was probably a 16 episode series cut down

The main good point for me was the " shin guem hi " charade was ended early and then it just became a battle of romance but also not letting everyone else find out which was much more enjoyable

The ending wasnt the best and I didnt realise I was there until I checked the episode length, while the happy ending is expected as with all Kdrama 

I wouldnt rush to watch it again but for a one time view I give it a 6/10
It's pretty boring to be honest it's good for entertainment for chilling but the characters are stereotyped, nothing special from the drama itself, the message is still the same thing, the casts are overreacting especially the male leads, that's why Im not excited for season 2. 3/10
I have this habit of watching Kdramas that are already completed than watching them while they are on going. I decided to watch it mainly because of the actors. They are fun. But this Kdrama was so cliché. Always the same line "He is so hot."
"He is so good looking."
"Fake relationship."
"Bright and out going FL."

But I liked it. Hahaha! It's fun.
This is my 2nd kdrama, and I’ve already watched it twice and On to the third.

How do people have a life after watching President Kang?
What is Young-Seo‘s business idea? I din’t get it.
Who is more handsome, in your opinion? Tae-Moo or Sung-Hoon or the chef, Hari’s friend (don’t remember the name)? Tae-Moo is God! When he would look at Hari with a very tender look in his eyes, I imagined that he was looking at me. If a man of such celestial beauty gave me a look like this, I would be ready to die a happy person. But the other two characters were also extremely handsome. Never saw such concentration of male beauty in any show before.
that would have made so much sense considering all the scenes of him watching dramas lmao
Well now I’m mad we didn’t get this
Omg, yes! Such behavior would fit "drama in drama" perfect! Like leads had the same line as characters of drama he watched... 

I was sad they didn't show healthy grandpa in the end.
What I got from the hospital scenes is that even though grandpa tries to not like hari he can't, they have many similarities. Also it's to mirror grandpa with young seo's dad which tricked her into thinking that he likes his bf but actually didn't. But I wished they put the unreasonable chaebol play, that would be funny for the viewer and still use the going to the USA as the obstacle to the main couple
The WEBTOON actually spoiled the drama for me. I decided to pick it up while watching the drama and I have to say, the webtoon was heaps better in terms of plot. The drama made some changes that didn’t make sense or just wasn’t as nice
This would have been much more in keeping with the tone of the show. Especially, if they all ending up resolving everything at the chicken shop because grandpa did say he wanted to sit down to enjoy chicken with his in-laws.
You took the words out of my mouth. The timeskip didn't help, and neither did Grandpa's sudden health issue that went nowhere. I'd have liked to see Grandpa and Ha-ri bonding over karaoke... c'mon, she sang up a storm in ep 1 and surely he would have enjoyed jazzing it up with her! And we could have Tae-moo on the sidelines, jaw dropping, and then being roped in to sing or play the piano, lmao.

I also wanted more bromance between Sec Cha and Tae-moo, and a closer look at Sec Cha's background and how they grew to be such best buds. We saw a lot of that for Ha-ri and Young-seo, which was great, but the boys' side was a bit lacking.

Overall I enjoyed the drama though, the actors have some good chemistry, and the OST has been on loop for me!
Agreed. The timeskip was weird and unnecessary! They could have shown grandpa getting along with Shin Hari and their family instead. And a double wedding would've been great!
Damn you wrote the review I wanted to make word for word.

I liked that it was only 12 ep at first since the pacing of the show was so good. But they just crammed the content of the usual last 3 episodes into the last one lol.
Same. Felt like they kinda just didn’t know how to end it and in Kdramas when you don’t know what to do you throw in a time skip
I waited for double wedding too... Give second leads fast paced romance and then just left them engaged for year? Why?
Started off great and funny in the first 6 episodes, but I slowly lost interest.
Yo!! I will study with you. Seriously.
Where did you get the director’s cut from?
[deleted]
I was also really disappointed with the ending. Like >!Grandpa’s disapproval felt so out of character for him especially since he was so accepting of Guem-Hi.!<
It’s a strange phenomenon for sure. 

I know Sejeong mentioned somewhere that the filming was challenging due to COVID so I’m wondering if they had some health and safety issues near the end that resulted in the grandfather being unavailable/everyone being apart at the end, but that’s just my assumption. 

It’s especially strange since this webtoon was fully written by the time the show was being created, so it’s not as if they didn’t already have a satisfactory ending that people enjoyed.
My theory is that they had budget or scheduling problems. So much of the last three episodes was shot in the same location (the hospital), and they had minimal cast/extras. Then everything else (both proposals) happened on random street locations.
It could be budget and scheduling problems especially because of covid but it's also due to the way that dramas are filmed. Unless it's 'preproduced' ie. written and filmed in it's entirety before airing, they will start production with scripts unfinished. Apparently they will fine tune some things based on audience reaction as well as other constraints like going over budget. It's the reason why quality is usually higher at the beginning and falls off as they go. The poor creative people are rushing to stay ahead of the filming schedule, often by only a week or two. 

It happens in productions from other countries too but they are not usually as tightly plotted for a one season beginning, middle and end story. It's really a shame. Must be a blood pressure and potential heart attack nightmare for everyone concerned. And not the best for us audience members either. 

It's worth remembering, though. When a drama really nails the second half and the ending, it's a major, major accomplishment.
I only recently learned that many dramas are written and shot as they go along (i.e., the entire drama is not planned out, scripted, and shot before airing). As such, I think there is maybe a risk of the whims and pressures of the studio who may have promised more money and episodes, but for whatever reason decides to wrap it up short?

Maybe others with more knowledge can confirm.
felt like they just slap those >!Marriage proposal!< here and there. No proper build up, making it felt bland and less impactful
Yeah, I got to the end of ep 12 and was shocked there wasn't more. I was expecting more scenes showing Hari and grandpa getting along, how the workplace treats Hari after some more time, more stuff on the side couple as well...
Me too. It got a lot less interesting as the series progressed. Then couldn’t maintain the momentum.
I know this is a late comment but I just watched the show and I definitely agree. The first half of the show was much stronger and more engaging than the second half .
Something like lee dong wook and Yoo in-na did with Touch your heart. The guardian 2nd couple was a bomb and i wanted to see more of them and got my wish!
They are absolutely deserving of main lead roles.
Their chemistry is off the charts. I can’t help smiling every time I watch them interact!!
AGREE! their chemistry is better than ML and FL. heck, I'd say that sejong and In-ah chemistry have better chemistry than sejong and hyo seop
They're in the same league as the Goblin second lead couple in my opinion. And just like the Goblin pair did, they also deserve their own show
Agreed. I have only ever seen Seol In Ah in two other series - Mr Queen (antagonist, although she was good it wasn’t a fun role) and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon (too insignificant a role to be impactful) but in this show, she really shone. I loved how direct and forward her character was in showing affection. It’s a refreshing and a great contrast to Kim Min-Gyu’s character.
My goshness! I wholeheartedly agree on this. Please heavens above, make this a reality.
Sign me up, they deserve they own show!
The OST is fantastic. 'Melting' occurred in Episode 4 when Taemu's heart was melting, and Move Maybe in Episode 5 when Taemu forgave Hari. Maybe he was in love, but he needed a business trip to US to figure out.
I agree, there was so much fun chemistry with geum-hui that went missing in the second half. Everything really fell flat.
>The actual romance fell flat for me though. I read this somewhere in a reddit comment and I agree 100% - taemoo had much, much better chemistry with Geum-hi than he did with Ha-ri. The main romantic pairing fell apart for me pretty much the moment Ha-ri's cover was blown. Unpopular opinion here, but I never liked the second couple. The guy was just so boring. He had like 3 facial expressions, and idk, never saw the chemistry there on his end.

Sorry for the late reply, I just watched the show but I 100% agree. I feel like the show started to lose steam once her cover was blown too. And I understand what you mean by Taemoo having better chemistry with Geumhi than Hari.
I agree.  It was such more fun
>We never got an answer whether or not Grandpa has accepted her

He has accepted her.when Tae Moo asks Ha Ri for her approval of marriage while showing the rings, He says that 'his grand father did not want him to come home, till ha ri takes the ring'.
I think 12 was right,  but they needed to remove a number of filler scenes. I didn't really care about the co-workers' romance. Nor did they need to insert Grandpa's last-minute health problem - could have just focused on Grandpa and Ha-ri getting along. Drop the time skip, reduce screentime for Min-woo and his annoying gf, and they could have had time for a little wedding and post-marriage montage.
I would also like to see Hatae in their workplace environment! The last episode seems to suggest Hari was promoted to the second place in their team. She well deserved it, but better if she went further, aligning with the growth of the company.
I have yet to watch the last 2 episodes. And the last 4 of 39.
I'd say it's worth finishing but it won't be as good as it was in the first few episodes. There are still some fun moments here and there. For instance ep 10 is a really fun episode where both couples hangout together. However the best of the show was in EP. 1-6
Here with the very same issue... just started episode 9 and I am losing interest as quickly as I gained it???
Thanks for this it was a hilarious read and the ending we all deserved!
This writer is brilliant. 😂😂😂
💕💕💕
This was amazing, thank you so much for sharing it!
That's not true at all, but I wish! They are releasing a Blu-ray (extra bts, deleted scenes, etc.) at some point, which should be the last of the ABP content, unless a season 2 is ever decided. 

Sadly, we just have 12 eps and loads of bts to reminisce over haha. At least The Swoon is making an effort and releasing some type of ABP content every couple days haha (seriously, check out their IG reels!!)
>The entire hospital situation/disapproving grandpa were plots that were not needed.

The part Hari taking care of Grandpa could stay, but no more than that. 

Double dates would be lovely. I really enjoyed Episode 10 when the four were together!
This is my second kdrama (first was miracle in prison cell #7). What are some other tier 1s you recommend?
From what I read from various interviews and statements, they may have ran into production/covid issues late and the extra scenes that were filmed were cut. 

Also, SBS probably didn't have much faith in the show initially, hence ordering 12eps. Their previous Mon-Tues shows didn't fare so well either, so ABP's success seemed to come as a big surprise (which is well deserved imo).
I may be in the minority but I actually feel 12 eps was good for this drama. Most of the situations were resolved in good time and nothing felt seriously draggy (minus the last two eps). The humour was fun, pacing was decent and storytelling fairly compact. If this had been 16, I feel the fun identity switch would have outstayed its welcome and there would be more misunderstandings and even more filler, etc. I certainly would not have wanted Tae-moo to take forever to realise his feelings, or discover he was being duped like 8 episodes later.

They could have fixed the abrupt ending by removing half the filler that was Min-woo and his annoying gf, trimmed scenes of Ha-ri's co-workers (who I felt were kind of redundant), and done away with the Grandpa disapproval plot (make him just pretend to disapprove a la drama style but secretly get along with Ha-ri, just to tease Tae-moo!). And all these did not need to be bumped into the last two episodes, a few nip and tucks along the way and this would have ended really well within 12 eps.

Japanese dramas have told perfectly good stories within a more compact time frame, so it can be done.
You are not alone, i also agree with all of your points
I'm watching Snowdrop now and just at Episode 5. But the Kim Minkyu in Snowdrop is nothing like the KMK in BP!  I always felt his acting was a little stiff, but he came through in BP and now I see a completely different character in SD.  And that's called Acting. 

I loved all the leads and can't take my eyes of of AHS.
"YOU KNOW I HAVE NO CHINGU!"

Such a memetastic line, hahahaha
>I'm currently rewatching this with friends and I'm still enjoying it.

Yes, still rewatching and enjoying.
Well said! Me toooooo!!!
Being an avid fan of the webtoon and having watched several of their works, I was honestly very impressed by KMG’s acting! I felt he brought out the gentle yet meticulous persona of Secretary Cha really well. I wouldn’t imagine Secretary Cha to be very different from how he had portrayed it.
Yes, I agree the trip was really weird and unnecessary.
Yes Mr. Gye is great fun to watch, every time he was on.
Uncanny Counter is fantastic! I too watched it between the week of ep8 and ep9 because of Sejeong. She plays a complete different character which shows her range as an actress! 

Wished the planned/announced season 2 for Uncanny Counter will come out soon, but it's not looking likely so far.. And I agree, it's a shame covid and production issues hampered the already great ABP.
The nun was just a mother figure, not an actual biological mother. He was then adopted by Chairman Kang, hence Taemoo and him grew up as brothers. 

That's why it was very touching when Seonghun finally called Chairman Kang, grandfather, when they went fishing in ep12. He never really referred to him (or Taemoo) as family.
Where can I read the webtoon :) link pls If you can. 😍
IMO, what should've happen was Grandpa was actually faking it. Then after Hari left the hospital, Taemoo convinces him again to approve their relationship and he finally gives in.

Then setup for a quick meeting for granda and Hari's parents.  Then after that, a quick bonding montage again of Hari and Grandpa.

As for Young Seo's dad, I don't mind if he didn't show up again. I see Young Seo's decision to resign is also telling his dad that she's permanently cutting him off. 

Then the preparation then the double wedding itself
Not them bonding over karaoke but like the grandpa wished early "I'd like to eat at a simple restaurant with my in-laws".
Love your ideas.

The Kang family musical scene would be fun.

Tae-moo & Sung-hoon childhood story would be interesting.
Yes, or if not a wedding then at least a strong resolution on both father/grandfather figures. 

I felt like the second lead couple got majorly short changed in this department.
Fast paced romance = the initial attraction is too much, the spark too bright 



Being engaged for a year plus = they’re adults, can take their time and not jumping into things like marriage (and what is marriage if not just another labe?)

I think that's fake news
I genuinely wondered if Covid was a reason. Felt like a lot of performers caught Covid around that time and won’t be surprised if it had affected people behind the scenes too. I wonder if they might potentially acted out of caution and/or they were dealing with staff absence and therefore have to limit the number of group scenes and also move a lot to outdoor sets.
Thanks for correct me! It totally slipped my mind. I am glad we got some sort of closure on that one.
Thank you!
I ended up watching the entire series for the sake of completion.. It was ok overall but honestly, the first half was waaay stronger than the second half. By the time the last episode rolled around, I was glad to be done with the series.
There are some articles confirming that SBS will release the remaining 4 episodes though. 🤔

And if they're officially releasing a bluray, i will 100% buy it. There hasn't been a drama that made me feel this way in a long time

And thank you for mentioning the swoon, i nedd more ABP content lmao
Of course this is very subjective to my taste: My Mister, Hospital Playlist 1-2, Reply 1988, Hometown Cha Cha Cha, Crash Landing on You.
Makes sense. Now they're readying to release the extra material. I'm checking when
I think both Ahn Hyo-seop and Kim Se-jeong mentioned that Kim Min-gyu looked 90% like the webtoon Secretary Cha, so that certainly helped! I enjoyed the boys' friendship and wish we got more of that.
I just looked up ‘A Business Proposal WEBTOON’, you’ll get a bunch of suggestions for sites to read it from. They’re all pretty much the same. The one I’m reading is on a site called VinManga
Yes, Grandpa faking it just to test Tae-moo would be good too. I had thought Grandpa would have melted a bit when he heard Ha-ri came back to the hospital because she was worried Tae-moo would freak out since it was raining. That could have been the starting point of Grandpa and Ha-ri getting along. 

Second leads didn't get much development overall, imo.
This is fire.
Or have Grandpa and Ha-ri bond over dramas, that would be uber fun too. Then Tae-moo could chime in and be like, why are you watching that drama, it's the worst, and they shut him up together and laugh. So many fun scenes they could do. Sigh.
>strong resolution on both father/grandfather figures

Agreed! Grandpa would be happy to join Hari's Dad at the chicken restaurant chatting on Geumhee, and he can have a meeting with Youngseo's dad regarding his second grandson. 

Chairman Grandpa had much do, but was unfortunately 'sent' to US for a long year.
Maybe you are right, it was just logical continuation :)
I made it to episode 11 and I can't do it anymore. 😅
It's like 400$ and only sold within Korea iirc (also no eng subs). So hopefully some of it gets uploaded online with subs haha. 

I do want to get the OST soundtrack if possible tho lol
Thnxxx 💖
Surely so much fun missed in the end. Where Hari is, the bond will there be. 

BTW, in your plan, Taemu would finally know where the name Geumhee came from. That is fun.
As the great Ahn Hyo Seop said, and I paraphrase, The series may have ended but the story of Taemu and Hari continues on. In my mind at least, ALL these fun stuffs happened (or will happen), just not within the confine of 12 episodes (sigh)
I hear you.. It took me forever to finish the second half of the series. Even if you drop the show now, you won’t miss much.
Okay nevermind damn lol.... I agree the OST is beautiful
Cue Tae-moo mock outrage and into archaeopteryx mode, and Sec Cha snorting in the background.
