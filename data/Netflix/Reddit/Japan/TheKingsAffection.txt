Can we also appreciate Hyun, Soeun and Hakyung for being non-toxic second leads? 

Hyun never resented Jiun for being Hwi's choice. He never begged Hwi to choose him instead. But he's content to stay by her side, heartbroken, as long as she's happy.

Soeun could've held on despite knowing that that Jiun loves another. But she >!let him go.!< It'll be harder to find a husband after >!two (almost) failed!< engagements. She's already been cast away after being dropped as Crown Princess, and Jiun was her only hope. 

Also, imagine the heartbreak knowing that the one you love and the one you didn't have a thing for each other. She didn't go down the classic SFL-hates-FL road. Soeun is a character I never expected to grow on me, but she did.

And Hakyung, oh our dear Hakyung. She took it all like a boss. A true Queen indeed. I'm grateful she had more depth than being a bubbly girl who was in love with the idea of CP. She has proven to be much more than she let on, and I wish nothing but the best for her.
Also I just need to say, lol at Hyun >!being 0 for 2 when Hwi/Dami asks him to safely escort people from the palace.!<
I told y’all last week and I’m right. The poster is foreshadowing Dam-Yi turning into the sun baby from Teletubbies. 

I’ll accept all apologies now from those who doubted my theory.
#Ep20: The Second Lead >!who lived and even became King!<

YEAYYYYY!!! 

This was such fun, participating in the discussions here. 🤩🤩🤩🤩

Some edits on the overall thoughts on the most beautiful saguek (casting is just too good looking):

1. >!Ji-Un still can’t catch fish!< 

2. The rabbit was really there!! - u/Tough-Leadership6412 is truly clairvoyant. 🙊

3. >!Nobody knows what happened to the red shoes and ring; the poster is misleading after all, but I am glad the ring owner didn’t die.!< 

4. >!We should have a spin-off for Eun-Seo / Ga-On- did anyone else wonder why he is still staying at yeongji’s house?!< 🤣

5.>!I low key wanted to know why papa jung did what he did by aligning with evil grandpa!<

6.Hwi’s hairstylist really got away with it all - He/she is living ***the*** life. 

7.>!The little red dots on Hwi’s face in her dream had me thinking the worst had happened to her; That catfishing ruse! But there was a lot of happy Hakyung vibes with Hwi running along the palace excitedly, so all is forgiven.!< 🤣

8. >!Hyun eating sweets by himself upon the hilltop - sigh. Perhaps would have been good to provide him with a worthy partner, but can’t ask for much more, given that TKA has spared him from almost certain death as a second lead.!<
I don't care about the flaws anymore, I love everything about The King's Affection. Looking back, I didn't really think I would love it this much. I'm so happy we got 20 episodes instead of 16.


As for Ep 20:


- Lord Sangheon looked like he was struggling as he and prince wonsan marched into the palace. GET MY MAN HIS WHEEL CHAIR!!!


- I did not expect that arrow >!would come from the queen dowager! absolutely loved that scene! i really thought it would be gaon/eunseo!<


- The life span of >!dam-i's brothers are shorter than Gaon/Eunseo's lines!<


- Bae Soo Bin ate that scene!!! Give my man a baeksang award! Mf >!really looked like he was dying and i was ugly crying!< rowoon mustve been in so much pressure doing that scene with him.


- "Accompany me to the afterlife, >!Grandfather." The creepy little smirk on hwi's face and the terrified realization in granpapi's eyes made me scream. I swear, every scene between PEB and granpapi is brilliant!<


- Lord Sangheon, the gaslighter master of the Joseon era.


- Eunuch is me during a swordfight. I'll probably just fall down and cry. lol.


- Dam-i u lil shit. Just for once ask hyun if he's okay 😂


- I didn't expect to see Gaon living with the siblings lmao. I thought it was jiun at first.


- YASSSSS! WE GOT WHAT WE HOPED FOR! >!Hyun is alive and he is king! What a great achievement for the nice SMLs in a sageuk drama!<


- The chemistry between PEB and rowoon is insane!!! Love the sweet scenes between them! PEB is brilliant while rowoon improved so much!


- I wonder if hakyung is still in love with hwi or she just geniunely wishes her well.


I have so many questions left >!What happened to prince wonsan and how the hell did hwi survive that poison!< but again, i dont care anymore. I'm just happy with the way things ended.


Thank you, Yeonmo Nation!
Thank you, Cast and Crew!


The King's Affection is now my favorite sageuk drama next to Tale of Nokdu. Yes, I love me some gender-bender sageuks lol. give us more!!!!
THE FINALE IS HERE.

A couple of thoughts.

>!Why does Hwi keep entrusting her people to Hyun to protect and escort? Boy's really sweet but he's so useless in a fight?! She should've gotten the hint when he lost Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong to her granddaddy.!<

>!Really love how Hwi held her own in the fights and took down so many men. Her asking Ji-un to buy her a pin is practically her proposing to him as well, since hairpins are for married women. Also, I will never get tired of her initiating the kissing!!<

>!Hwi's alternate universe dream was so heartbreaking, because of how easily it could have gone down that road if they hadn't been so superstitious about royal twins :( !<

>!Don't get me wrong, I'm all for happy endings and I'm glad they didn't give us all that suffering for nothing, but how the heck did Hwi manage to survive from ingesting sonangcho?? It wasn't explained at all and this really bothered me. I wish they'd just thrown us a bone and told us that Ji-un had discovered an herb that would counter the poison or sth. Her survival just seemed too convenient, especially since drama queen granddaddy just died on the spot.!<

>!All the ministers getting down on their knees to beg King Hyun for mercy for Hwi had me cracking up because c'mon, the boy's in love with her and he was complicit in hiding her secret too. He definitely wasn't going to be harsh on her - though, to be fair, they didn't know it.!<

>!Last scene on the beach was just so satisfyingggggg ajdbaoakshw9kq especially when Hyun, Court Lady Kim, Bok-dong and Eun-seo showed up. Hyun and Ji-un even shared a brotherly half-hug which shows no hard feelings and I'm so glad this love triangle resolved itself so maturely.!<

The last 15 minutes were >!satisfying as heck and made all the suffering worth it!<. I still think that this would do better as a 16-episode drama but it's still been one that I've enjoyed watching. Will miss coming back to this sub and reading hilarious recaps from you guys about granddaddy gnomes and their flying slaps.
First of all, I'm so gonna miss running to this sub after every episode to share my thoughts and discuss stuff with you guys. This is my first time to follow a drama's discussion posts since im used to just lurking around here.


What I want to see in Ep 19 & 20:

- LORD SANGHEON'S DOWNFALL! He better bleed and crumble. Idk about u guys, but there will be no room for forgiveness here.
- A well-deserved apology from Jung Daddy to Dam-i. I know its unlikely because his apology will just probably be in a form of a sacrifice, but I really wish Dam-i gets a sincere verbal apology from the suckers who made her life a living hell.
- Hwi and Eunseo working together!!!
- More Eunseo and Youngji scenes!!!!
- Jiun and dam-i living that homechacha life by the seashore (sageuk edition) >!maybe tale of nokdu too?!<
- Another warm interaction between Dami and lilbro please?
- Bokdong and Lady Kim living ordinary lives while still being there for dam-i bcs ya know what vin dieasel said . . . Family.
- Redemption arc that doesn't involve death or sacrifice ( EXCEPT YOU, LORD SANGHEON )
- King Hyunnnn or maybe Gyeom? lol
- Happy hakyung! Girlie deserves to be happy after all her heartaches.
- And of course, I just want to see Hyun alive until the very end. Bonus if he gets some cute scene with Hakyung. (Lowkey rooting for them lol)
Grandma Queen is kinda cool when >!she shot an arrow! I always liked how she seemed very powerful and influential even without being regent, and also, she’s so fitting for the role. I am curious on her treason story though.!<

HYUN, SO LOYAL!! All that’s missing is a queen for him.

I absolutely loved that >!they are alive at the end, I love how Dam-i found her true family!< ❤️
>!The dream was so sad! How I wanted her to have that life of the cherished princess. Look at her all bright and cheerful for once. And then for her surrogate family to get Infinity snapped away...!<

>!I love the ending. She gets to live her life as a woman with her man by her side, Ji-woon does not have to deal with palace life again (his father was right he can't stand a chance in the palace). It's too bad that with all the talk in the show how it's not fair the way women are treated, they ended with the message that she can't stand on the throne because she is a woman. Or that Sang-heon said it's too bad she wasn't male because he likes her. !<

>!She would be a great ruler. But after enduring palace life for so long just so she can survive, it's best for her to live a calmer, simpler life, where she doesn't have to be on guard all the time.!<

A+ for the show for displaying such a tight bond between the main couple. He learned to fight well because of her comment as a kid, >!which allowed him to protect her through to the end. I swooned at all their moments together in the last episodes.!<
**Episode 20**

Hyun’s like >!dafuq are you begging me for? Ofcourse imma keep my girl alive!!< 

Hehe. All in all the last few episodes of this show were all over the place but y’know what? All da pretty people survived and looked hella cool whilst bleeding and recovering magically. Plus >!beach reunions!< are always pretty!
This drama has been such an excellent surprise this year. PEB is amazing in it and kudos to Rowoon too.
>!Jaeun didn't die and became a King! Thank you for being alive.!<

That's all that matters to me. I can go forth and be merry.
I'm extremely relieved they >!saved Court Lady Kim from that noose!<.
>! They ended it on a happy note! Idc about anything else, really. I'm just so glad I won't be sleeping with a heavy heart tonight. 😂 !<
Ep 20 proved to me that no matter how cool Lee Hwi looks while practicing archery, I'd choose >!Yeon Seon swinging a bow and arrow over that any day.!<

I also felt way more chemistry between PEB and RW in those >!final moments!< than in the whole of TKA. Maybe it's the change of scenery. They were so, so cute. I'm happy we got >!more smiles and kisses and that the main cast stayed alive.!<

And yes, >!Hwi is finally happy. See how wide her smiles were?!< There's nothing more satisfying than that.

In the final scene, when the camera zoomed out, >!it was really noticeable how tall Jiun was. He was legit towering over her lol.!< But the height difference adds to their appeal, and they've completely stolen my heart.

Now it's time to move on. I'd just have to rewatch the episode, refresh this reddit thread, wait for subbed BTS and browse through other sageuks to see if there'd be anyone that will catch my attention. For me, TKA would be hard to beat, not because it's better than other shows, but because it brought me out of my drama slump and made me so invested in the characters. It's been such a crazy journey, and I'm so glad I stayed till the end.
Episode 20: FINALE 🇰🇷


Ahhhhh... I didn't want this day to come.

• >!The dream sequence HAD ME GOING for a minute there 🙄😂🥺!<

• >!RIP GYEOM & COMMANDER JUNG!< 💔

• >!I was shaking when court lady Kim tried to take her life. Omfggggg!<

• >!KING Hyun!< looking real zaddy-ish

• >!How all the court officials backed her up had me sobbing. How you treat people will come back to you tenfold, bravo Dami 👏🏽!<

• >!I needed at least 20-30 min of just happiness for the main couple, how y'all gonna cut it down to 15 🙄!<

• >!I still think evil grandpa should've died in a more painful way. SO LONG SUCKA!<

•>! Their happiness in the end made this show so worth it. Truly hoped it would end this way. 😭😭 my babies 🤍!<


Park Eun Bin is a WHOLE LEGEND OUT IN THESE STREETS. >!From being fearless when she saved the gang in the last episode, to the heartbreak when she seen her brother dead, to the way she killed her grandpa and that grin of satisfaction!!< The RANGE 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

And Rowoon 🥰 If "I understood the assignment" was a person! His beautiful eyes had me this whole series and made me a huge fan of his! 

Wow what a ride. Thankful for this journey! TKA was my first sageuk drama and idk how another one will top it. I watched the crown clown while waiting for new episodes and I enjoyed that one as well. The actors did an amazing job and I will definitely be watching their previous and upcoming dramas. So so good!!! I wanna rewatch from the start lol it's been fun reading everyone's comments and watching along side all of you.
That ending was so heartwarming, such great scenery. I had to fight back a few tears. What a great ride this drama has been. I love when I start this drama that with no real expectations only to be blown away.  This week's gonna be brutal since happiness ended, now this and later this week it's the end of jirisan I believe.
Some shows have endings that just destroy everything, but this ending made this kdrama go from 7 to a 9. This is how you do the ending!

Also, i love, no, i LOVE the amount of Nam Yoonsu i got to see in the last episodes. AMAZING. FABULOUS. 10 out of 10.
**Episode 20**

Though >!a happy ending was achieved, this episode was not very logically sound.!<

How in the world did >!Hwi (or rather Yeon-seon now) survive being poisoned??? They didn't even try to explain it lmao. !<

The wounds were so unrealistic. >!Both Hyun and Ji-woon got slashed multiple times yet recover in like five seconds.!<

However >!cute!< the ending was, how she managed to >!survive still confused me and took me out of the story completely. I wished they tried to explain it even a little by introducing an antidote or literally any reason as to why she did not die.!<

Also, >!KING HYUN! Poor Gyeom though. I wish he didn't have to die.!<

The >!reunion at the end!< was quite nice though I couldn't help thinking that So-eun and Ha-kyung were being left out (even though it would make no sense if they were there and would only make things more awkward).

Overall, TKA was, in my opinion, a good show. It's not perfect but it managed to make me very invested with its fantastic acting and emotional writing. Park Eun-bin better get nominated for a Baeksang next year. I shall now be suffering from TKA withdrawal for the next two weeks.
Non-humourous saeguk dramas can hugely impact your blood pressure levels. 

However, you have to admit each character was written quite brilliantly. I thoroughly enjoyed each character arc for sure. 

Major shout-out to heolma-mama she was one unflinchingly badass grandmother 🙌

Thank you **RoWoon** and **Park Eun Bin**. Your chemistry was palpable on screen and off screen.
Thank you Nam Yoon Su. Can't wait to see you in leading roles!
Dam did I really see hwi >! Dual blading for a sec?? Lol !<
My Mondays and Tuesdays won’t be the same… It’s been a great 2 months! ❤️
It's so funny to me that everytime someone has to find out Dami is a girl >!she just goes ahead and shows her boobs. Like who thought that was a good idea? What if it was just a man with boobs? Man boobs are a thing you know.!<
Episode 19:

1. So glad >!hyun is alive!<


2. >! Eun soo looks good in his new uniform 😉 !<


3. >! Lord Wonsan needs to die first in the next episode 😂 sangheon's ultimate asskisser!<


.... something is off here. I knew that something else was coming lmaooo MY POOR MAIN LEADS. Especially dealing with her evil gnome grandpa you gotta be 2 steps ahead. 


Tbh I liked this episode, finally things are turning a corner. Can't wait for tomorrow! So sad I don't want this series to end lol

Now the preview for the next episode 😱😱

>! Don't do it court lady Kim! 😢😢 omggggg! !<

>! IF YOURE TELLING ME HWI/DAMI dies in the last episode I WILL LOSE MY SHIT COMPLETELY. All that for no happy ending???!!! KBS gonna catch these hands loooooollllll!<
This show was very fun to watch if a bit draggy at times. Hyun really endured the most emotionally and physically. I’m so happy they didn’t >!kill him!<. It’s so sad that they >!killed her little brother tho…that little boy didn’t deserve that.!<
Wonsan was honestly the worst character. His face really annoyed me. It’s really wild cause the actor is actually really handsome. Gaon was my favorite side character. He was just always fighting, brooding, and being handsome which never went unappreciated lol Tiny Hwi was both adorable and badass. I thought the actor really pulled off her role. I really enjoyed the show fit what it was. It’s probably not in my top 5 but it’s worth watching imo!

Anyway, it’s been fun watching with everyone!

Edit: I just want to add that all the fight scenes were so fun to watch. It’s why I just adore sagueks. I also want to add that Hwi >!Poisoning herself along with the evil grandpa!< made so much sense to me. I loved it tho I definitely did not expect it. >!Her running in tiny as a princes in the dream sequence was so cute…it made me so sad for her.!<
- Hyun >!didn’t die and became king!!<

- Eun Seo looks better with his hair down. Miss his fringe in this episode. 

- Love the final scene. It’s like >!popping by a friend’s place to see how they are doing. !<

That’s all that matters.
just wanted to say KING HYUNNNNN
The ending aaaahhh!! my cold, lonely heart is happy and satisfied for them. ♥️🥺 i just so love that Jiun was such a soft baby in the relationship. >!Him trying to catch the bunny cutely while dami was using bow. Then later on, she pulled him in for kiss? i fucking love this dynamic hahah!<
In an Esquire interview, when asked where she'd like to travel to, PEB said, "I just want to sit by the sea and listen to the sound of waves. This is what I felt when I was shooting the final episode of TKA. Because Hwi really wanted to go to the sea."

If everything else failed to convince me of a happy ending, this did. I just hope that for once, TKA didn't put the whole ep 20 plot in the preview and there would be happy surprises for us tomorrow.
Although this drama wasn't perfect, it still ended on a high note. We all got the happy ending we wanted! Also thank goodness we didn't lost anymore characters from Dami's side, >!except for Gyeom. Why did that innocent boy have to die?😭!<

I got so emotional when they played Rowoon's OST towards the end. Damn I'm really gonna miss this show😭😭😭😭 and reading everyone's comments religiously.

I'll be looking out for future projects of Eun Bin, Byung Chan, and Yoon Su. And to my fellow Rowoon fans, I hope to see you [TOMORROW] (https://mydramalist.com/695963-tomorrow)
Omg! I’m crying. This has been the best drama this year. Loved every moment of it - the writing, the acting, perfect ending in my book!
**Post Finale Thoughts:**

• I feel so relieved. Just seeing Hyun >!alive, and on the throne!<, and seeing our main couple >!Alive and healthy makes me so happy!<

• can we talk about the scene after Hwi >!drank the poison!<, and we all believed he was >!dead!< for a solid five minutes? That dream sequence was INCREDIBLE, and really fitting, too. I totally would’ve believed that they’d spend the last 20 minutes showing an >!alternate reality where Dam-i never died!<, because seriously, that was really well done. 

• seeing scumbags wonsan and sangheon >!finally die!< was great too. I just wish Ji-un’s >!dad made it out alive too. Although, his death made a lot of sense. He was bound to die anyways for his crimes!<

All in all, one of my favourite shows of the year. Well done, barely any dragging, consistent and interesting plot, great acting, chemistry, and overall plot. I loved it.
Welcome to our very last discussion thread for **The King's Affection**. It has been a wild ride with so many ups and downs for our cute couple that I cannot wait to see them get their happy ending. We are getting a happy ending, right? RIGHT!? I just want to see everyone single of them alive and well by the end of this show (sans Daddy Jung and Evil Grandpa). I want to see more Young Ji and Ga On. I want to see our lady king in woman's clothing one more time. I want to see our OTP spend time together as they once were when things were so much simpler. So many wishes that I can't possibly list them all out here. Thank you so very much for participating in these discussions. It has been such a blast hosting and reading all of your comments. And with that, enjoy and have fun discussing!
#Ep19 : The >!boobies (reveal) strike back!< 

I mean, maybe just letting down the hair would have been good enough to show that >!she’s a gurl?!< 🤷‍♀️

For once I am relieved that >!the preview was misleading and Hyun didn’t die.(yayyyy) While it is great that TKA Is not guilty of SL cruelty, I find it somewhat hilarious that someone who’s sliced left right and centre and bleeding profusely from the mouth can be up and walking around like nothing happened after a few days (like Ga-on mysteriously healing from being nearly axed down to taking down the entire team of baddies in a few days). These good looking people are literally walking miracles.!< 🙊🙊🙊

Ngl, for me I felt ep19 is >!quite poorly written, so much so that it felt like it was done in a rush by an entirely different person. The characters and story flow became somewhat contrived and the bad guys were suddenly strung up in a neat swoop.This is possibly my least liked episode in TKA, sans the saving grace that they spared Hyun from the blade.!<

Super cringey moments:

1. Ga-On >!in his new attire and Hwi complimenting him for it - Nooooo. I find his old look much better- or is it just me ???!<

2. >!Papa jung still trying to intimidate his son to fall for his ruse!< 🤷‍♀️

3. >!Gyeom telling Hwi that the throne is his and that it belongs to no one else’s.!<

4. >!Hyun getting poems from his runaway brother who apart from breaking character from killing him at the last moment, suddenly decided to send him handwritten poems that hint at his pinkie & the brain rebellion!< 

5. >!Evil grandpa breaking out of prison like the badass gnome that he is; He should fly out of his prison cell in character like he did when he flew into court to slap his evil twin!< 

6. >!The 5 mins breakup between ji-Un and so-eun!< 

I think I just recapped the whole episode as cringey. 😶
- Why didn't the >!archers just off grandpa while they are at it. !< Oh wait we have another episode to fill haha 
- DamYi marching in >!rescuing everyone !<is such a bad ass move.
Why does the main character in kdramas always reveal all their cards to the enemy?? Lol like that’s never a wise move and they always without fail say it at some point
IF >!Gyeom dies, Hyun's life expectancy rate will shoot up. We might even actually get a King Hyun by the end of ep 20!<


Also, I have a feeling that Hyun and Prince Wonsan's relationship will somehow mirror what happened to their father and uncle. When the older prince died (hyun's dad), the younger prince (not sure if this is hwi's dad or hwi's paternal grandpa) got the throne. So, I'm guessing it will be Hyun who kills Prince Wonsan to end his evil acts. And being the eldest royal boy alive, Hyun will be crowned king.


This will be a very bitter karma to Prince Wonsan of it happens lol.
I should have learnt by now not to trust Netflix previews.

Now even Prince Gyeom is taller than Hwi! How old is he? 12?

Evil grandpa should have been ~~killed~~ taken care of much before this. He had way too much time to amass an army, find new collaborators, steal money and weapons, the works. Evidence or not, he should have been killed before any of this took such a dark turn. Eun Soo would have made a good stealth killer.

Hyun isn't a very good protector is he. Everyone he is supposed 'to protect' ends up being captured, tsk tsk.

Halma mama should read up on war strategies more. Drawing an arrow while someone has a sword next to your head.. never works.
My mind is a total mess after watching ep 19 and the preview for ep 20. I have so many things that I want to say, but this is what I want to let out the most:


JUNG DADDY, YOU DUMB MF!!!!!!! >!you already had the chance to kill the mf grand-entrance obsessed Lord Sangheon, but what did you do!<


I understand why Hwi couldn't do it, but child-killer Jung Daddy can't? 



Now that I let that out... gonna let out the rest:


- The pacing is so fast for Ep 19. So fast that it became obvious how >!Hyun won't really die. He's the 2nd ML, so of course, if he really will die, the scene will be slow and there will be a dramatic build up similar to officer yoon!<

- Gyeom is so relatable. Imagine having a group project in class and you get to be assigned as the group leader even if you don't really want to. That is stressful, I tell u.

- Child dam-i/hwi looks like a young Baifern (thai actress). No wonder she looked familiar to me.


- Eunseo in that new blue uniformmm!!! 


- Ngl, I was a little stressed out when Jung Daddy told Jiun to look for a blue incense box but mf jiun proceeded to open silver and red boxes. I was yelling throughout the scene, but had to take everything back when i realized that the blue incense box was small and was inside big boxes all along. lol sorry jiun. u still a dumbass tho.


- Hakyung best girl!!!!


- Dude the confrontation between Hwi and Lord Sangheon was amazing. Their eyes. The anger and frustration in their tearful eyes!!!! 


- The second half felt so calm and peaceful. >!Everything was suspiciously convenient so I was already holding my breath, expecting for the worse. And boy, it did. Grandpapi Sangheon back with that fierce entrance again. Miss his flying slap!<


The Preview for Ep 20 😭😭😭 It didn't have subs yet and some faces were blurry, but im pretty sure >!many will die!<

Hyun, >!you can do this! Only one more episode! You have to survive one more episode, boy!!!! We're rooting for your survival! Do it for the nice 2nd ML sageuks!<
I’m glad my first instinct about the ending came true, but >!I was really scared for a while there, especially for Hyun.  Now we get the ultimate reward of having him as King.!< I wish we had an epilogue though, and see >!who became his queen, because he can’t not marry and produce an heir.  And I hope he falls for her in his own way and live happily, as Yeonseon and Jiun have.  Hmmmm maybe I’ll just write that as a fanfic.!<

What do you think happened to Wonsan? Since >!they didn’t show him being punished, could he have died from his injuries?!<

I should have known >!there would be collateral damage but Commander Jung was probably the least painful option - unless we were Jiun.  Gyeom was tragic but we were not as invested in him as in the others.  So as far as the death toll went, we were kinda lucky.!<

That scene where >!the royal court appealed for Hwi, I was really moved. I knew Hyun can’t show his obvious bias, but if he wasn’t the king he would have petitioned to be punished along with her, as he also kept the secret the longest. !<

So hold on, >!Eunseo (Gaon) and Yeongji are living in the same house? Hmmmmm 👀😉 Also, what did he give her before leaving?!<

Overall, it was a very >!satisfying happy ending.!< And the cast promoting the heck out of the drama was truly heartwarming.  Coming here to share our excitement was also a joy, I will miss this.
Okay I know this is probably the least relevant comment ever but I need to talk about Jung and Hwi’s height difference bc wow they were really showing off that cuteness in the last ep. I feel like in earlier eps when we first meet adult Hwi, she’s depicted as an icy, majestic badass. I thought she was way taller but as the episodes progressed, I found myself doubting it more and more. I’m convinced they intentionally progressively depicted her as softer, shorter and more “feminine”. Today, I noticed she’s shorter than Sangheon and Geum - was I just not paying attention in previous eps?? Just an observation anyway.

Also - Commander Jung for best character. He was a terrible person but compelling nonetheless.
>!ALL HAIL (daddy) KING HYUNNNNNNNNN!<

but ya gurl >!is so happy about the ending although I cried a whoooole lot!<

But one thing I wish they would show more is Hwi wearing more cute hanbok!!
Also Hakyung our true bi queen! Like even after the reveal she still evidently liked Hwi/Dami

Rowoon, Park Eubin were a revelation, alongside Nam Yoonsu as well
I just have one wish, please no major deaths!!
>!They really had me there at the fake-out dream sequence, making me think the worst and then they flipped the switch.!< 

>!I was crying hard when Court Lady Kim tried to off herself. She was the best stepmama a cross-dressing king could ever have. And too bad they didn't show Soeun at the end. I kinda wanted her to have a happy ending, too.!<
Ep 20: They really >!made us suffer before giving us the happy ever after!<, didn't they? Also, Hyun >!looks good in red!<.

It was >!lovely seeing the reunion by the beach.!<

I really had fun posting and sharing the excitement of each new episode with everyone here! ❤️
First off... >!Hyun lives!!! And he became King!!!!< Y'all don't know how relieved I was that this series defied my expectations. In fact this is enough for me to forgive the writers for giving us that drawn-out Ming Envoy subplot, lol.

Anyways, I've seen many fair criticisms of this series (such as pacing), but despite its flaws, I absolutely enjoyed this series. So much so, I'll probably re-watch it in its entirety before the new year.
Just came here to post this joke theory:

That dream Hwi had after >!she poisoned herself!<, wasn't really a dream. >!After drinking that poison, she was on death's door, and as a result her soul was transported to an alternate universe, one where Dam-i grew up as a Princess alongside her brother. However, crossing the streams of these two realities caused chaos in this alternate universe, and that is why everyone was Thanosed. In short, Hwi destroyed another universe, lol.!<
Finally just done with the episode. 

>!What a great send off. !<

>!I was already anticipating for a tragic ending. Glad they didn't. !<

>!\- Kinda sad no appearance from So-Eun. A bit underdeveloped, but still empowering cause she was the one who accepted the marriage and also the one to break the engagement. !<

>!\- Dam-I finally smiling. What a great smile at the end. She finally gets to live her life like what her dad wanted her and without hiding or pretending to be another person anymore. !<

>!\- That dream sequence was so heartbreaking, thing could have turned out so differently, but then again.. she would probably have got no chance of marrying Ji-un cause I thought princesses usually got married off to other countries to form alliances. !<

>!\- I'm fine with the ending actually. We could have ended with either: Good ending, sad ending, bad ending, WTF ending. Glad they kinda stick the landing somehow. !<

And now I patiently wait for the behind the scene video on episode 19 and 20.
Overall I’m happy with the ending! There was some draggy parts of this drama, some nonsensical side plots and a few plot holes but I’d say this was a solid above average kdrama with a really great cast and some absolutely incredible acting/scenes.

In particular, the scene when Ji-un and Hwi fall apart after saying “there’s nothing to worry about anymore” absolutely wrecked me. I don’t usually cry when watching kdramas. But the way that Hwi finally gets to truly cry from relief and the way they both collapse into each other was perfectly done.

Also the FL and ML chemistry was off the charts. 

I also want to give a shout out to the writer for showing more female intimacy dominance. One thing I loved about this drama was how engaged the FL was in the intimacy such as initiating kisses, showing actual interest in said kisses, etc. All romance dramas could benefit from this instead of the hands down, wide eyed close lipped pecks we usually get lol.
I may still be in denial but I don't think >!Hyun is gonna die  I bet the writer is doing this just to take him out the picture for a while but he'll be back at the end to help Hwi and maybe take the throne at the end!<

On the other hand I still think >!Hwi is not gonna survive this 😔 I don't see a way... but I'm still hoping for a happy ending 😣 Hwi deserves it after suffering all her life...!<

Edit: >!Yeah! They didn't kill Hyun!<
Tbh episode 19 was a little underwhelming, >!everything was happening so fast and it seemed way too easy...!<
But seriously why did they >!let the grandpa live for so long?!!! They should've kill him on the spot!<

I've seen the preview for the last episode and >!it looks so tragic ... I don't think I wanna watch it!< 😭😭😭
**Episode 19**

3/4ths of the way in I was like this is way too easy. Well I guess it was too good to be true. >!At this point and judging from the preview for next episode, I have no hope left for a happy ending. No matter what Hwi keeps saying about not dying, uhh there are somethings that are out of her control.!<

How the heck did >!Hyun manage to drag himself back to the palace?!<

Why is Hwi's preferred method of revealing her secret is to start stripping? 

Also Ha-kyung going on about how she could blackmail Hwi was hilarious. As if anyone believes she is capable of anything like that.
It’s criminal how underutilized Park Eun-hye has been used. She’s an amazing actress but she was in like 5 seconds in the first two episodes and then she disappears for like 10 episodes. I was really expecting her to have a few scenes with Ji-un’s dad so that they could show his more of his softer side and really display how his love for his family is at war with what he has to do working for ASshole Granpa.
Y’ALL HOW DID SHE SURVIVE the poison I’m bothered they didn’t explain that part
I forgot to point this out but let me just say it...

THE KING'S AFFECTION HAS THE BEST OSTs! I can't choose a favorite! All songs make my heart flutter!


Also, I just realized that Hide and Seek and Full of You are two different songs 😂 listening to these songs remind me so much of the happy and heart-fluttering scenes in the drama.
Ommmgggggg that was the most satisfying show I have ever watched. Like I feel like I ate a good ass meal.

1. Sangheon: Was the most stoic badass ever. That was exactly how you do a villain who only had one evil intention but wasn't boring AF. I felt like I was holding my breath whenever he entered a room.
2. Hwi: Damn the acting, the little inflections, EVERYTHING. She was LIFE.
3. Lady Park: Just...amazing.
4. &#x200B;
   1. Jung...let's be for real every time that poor man cried, I cried haha. I'm always like WHY YOU GOTTA DO MY MAN LIKE THAT while crying into a blanket haha.
5. Those adorable kids. Where is their Emmy?! The kids that played Jung and Hwi ripped my heart out.
6. Yo they did lil bro so dirty though....I really didn't think they were going to go there and they RIPPED MY HEART OUT. 

So quick question. I want to start watching these specific people. What other shows or movies do you like with these actors?
I’m going to sound like a twat for complaining again but this time around the episode felt rather rushed lol. Not entirely a bad thing, I honestly quite enjoyed the pace but it was just completely different from the previous episodes. The characters seem to suddenly get horribly wounded and then cue some unknown time skip then perfect skin is back. The plot armour is quite strong in this one haha

I’m not saying this because I’ve said before >!Prince Jaeun/Hyun shouldn’t die as the cliché goes!< and I want >!him to be king!<, but the transition from >!him escorting the head court and head eunuch!< to >!being cornered and fatally wounded!< was so sudden. Then instead of >!dying!< he somehow could >!drag his own body from some forest to the king’s quarters all while leaking blood everywhere!<. I wasn’t expecting a Game of Thrones amount of characters being tossed off but everything ended up being so convenient. Nobody died when >!Lord Sangheon captured the four people, and miraculously the King arrived just on time!<.

That being said, the final scene of the incoming >!coup!< was exciting. Lord Sangheon >!arrested and beheaded!< wouldn’t have been a satisfying ending so we’ll see how things turn out tomorrow.

Also the highlight for me this episode was the reveal to the Queen (regent, not dowager). Felt weird with it being a >!boobie reveal!< but the way she took it was heartwarming. The King called her >!“a precious person”!< and the Queen instead told her >!she shouldn’t have told her for her safety!<. If they end up living secret lives outside the palace they should 100% be friends/벗

Finale edit: HEHEHEHE [I CALLED IT](https://reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/ra64gu/_/hngut6w/?context=1)!! >!Long live the new King!<!! I guess they reserved the >!bloodshed!< for the finale. They handwaved how the >!King survived!< but in my headcanon it’s the >!anxiety pill acting as an antidote.!< Not sure if that makes sense at all hah. I also assume >!Prince Wonsan died off-screen. Both his and Lord Sangheon’s deaths weren’t as satisfying but it’s better than them being alive I guess.!<

I wish we had more scenes with the >!ex-Queen and So-eun, since we didn’t see So-eun at all despite her being the main cast!<. However >!her dad defending Lee Hwi and the whole court following suit!< kinda made up for it. Anyhow I really likes how they wrapped everything up and I’m glad I didn’t watch yesterday’s previews lol. Despite the wonky pacing this is one of the most well-shot drama I’ve seen in a while and the ending is very solid. Props to the TKA team!!
All wrapped up now! A satisfying enough finale. 

PEB is a Queen.

>!Because we never saw Wonsan again at the end, I thought Wonsan was going to be seen having survived in an after credits scene, setting up a sequel between Hyun and Wonsan hahaha!<

So glad I was wrong. 

Thank you everyone here for the fun weekly discussions :D
Yayy! I'm glad the ending is sweet! This was my first saeguk and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Park Eunbin and Rowoon had amazing chemistry and their scenes were fantastic. She portrayed being the King with such ease.. I can totally understand Jiun falling for her lol

On the other hand, I liked how they played the underlying lgbtq themes by not going out of their way to be dismissive. From the beginning when Jiun thought he fell for the prince, he still didn't hesitate to confess and basically accepted it. When the rumors of the relationship spread, it seemed more like court gossip about the king not having an heir than something blasphemous about seemingly 2 men together. And lastly when Soeun found out Jiun missed the king, before the identity was revealed, she was heartbroken sure but just said the heart wants what it wants.
Overall really enjoyed, and love their interviews too
Did anyone else feel this episode was super rushed? Almost anticlimactic? Maybe they're saving it for the final episode which we can probably already guess who will get redemption by sacrifice >!commander jung!< 

Also how is that >!Hyun was practically knocking on heavens door but somehow made it back to the palace by foot and carrying on with life the next day?!< 

Overall TKA is still one of my favorite dramas this year.
I love how everyone's saying it's not a perfect drama but how much we've truly enjoyed it. I personally haven't felt like this before as well. Usually I'd be so particular about plot logic, writing flow etc. I may be biased as well because I am a fan of PEB's acting, but I must say casting team really did a great job. The casts are well suited, and they performed brilliantly, from protagonists to antagonists.

I guess it's also the premise of a girl as king that's so strong to keep us going, and makes us wanna root for her. I finally understand why they said it is a somewhat tragedy - when >!Ji Un told her everything's over and how hard she cried, I can't help but think she must have felt so lonely not only her whole life, but fact that everyone has to die in order for her to survive.!< Knowing her, that's probably what she wants to avoid her whole life, despite her own situation was always risky, every single second for so many years. With PEB's extraordinary acting, carrying dual characters of tragic life background yet well respected and cherished king, I really hope she gets to win awards next year. Also very happy that she pushed other projects to choose this one. She really did very well. 

Now, I'll watch Hot Stove League VERY SLOWLY because I've watched all her other shows before TKA.. 😐
Damn netflix got all glitchy towards the end. Some of the subtitles weren’t showing. I guess I’ll have to rewatch tomorrow!

But hey at least we got a >!happy ending despite the sad losses along the way. Gyeom dying was so sad, but Hyun taking the throne was a sweet ending. We all know if anyone deserves it, it’s him!<

I’m glad Jiwoon’s dad >!got the redemption arc, even though the ending was bittersweet for him.!< As for Lord Sangheon, >!bye bitch!<

I’m going to miss our Yeonmo Squad, I can’t wait to watch their future projects!
yeah this show slapped so hard, thankyou PEB for making my first historic drama such a good one.

After following her here since her earlier dramas i'm excited for her new one in 2022 :D

also, i'm glad Chaeyeon got some decent screen time, and with DIA on a seemingly endless hiatus I hope she can get more acting roles, I like her so much
The way >!Hwi cleverly poisoned herself and her grandfather!< takes a nod to her character - smart and courageous 

The acting in this drama was top notch and this was the first one with historical twins I’ve seen. This drama will be missed!
MAN! I did NOT expect the last 2eps to be such a roller coaster ride!!! I don't know why i thought ep 19 would be the end and ep20 will be all fluff. But oh so much drama~! Ps, gonna be a lot of spoilers ahead n I'm too lazy to blacken them out so read at your discretion. Plus i suppose since I'm commenting on this late, most should've already watch it by now.

1) why are all these ppl making promises they can't keep/ have no control over. Jiun promises he'd be fine when stealing the poison from grandpa, only to get caught. Hyun promises to get gyeom to safety and protect him only to get him killed. Argh I'm like damn man 

2) if lady kim & eunuch hong could recognize jiun even with half his face covered (when he broke into grandpa's place) then why does he even have it covered in the first place? Lol

3) i wished they'd explain a bit more on how hwi could've survived even after taking the sonangcho. Is it the sweet she took? Is it because she didn't drink a lot? She coughed up blood, that means internal bleeding dude how can she survive that?

4) where is eun seo in all the fighting??? I mean why is he always late to the game? N he's supposed to be like the best swordsman. I mean what good is that if i don't see him in the frontline of the fighting?? Felt like I saw more action from grandma than from him lol. The 2nd time wonsan tried to (and successfully) kill geom i was hoping he'd jump out of nowhere and save the day but sigh just a minute too late. At least he killed wonsan. 

5) jiun's dad could throw a small knife from a far to kill the man who held his wife captive but he couldn't kill grandpa right in front of him. I mean, i get that u wanna kill him but u should do so in ur capacity? Like he's already half dead and he expects to fight multiple guards to kill grandpa? I get his anger and he's emotional but that does not help, u ended up not only not able to kill grandpa but dying instead 🤦🏻‍♀️ won't it be better if ppl strategise to reach their goal rather than just run straight ahead aimlessly? 

6) i really thought I was going to see Hyun get killed but never expected him to be king!! What a twist! In the end it kinda went a huge round from what wonsan wanted kinda? Also, why is he warning his brother about his treason act beforehand? Although it didn't do much good. But luckily he managed to warn hwi at least,  unlike jiun who's like, oh don't worry too much. 

7) goosebump moments: when hwi barges into grandpa's place to save lady kim, eunuch hong, jiun n jiun's dad - she was so badass!! I was like yasssss gurlllll! Another goosebump moment when she revealed to the queen that she's a girl. The queen's reaction the acting was soooo good. i esp love how she's like, why r u telling me? What if i blackmail u? Like why r u trusting me with this secret? But it's because of the respect hwi has for the queen, oh my heart. 

Of course park eun bin's acting is like chef's kiss - i really love love love her acting and the way she carried out all the different emotions. Have always been a big fan of hers and as expected, she executed this perfectly! I was also surprisingly really impressed with nam yoon soo's acting - i really fell for him hard here as a second lead - i hope i get to see a drama one day with him as Male lead. 

I started this drama without much expectations but it surprisingly stirred my heart more than i expected. ♥️
Lee Hwi: I should tell you the truth about me.  
>!\*starts undressing\* !<  
I laughed out so loud in that scene.   
\*insert Ahh... shit here we go again meme\*  
P.s >!HYUN LIVES. PLOT ARMOR FTW!!<
Y’all… I am so scared for tomorrow 😭 pls hold me
They better get a happy ending. They’ve been through so much.
Ep 19

This episode was so frustrating (but still good to me nonetheless). Like when >!Papa Jung told Ji-un to leave but he didn’t and he took so effing long to find the tiny box…oh, come on, look for it like your life depends on it because it surely does?!!<

But I get it, one scene sets up for another…

>!I’m really happy Hyun survived and I really hope that was the last time for his near death experience.!<
The director should stop playing mind games with us… 😭 

And I’m so proud of Dam-i because she is killing it every episode. What an absolute king. >!It was really nice her little bro got to tell her that the throne is rightfully hers. She deserves to hear it! And from family, too!!<

Agh! I know some people pointed out that 20 episodes was too long for this series, but to be honest, I think it’s not long enough! LOL

I really enjoy TKA and then checking Reddit after to see everyone’s thoughts and feelings. Thank you for making my Mondays and Tuesdays so enjoyable. Really sad it’s coming to an end and I wish all you other TKA fans well. I wish you all the same happiness that Dam-i and Ji-un wishes for each other! HAHAHAH

Well, one more to go! Last day of hoping that all the leads find the happiness they deserve before we find out the truth! 🥰
To anyone worried about Episode 20, >!you can watch it with ease!!<
Just watched the finale.

It's been amazing to discuss TKA every week with you guys! After watching the finale, this drama has lived up  my expectation to be one of my most favorite drama of this year.

While there are some lacking aspects — last minute trope, kind of dragging plot at the few last episodes, and *that long stares*, it still is very, very, effin good in terms of overall quality. Starting from the PEB's acting (worthy of baeksang), amazing OSTs, good cinematography, and gripping atmospheres. Even with kind-of-draggy plots, TKA has been my most anticipated on-air drama!

Not a person who usually likes a sageuk drama, but TKA hits different. My vocabularies won't do any justices here. Literally have no interest on this drama before, but when I tried it, the intro has sold me alone.

&#x200B;

>!Wondering what happens to Prince Wonsan tho lol!<
I cried. Can’t believe it’s over.
Congratulations to the cast and production team of Yeonmo for having an average viewership [rating of 12.1] (https://www.soompi.com/article/1503769wpp/the-kings-affection-ends-with-new-personal-best-in-ratings) for it's finale! I know more people will be watching this on Netflix now that it has concluded 👏👏👏
Did anyone see the pre-release clip for ep 20? It's a happy one, and they got >!married!< but I'm still not convinced that that's how TKA would end because:

1) It seemed like a dream sequence 

2) Of all parts to release in the episode, kbs released that part. It'll be an unwise move if they spoiled the ending 12 hours before the ep aired.

3) Court Lady Kim >!survived?!<

4) Jiun was wearing his scribe clothes. Like come on. As a >!groom?!<

5) Hwiwoon wished to go to the sea, right? Surely It'll be a disappointment if they never got to go, or at least, if it was naver mentioned.

6) They seemed too happy. Too, too happy. It feels off.

7) Watching the clip made me sad. I don't know why, but it did. This is one of those don't-ignore-your-gut-feeling moments.
This was such a great finale! Sageuks and beach scenes have a history of breaking my heart, but TKA reversed on my expectations right through to the last scene.

What a great few months for those of us who love historical kdrama! 

Glad we've got The Red Sleeve to get us through missing the Yeon Seon chemistry.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭lovedddddddd the ending
😭😭😭😭😭 I am going to miss this show forever. This episode felt like it was two hours long.
Haven't seen the last episode yet but I'm most curious about if PEB/Hwi's stylist will truly get away with it...you know

EDIT: the stylist did have >!5 mins!< of work this epsiode
Omg I’m just starting the final episode but this show is amazing!!! This and the red sleeve have been such incredible shows this year. If you guys haven’t started The Red sleeve yet I really recommend you do!
I might be slightly biased as a Fantasy, but Rowoon's acting in these last few episodes in particular have been incredible. Especially in the last episode where in most of his scenes he had me crying straight away. 
Great job to the whole cast as well, going to miss watching this
- Everyone got their happy ending 🥺 everything about this drama was just amazing!!! From the storyline, the acting, sword actions & great OST… Wow. 

- RoWoon singing the last OST, omg 🥲

- **COMMANDER KANG** YASSSS!!! 

- **LEE HYUN LOOKS SO DAMN GOOD AS A KING** he deserved that throne. He was the LOYAL one from the very beginning. 👏🏼

- the beach scene was beautiful!! I’m gonna miss this drama so much😭
**FINALE EPISODE THOUGHTS KYAAAA I have feelings so sorry about rambling. Don't worry, this will be my last! Since this is the finale I basically spoiled everything so move along if you haven't watched Episode 20!**

* King Hwi in warrior mode let's go!
* This Wonsan is so annoying like calm down. HOWEVER, I think this is a better big bad than Sangheon. Like I can actually see him being evil.
* >!Why is Hyun always assigned to taking care and transporting important people. I'm so tired for him it's insane.!<
* >!Oh gosh the coup is HAPPENING NOW??? That's barely 3 days since the arrest???!<
* >!The scene where Grandpa and Hwi's army come to a head in front of the royal court is Beautifully Done ™️. You know that you will not be breathing for the remaining hour.!<
   * >!OK first of all WHY IS THE KING IN THE FRONT LINES?? I'm not a war expert or anything but I do know they shouldn't be in the front row at least?!<
   * >!Wonsan I am so angry with you I can't even explain my anger with you. Your smug face is not helping.!<
   * >!GYEOM NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PRECIOUS PERSON NOOOO!!!! He did nothing!!!! Hwi crying, blaming herself for letting him back to the palace. I'm heartbroken. She has already lost two brothers.!<
   * >!That amount of blood on Wonsan's mouth is not enough I'm so angry!<
* >!This war scene is so intense, that's King Hwi sword + sheath for you! Like you know she can carry herself in a battle and if you don't she'll show you!!<
   * >!YAAAS PAPAJUNG redeem yourself! Thank you for coming to the rescue!!<
   * >!STOP wishing people well Hwi, that's textbook foreshadowing!!<
* >!Okay i have so many feelings.!<
   * >!It's so messed up the way Seok-jo thought at first that to side with evil would be what saves him but it turns on him instead. A decade ago he'd be walking away with Sangheon as an innocent victim blubbers to death, today he's the one left behind. And I guess he knew that would happen sooner or later. I don't think he was shocked with how things happened at all.!<
   * >!In a way, with this power dynamic - not that I wanna justify his crimes - sometimes people really are way too deep in a trap to change or do anything at all. Seok-jo was probably thinking as long as he helps grandpa, he could keep a protection bubble for him. When it turns out he was actually strengthening the jail that he was trapped in.!<
   * >!When he wanted to kill Sangheon before his death, it showed that no matter how much Sangheon manipulated him into thinking that Seok-jo owed him his life, Seok-jo didn't falter. He knew grandpa was evil through and through.!<
   * >!Rowoon and BSBs acting!!! BSB close to death, clutching everything to keep himself straight, Rowoon breaking down, touching his father like he would crumble at the touch of his hand. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!!! I CANNOT FANGIRL ENOUGH!!! My eyes do not deserve this top-level scene!!<
* >!I'm so heartbroken like pieces everywhere.!<
   * >! Hwi is so pure and headstrong and loves his people so much. !<
   * >!ALSO WHY ARE YOU FORESHADOWING YOUR OWN DEATH AAARGH!<
   * >!"I want to live" I'm so very sad. ACTUAL TEARS ACTUAL TEARS GODDAMMIT!<
* >!Grandpa points out that all his mistakes involve all his family members and whether they are dead or not. This guy is evil, that's established. I just don't get how he could act on it. Hwi could very much smack his head and he'd be out like a light. Literally.!<
* >!I checked my blood pressure and I think I need to take a break!<
   * >!I knew there was something in that tea!!<
   * >!Court lady kim noooooooo. Oh god I'm so stressed I'm already standing up please everyone stop killing yourselves!<
   * >!When blood spattered out of Sangheon's mouth I rejoiced!<
   * >!Then wept because OH GOD I WILL NOT ACCEPT HWI DYING NO. Absolutely not. No ma'am. I disagree. This outcome is invalid.!<
* >!The dream is too harsh. Like what would have Hwi's life been had people didn't go nuts over omens. It's so sad. This is so messed up seriously.!<
* >!When Hwi heard Jiun say she has nothing to worry about and she broke down into tears you can actually feel an entire world of burden lift up from her shoulders.!<
* >! Hyun in King's clothes? DESERVED. I can now lead a happy life. I am now at peace.!<
* >! When the Queen Dowager offered for her to run away and she didn't want to, I thought she was just being noble. But when she explained that is nothing different from how she had always lived, turns out she was just being realistic.!<
* >! I was so moved when the royal court begged for forgiveness for Hwi. She was an amazing king!!<
* >!OH NO GAON & YOUNGJI ARE ADORABLE I'd watch a mini spin-off for this.!<
* >!When I saw Hwi wearing her kyot dress while shooting an arrow and just smiling grinning laughing every 3 seconds I squealed. Yes babie you deserve happiness! Happiness looks so beautiful on you!!<
* >!\*sobs\* Hwi and Jiun are so happy and at peace and just the babie x tough couple dynamic they were made to be. They can interchange roles lol. I just feel so much for them. I'm so glad we ended up with a happy ending 🥺!<
* >!Hwi is really one of the best written role models ever.!<
   * >!She's not a great character. She hardly has any flaws. The only thing standing in her way were outside factors that she has no control over. Perhaps the only mistake she made which really isn't a mistake at all was acting on her feelings. That's literally the only thing she did that made her life harder while she was pretending. The rest were made by sucky people. (Also, it's not a mistake because if she insisted Jiun get away from the palace she'd have died in the end)!<
   * >!That said she is a great inspiration. If you're born perfect and the whole world can't come into terms with that, you're gonna do something about it, of course, making sure you don't step on others along the way.!<
* >!I still have a lot more feelings that I wanna process. This drama is a beautiful form of art that you can enjoy at first and study later. Personally think that the masterful blend of suspense, romance, comedy, and social commentary makes this drama one of my favorites. I hope everyone enjoyed their viewing experience, too!!<
this series was really sweet. i normally never watch period dramas but i watched bc of Park Eun Bin and she killed it!!!!!! So excited to see what she does in the future. I also really enjoyed Rowoon in this as well. overall a satisfying ending too.
Strap in everyone.

I believe this 2 episodes are going to be >!heartbreaking!<. 

>!I myself will not be visiting until I have watched both episodes.!< 

GLHF.
Hello TKA family, I hope you're ready for the final episodes!
**Pre-episode 19 thoughts:**

• Hyun. Ohhhh boy. I’m not ready to see him >!die, I think this might be one of the saddest tv deaths of 2021 for me if this actually happens!<

• lord sangheon, I await your downfall. 

• I’d love to see an epic fight scene with ga-on, Hwi, hyun, and Ji-un before the series ends. To think we haven’t gotten a scene with all four talented fighters 😩

• a happy ending. PLEASE.
Finally, such a satisfying ending! I am so so so giddy right now. Also, how big was Park Eunbin's smile in this episode? I am so happy for all of them! Ahh my heart!
I didnt like the fact that Hyun >!is kept alive so he can ascend the throne from Hwi instead of Gyeom instead, coz if every royal blood died, who the heck is going to take the throne and now Hyun is lonely and by himself in the palace!<
Is there anyone think that the actual villain of this whole drama is >!grandma queen!<? She knew about the truth all along and didn’t do anything and sit on the sidelines? She also knew how evil grandpa is as he helped her to be >!queen decades ago? And yet she’s still alive and no punishment whatsoever?!<
We're reaching the end! I'm so glad I binged the first 10 eps in a week so I can discuss with everyone here. Reading all the theories after has helped a lot in the wait. I felt like last week's episodes were a bit too political and tragic so hopefully this week's will be full of fluffy happy endings and some satisfying revenge/redemption.

My wishes:
* Court lady and eunuch hong to be safeJung appa to either realise evil gramps is terrible and betray him to help Ji Un and Hwi or go down with gramps
* Gramps to suffer some humiliating fate. No secret assassination or anything. Dismember his authority in front of everyone.
* Ga On + Ji Un's friend being cute and hinting at romance (can she melt his steely exterior?)
* Hyun to >!survive. PLEASE no more tragic 2ml stuff. That's all, as long as he's alive at the end I am happy.!<
* Ji Un and Hwi happily ever after, idc if it's in the palace as a female king or retire to the countryside
* Ha Kyung and Hwi be bffs after she finds out the truth.
* So Eun helps them out in some way with her intelligence and finds peace in Ji Un's romantic decisions.
* I predict Hwi's half brother to take over the throne, but if not I hope they maintain a good relationship.
Steeling myself for these last two episodes! I’m fully prepared to delete them from my brain if they’re too heartbreaking. And just, please keep the mains alive! Is that too much to ask??
Ep 19

* Hyun >!lives! For now...!< 
* No no, Gaon >!looks weird in his new apparel!<
* Jiwoon >!searching for the poison was heart-stopping and stop, my heart did!<
* I'll never get tired of the >!king strutting in like the boss she is and rescuing Jiwoon for the umpteenth time!<
* This drama takes show >!(your boobies), don't tell to a whole new level!<
* That poem? Wonsan >!had a change of heart?!<
* Of course grandpa would do a >!prison break.!< I'm getting quite fond of the silly bugger, gonna miss him after tomorrow
This has been a ride, an exhilarating one. TKA will remain in my mind for some time. PEB's killer performance (always, Song Jiwon best Kdrama character) and nearly all the supporting characters have been a joy to follow. Hwi and Jiwoon is my favourite Kdrama romance now. I hope episode 20 closes the book in a memorable way!
It has been fun discussing TKA each week with everyone here. I'm going to miss it after tomorrow. Thank you all!
>! I had a feeling that hwi was gonna pass the throne down. Although, I sort of wish she would've reigned as king for a few years, I feel like she cared about the wellbeing of her people. Also could've given prince Geom more time haha. I saw the preview for tomorrow's episode, it looks like younger brother prince dies...??!<
Wow jiwoon's father ran it down, for no particular reason. Sill happy about the ending though hahaha.
I love this show. 

By any chance does anyone know where I can listen to / get the instrumental tracks that are not on the soundtrack that's on Spotify? I will highly appreciate.
ugh i was spoiled when i checked my instagram explore, i saw >!hyun in king robe so i knew he’d be safe and hwi in her wedding attire (altho that was only a dream). i was so ready to see hyun die but thank you writers for not killing him off!!!!<

all that scheming that >!lord wonsan has done are useless lol i don’t feel sorry at all for him. thank you tho for not slashing your brother.!<

when hwi >!drink the tea laced with poison i thought she would only poison her evil grandpa but noooo she also wants to end her life 😭 glad we have physician jung as the boyfriend cause he could revive her.!< this is what they should’ve done in the first place to the evil grandpa!!!

i’m pretty satisfied with the ending. >!i command hwi for not running away but instead taking the punishment, knowing that her life would be on the line. with hyun on the throne (love seeing him as the king 😍), there’s no way he would execute her. no one is dead well except ji-woon’s dad but that’s kinda expected. i really thought they would go for the same ending with the novel but i’m glad they didn’t.!<
Is anyone who's read the manwha happy to share how the events played out differently from the show?

I know that Jiun didn't exist and Gaon was the male lead. !>Think I briefly saw that Hyun has a downer ending in the manwha<!

I tried staying away from seeing more on the manwha in case of potential spoilers for the show. But now that it's over, I'd love to know all about it!
I actually have got a cynical take for >!those who didnt enjoy!< the ending. 

>!Perhaps the final 30-mins was all but just a dream. Minus the part where Dam-I woke up. !<

>!Living by the country side was a promise that Ji-un told Dam-I after Dam-I revealed her secret. She was so in love with Ji-un so you can't blame her for dreaming about it. !<

>!Vomiting from mouth usually indicates organ damages, Ji-un murdered his way in and he was calling for help.. uhm but you just murdered everyone.. !<

>!And the royal court scene, we never know how far the corruption was gone. So many senior officers standing out for Hwi is a bit far fetch. !<

Please downvote away\~
Umm what is the punisment they gave Hwi in the end? I thought they will explain it in the end but they were babbling about boiling water and i’m confused lol…
The show ended on a happy note!! I'm so glad that Hwi/Dami's people are all around her too ❤️
That scene where she said I love you for the first time was so good 🥺
Loved everything about this show ,the background setting felt so real and lord changchun was the best villain. The ending was good but what if the people loved dam-i and didn't want her to descend from the throne. She would've been the queen ruling , it would be a big boost for women power in kdrama. Don't get me wrong lee hyun would be a great king too, but dam-i is more experienced and knows around her way ruling the palace. Maybe she had anxiety and ptsd being in the palace which would be reasonable for her to leave to be happy ,but I feel like she deserved the throne nonetheless.

Also hope that lee hyun and noh ha kyun end up together,they'd be so cute.
excited for the finale! came with no expectations and so far TKA is one of the best dramas coming out on this year.

ep 11: >!holy. fuck. !<

on a side note, PEB should be nominated for baeksang next year for her performances imo
Is it just me or is the biggest challenge in suspending disbelief the fact that Park Eun Hye plays Ro Woon’s mother? She’s technically old enough to be his mother (she’s 43, he’s 25) but she’s so fresh faced I keep getting distracted by this ruse. Given how hard it is to suspend my disbelief that so few people at the palace have figured out Hwi’s sex, this is saying something.
[deleted]
Can someone tell me why >!Hwi did not die after taking the poison!<?
Honestly, we so could've gone without the Ming episodes so this drama would've been 16 episodes ahahaha. Also, >!is Wonsan dead or what? No one confirmed his demise!<
Woah this thread is a lot more forgiving than MDL reviews and comments. I've spent only 5 mins scrolling through there and the negativity is giving me a headache.
Whoa! That was such a ride. This was also my first period drama too and never thought I would enjoy, but here I am lol. 

There are some few things I noticed from earlier episodes that seems to be really irrational(might not be the best word to describe it) to me. Must I say, a bit out-of-character.. especially about So-Eun and Ji-Un’s father.

1. So-Eun was ultimately written to be someone who is morally upright and sensible, but our first encounter with her was that she held hostage and tried to hurt Ji-Un’s female assistant while waiting for her acne medication. Like wtf was that?

2. I think her name was Il-Wol(Dam-I’s court maid friend).. what was Commander Jung’s reason for killing her? And was it actually necessary to kill her?
Wowwww what a satisfying ending 👏 👏 👏 

That whole beach scene was amazing
That was such a satisfying ending! I was really worried about how they would wrap it up but they did a nice job. It’s one of the most satisfying kdrama endings in a while for me
**EPISODE 19!!! I totally put off watching this on Monday because I need to watch the finale asap.** 

* Netflix: "Violence, suicide", Me:"...No please no"
* PEB you beautiful crying creature. This communication is beautiful. Just understanding from both sides. They really love each other \*sobs\* they've both been so lonely for the longest time.
* It's good that >!Soeun is the one breaking off the engagement. I know she was annoying at first, but I can't imagine having to break off two engagements that quickly.!< I'd be devastated and I wouldn't know how to talk to my father after all that. 
* OMG the Jung confrontation!>! Jiun is understandably heartbroken at the harsh realization that his father will never change and will continue to justify his actions as a form of protection. Jiun may be idealistic but he understands how his ideals aren't viable, but still resolves to fight for what's right anyway!<
   *  Rowoon's voice breaking while remaining calm is beautiful
   * >!That table slam I was so shocked I literally jumped!<
   * His mom looks so young I really thought she was his cousin or sister at first
* Man these lords can not use their feet while walking eh.>! OMG PAPA SEOKJO GOOD GOD SOMEONE IS BEHIND YOU STOOOOOP -- OKAY THAT WAS SWIFT GOOD LORD NOW gGRANDPA KNOWS YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING. oh grandpa teddy bear is now declaring a war.!<
* I really really really love bear hugs. It feels so safe and cute, and relaxing. For some reason, this is a better bear hug than other dramas? Doesn't feel so stiff and scripted.
* >!Oh damn I didn't expect we'll be watching the revelation this early on!!<
   * I was standing the entire time Hwi was vibing
   * That eyebrow and deadass cold stare could scare the entire nation of Joseon 
   * Her smirk good god I live for this moment yes please give me strong fighter Hwi
* When sh\*t hit the fan at the >!Jung Residence, Jung-Mama suddenly--fainted? Felt bit anticlimactic lmao, she literally went out of that scene unscathed.!<
   * Seok-jo's face when Jiun asked about >!the poison was hilarious, like "who is this b\*tch kidding he almost lost his goddamn mother and is asking for more trouble in the family? tf i threw my moral compass to the ends of the earth to protect this ingrate???"!<
   * Jiun has a point too they're all >!done anyways might as well go down and serve justice at the same time!<
* I SWEAR TO GOD DO NOT KILL HYUN I WILL LITERALLY HATE YOU ALL
   * >!GOOD FCK I DO NOT LIKE WHERE THIS FLASHBACK IS GOING!<
   * >!The hell with you, Wonsan, my hate for you lives in my head rent-free.!<
* Me watching>! Jiun sneaky-sneak!<: "I'm so nervous why am I watching this drama I did not sign up for this suspense I just wanted to see gay people sneak around in the palace"
* I literally do not understand what kind of power play does Sangheon still have? Is there a big reveal for it? Because I honestly do not get why they can't just slash him off? The writing for this character seems like it was done in silos, outside of TKA's world. Like he's the only one without vulnerability for no good reason besides being the assigned big bad?
   * >!KILL HIM PAPASEOK HE'S 100 years old please I'm sick and tired of his useless smirk!< 
   * >!Good heavens WHY didn't you just kill him now you're all screwed man I'm so angry he was like a hair strand away from killing him !<
   * >!HYUN GOOD GOD IM CRYING PLEASE OH GOD I M SO STRESSED today is Wednesday night I still have two full days of work incoming I cannot bear the hurt!<
* I feel so bad for these actors, look at the air coming out of their mouths. It must have been FREEZING. Had I been in this situation I wouldn't be able to voluntarily move a muscle 
* >!THE MINI HEART ATTACK I WAS SO SHOCKED!<
   * >!NOW WHY DID NONE OF THOSE GODDAMN ARROWS HIT SANGHEON THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!<
   * >!THAT POWER WALK YAS KING WALK!<
   * >!THE WAY I KEPT SCREAMING LIKE A LUNATIC SHE IS SO BEAUTFUL SHE IS SO POWERFUL HWI YOU BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL ROYALTY THE CROWN WAS MADE FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE POWEEEER!<
   * I didn't expect this to happen I love it now I'm nervous for the next 38 minutes
* Why is everything happening>! so fast why are all the loose ends all being addressed now something BAD IS HAPPENING i can feel it !<
* Yeah, you're the one who also >!kept the twins a secret grandma, AND agreed to the killing. I'm not falling for your fainting act I do not like you at all!<
* Oh no. Papa Jung -- just as you turned into a new leaf. But man, you did kill the prince and lots of people along the way. 
   * BSB's acting is just so spot on EVERYTIME he's on the screen. The way he tried to hide his natural shock >!about his sentence!< by remaining stoic in his speech but him blinking and avoiding Jiun's gaze gave it away. I may be stressed with this entire series, but it's such a pleasure watching him act. 
   * He wouldn't move his entire face, just his eyes twitching and it gives the entire emotion away UGH SO BEAUTIFUL I'm in awe!!!
* \*Sobs\* Jehyeon really looks up to Hwi it's so pure.
* This queen is a babie please she just wants to give you love letters she does not deserve this much of a heartbreak. But she has been so strong throughout. I love that this series shows strength in different forms in different people. Headstrong in Hwi and Gaon, calmness in Court Lady Kim, enthusiasm in Jiun, Hakyong, and Bok-dong, loyalty in Yoon, empathy in Hyun. They didn't have to show them carrying swords but you knew they were all strong.
* I'm glad they're addressing the elephant in the room: >!How Jiun's father has caused so much heartache, pain, and even danger to Hwi. I'm happy that they were realistic about Hwi's feelings of resentment towards him and didn't force a big, happy family in the end.!<
* Overall I'm just happy >!Hyun is alive and well. Excuse me while I head towards the temple of the drama gods and express my thanks.!<
* Good hecking heck,>! this grandpa has at most 2 years to live and yet would not freaking die. I TOLD Y'ALL to slash him I AM SO ANNOYED.!<
* OMG I KNEW THERE WOULD BE SHT HAPPENING I TOLD YOU ALL HOT DAMN I'm just glad that the ending isn't episode 19 because that was a letdown if I ever saw one.>! This coup is intense, it's the finale we all deserve!!<

&#x200B;

Let's go FINALE!!!!
Here we are folks, we're at the end of this show. Of course a happy ending is what I want and is hoping that nobody dies (well except for the bad guys). But you know, I wished >!the Royal Army would have surround the place faster so that Hyun's brother wouldn't have gotten away, break out Evil Gramps and rile up some soldiers to have that final fight in the palace thing. Heck, felt like it would have been better if Hyun had try to stop his brother before this and Hwi/Dami kill the Gramps right when arresting him. !<

But it wouldn't >!be called arresting now would it. Also, no one would have found out that The King was poisoned. I guess its also too much for Hyun to be able to cut down his brother.!< Anyways, looking forward for tomorrow. The upcoming fight reminds me of Tale of Nokdu cuz they also had >!a big fight in the palace at the end.!< Pls a happy end for our couple and the rest of the characters.
Preview is in Kbsdrama IG.. Hmmmmmmmm
**Ep 19**:

Everything seemed too good to be true and then the last five minutes happened...

If anyone wants the **direct link to the Ep. 20 preview** (you must be logged into Instagram and it's a story so it only lasts 24 hours, as of 3:30pm PST in the US, it has been 9 hours since it was posted so only available for the next 15 hours):

[https://www.instagram.com/stories/kbsdrama/2727833512274421765/](https://www.instagram.com/stories/kbsdrama/2727833512274421765/)
I don't know how to censor text on my phone so I'll be super vague. If it's not done right away, they're gonna come back.
Episode 19: They should have given more thought about the revelation scene that the king is actually Dam-i, it felt rushed, people waited long for that moment.. I expected more fluffy mushy buttery sweetness but the transition from the bonfire to the stairs was a bit anti-climactic, also the lines are not well-written it felt like it’s not the same writer as the one who wrote Jiun professing his love for the crowned prince.
**WHY DO I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE FINALE IS GOING TO BREAK EVERYONE HEARTS!!!!** 😭😭😭

Happiness & this drama has officially ended now I don’t know what to do with my life. 🥲
Loved it
I’m not sure how to do spoiler tags but I’ll try to be as general as possible. How did the green powder not affect both people that it was given to? It only hurt one person… I am confused
I’m literally seething at myself bc I haven’t watched it yet bc I don’t want it to end :,)))))
Looks like the >!hairpin replaced the ring!< as the token of love ☺️
[deleted]
Is this drama worth watching. Please tell Me
Don't love the ending. Don't hate it either.

Gunna miss Park Eun-Bin as a badass king and Rowoon being cute as ever.
I’m so scared 😂

—-

The pacing was super inconsistent in this episode but I think it’s still a solid one! I just wish they didn’t cram the action-heavy scenes towards the end of the series. I’m so excited to see >!Lord Sangheon’s downfall!< This better happen tomorrow!
[deleted]
Honestly, I’m too scared to watch the last few episodes. I purposely left ep 18 out so I’d binge the remaining episodes but why am I scared the ending will hurt me 😭🥴
>! Why Daddy Jung refused to go on with offing Lord Sangheon is beyond me. Like why the sudden hesitation? !<

>!Two, Jung!!! Pops said run, but you found it convenient to stand there until the arrow was shot, daf#q? !<

>!Three, second half of Episode 19 was too calm. Lowkey saw Flying Slap daddy escaping. Why not? When nobody bothered to go after Hyun's bother (Lord Woosan) who was obviously known to work with FSD.!<

>!Maybe, just maybe Ice Prince telling her queen her secret may help them in their current predicament, cause she really could have spoken the secret after her granddad was officially dead.!<

Now I haven't seen a show cause me this much heart palpitations. I could cry. All I want is my baby to finally have a chance at living peacefully as a girl with her beau and friends by her side. What more could a girl ask for? >!Also, Hyun please don't die a second time.!<

I don't think I can take it if she (Ice Prince) dies. But I see tragic deaths coming in the coming episode. However, we just might get an Inzaghi (Vincenzo)  moment.
i can't believe it's really the last epi today! i don't want it to end
Can someone help me find this [headband?](https://occ-0-2794-2219.1.nflxso.net/dnm/api/v6/9pS1daC2n6UGc3dUogvWIPMR_OU/AAAABddnjQZwB3J6kxcomHVvt5Yz5chOIGXpmZd_iUFyLjaiquRqq_gqmdQT2przhCD5xlNoZZM6kV9uT7JN3gpl57tSRYY1MuJeGZBfK5P27t-jyvb-.jpg?r=cd4) My friend really likes it and I want to buy it for her.

well that was incredibly disappointing.
Extremely glad I dropped this crappy drama early on (episode 8). The comments under this post are enough to further solidify the fact that this drama was boring and dragged out for way too long.
I think one of the most inspiring parts of this drama was highlighting how stupid misogyny is without constantly mentioning it explicitly. For example, the fact that these court officials were constantly boot-licking for her while on the flip side saying how women are weak or how a king that shared a womb with a woman would be unfit for king. Meanwhile they literally coronated a woman. 😂 I think this show did an excellent job at displaying the fallacies of people arguing that women aren't fit for world leadership offices, and misogyny in general. 

Another thing I noticed was when a certain woman shot an arrow at a certain asshat and he told her to "go inside, this is men's work" as if she didn't nearly shoot a bullseye through his eyes. 🤣 It made my blood boil, but I'm glad it did because that was the point it tried to make.
I successfully got two other people to watch it. Now my friend is bi panicking and can't decide which lead is more attractive to her lol. 

Notes after watching:

I loved that Jiwoon was the affectionate, pining, vocal one and Hwi was the stoic one. Kind of got a little tiring how they had to reject Jiwoon again and again and again, poor guy. I love that he took the whole Hwi being a guy thing in stride, it was very refreshing for there to not be a lot of time spent gay panicking. And then the scene at the edge of the lake... That he just said basically 'you're still you, I like you regardless no big now let me fix your wound' was awesome. 

The scene where Hwi said they were more comfortable in the men's style was ... Affirming. I get that. 

Got into two disagreements over whether the Royals twins being auspicious thing was an actual thing. 

Rowoon is my new bias there goes my life again... 

There's only five fics on ao3 on this series and this is a crime. Not sure why this series wasn't more popular.
all i have to say is i believe in the hyun and dragonslayer226 (gaon) supremacy
I think I must be getting old because while everyone was eye candy, Seok-Jo was so swoon worthy. He was terrifying, fascinating, kinda tiny, but you could barely tell because he slaughtered every scene.
Honestly, I love them so much! I wish moving forward there would be more non-toxic second leads!
I love all three so much and lowkey wished >!Hakyung and Hyun !<would get together. She's so silly but very loyal and good hearted and I think she'd make a great >!queen for Hyun. Would totally watch a season 2 of them getting together haha!<  

I didn't expect >!Soeun!< to grow on me either after she >!tried to kidnap Jiun's clinic girl (forgot her name)!<.

They were all great characters who didn't resort to pettiness and I guess that's why they are so unique compared to the old guard who was always hunting for power.
It's a good thing that's not his day job lol
Good thing he got promoted, then. 😂
Oh my he's always having a rough day
Lmao same! I kept shouting why do they keep giving him this assignment, the guy's resume on escorting isn't convincing 😂
Leave the fighting to Ji-woon and Hwi XD He's more in his element as a politician.
LOL that's exactly what I was thinking. But that second time I just HAD to laugh when each time >!Wansan tries to kill him, there's a NEW, timely intervention. !<

>!\*ready to slit brother's throat --> grandma to the rescue!<

>!\*defeats grandma --> Ga On appears!<

>!\*defeats him --> Seok-jo appears!<

>!Wansan: ffs, anyone else?!<
RIGHT?! This felt so weird to me compared to the rest of the show!!
He was freaking trying his best! It was wasn't his day ...
I can accept this...because i made fun of the 'inzaghi saving Vincenzo' theory.. And where did it take me!?
I'm accepting anything 😂
I think literally everyone's theory about how this would end was correct. I don't know how, but that ending simultaneously covered about 4 different hypothesis at once.
This honestly made me >!happier than seeing Yeonseon and Jiun live happily ever after by the sea.  Hyun deserves all the happiness as well.  Now if only we can find him a wife…!<
> We should have a spin-off for Eun-Seo / Ga-On- did anyone else wonder why he is still staying at yeongji’s house? 🤣

I'm happy he got to show his dimples before the show ended 😂
5 they actually covered in the series at one point. Probably a few times actually, but I don't remember specifically. Gramps tricked him into committing a crime, then said that he would protect him and his family if he continued to work for him. The more he worked for gramps, the more crime/deeper he got until he felt there was no way out. His family would be killed by gramps for stopping, but his family would be killed for his crimes regardless. That's why he kept repeating that he never had a choice.
What is the significance of the rabbit???!
Maybe she survived due to the power of love and friendship? Hahah
I think Prince Wonsan >!didn't survive th fatal wound!<. The >!golden pill Hwi ate might be the reason she made it out alive!<
that line along with the smirk dami gave to her evil grandpa is absolutely fantastic!!!!! MIC DROP Y’ALL!!! the look on his face oooohhhhh serve you right! rot in hell!
HAHHAHA I love your comments - These and the thread here made watching TKA so so fun! 🙌

>>!Just for once ask if Hyun’s ok!< 

Lol- yes 🙌 >!Her parting advice to his entourage was even to ‘ensure’ that he wouldn’t run away from the palace.LMAO. I also realised they never showed us her reply to Hyun’s offer to whisk her away on a sailboat but she took the red shoes!!< 

Now I feel bad for Hyun even though >!he survived and even became king. Ok, I need The New King’s affection part 2, pronto!!!< 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol yes yes yes to all your points! When the camera panned to the >!Queen Dowager I literally pumped my fist like finally, you heard the ruckus that always seems to be happening outside your very thin walls!!<

Bae Soo Bin deserves the world. When he was a >!sputtering blood  I was like no stop I already know you're dying stop being so believable !<

I loved that smirk, too. She's a proper kind of twisted I love it.
Omg your comments had me laughing to myself like an idiot 😂 gonna miss coming here sm
OMG, you killed me with the lifespan comment. So sad but true.
[deleted]
I didn't think I'd like it this much as well. Looking back at it now, the flaws don't really matter anymore 🤣❤️
In Chinese dramas they often have this special pill (靈丹) that people swallow that is supposed to help combat poisons. See it in a lot of fantasy dramas like Monkey King. Scientifically, i assume it works like activated charcoal and just absorbs/adheres to the poison so it doesn't digest and just passes through the system one way or another. 

If you liked this one, I suggest moonlight drawn by stars and splish splash love !
Oooh, I'm new to period kdramas. Is Tale of Nokdu another good one? Also gender bender?
I guess >!the golden pill helped absorb much of the poison!<.
"Grandaddy Nomes and their Flying Slaps" will be the name of my garage band.

This was a pretty good one, and I enjoyed it. Would I watch it again? Naa.

I also enjoyed my time here on this sub. Sometimes it was better than the episode!
>>! I wish they'd just thrown us a bone and told us that Ji-un had discovered an herb that would counter the poison or sth.!<

>!I thought maybe she had built up a resistance to it in small doses - hidden in the anxiety pills, maybe. Ha, ha.!<
Hwi is so cool when she leads an army and swordfights by herself. Even grandma queen dowager is proficient in arrows.
>>!Why does Hwi keep entrusting her people to Hyun to protect and escort? Boy's really sweet but he's so useless in a fight?! She should've gotten the hint when he lost Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong to her granddaddy.!<

this was my thought process too. >!they were also taking Gyeom out of the palace in the open instead of getting the future king out covertly, like tf !!!<

>>!Really love how Hwi held her own in the fights and took down so many men. Her asking Ji-un to buy her a pin is practically her proposing to him as well, since hairpins are for married women.!<

wot ?? i didnt know that, that is so sweet!! >!also go Hwi for being the one to subtly propose!!!<

>>!Really love how Hwi held her own in the fights and took down so many men. Her asking Ji-un to buy her a pin is practically her proposing to him as well, since hairpins are for married women.!<

>!she looked so free, happy and light in it, it was such a sweet dream!!<
Ugly cried at the dream sequence.
It is speculated that lord grandpa made Hwi vomit some of the poison when strangling her...so lord evil saved her instead!..LOL
> Also, I will never get tired of her initiating the kissing!

100 points to this! I love it when she just grabs Jiun's neck like cmere you blubbering fool let me kiss the living daylights out of you 😂

&#x200B;

>Really love how>! Hwi held her own in the fights and took down so many men. Her asking Ji-un to buy her a pin is practically her proposing to him as well, since hairpins are for married women.!<

oh wow I didn't know about this one! And i also agree she was so >!badass in that scene like yes, smash that sheath onto that crony's face!!<
I also think it’s insinuated that the golden pill medicine thing she took prior to taking the poison helped absorb the poison. Someone else said in an earlier episode, Ji-un took it before drinking and he didn’t get drunk
I totally agree with the first point. I’m so happy someone else shares the same sentiment. >!She had no business entrusting Hyun to protect her brother in the end. It broke my heart, especially when she said “it will be fine”.!<
Exactly! Love it when female leads intiate the kiss :)
Same!!! 😭😭😭
> LORD SANGHEON'S DOWNFALL! He better bleed and crumble. Idk about u guys, but there will be no room for forgiveness here.

I hope when this happens, it will be as spectacular as his diva entrances have been.
All I’m hoping for is Hwi getting to soap opera slap her evil grandfather just like he slapped his rival.

That and for Hyun to be happy. That poor man has not known a moment of happiness since basically childhood 🥺
Sequel- The Hyun's affection
Hyun needs a happy ending, I laughed at the end because he got completely shafted in all departments. Lol
This reminded me of Won’s comment about her >!being complicit in the murder of his grandfather.!< I’d love to know more about that and if she actually was or it was Won’s emotions and beliefs about what happened
I’m also sad that she had to go, but it was realistic in the context of the rules of the day. I liked how she faced the music instead of hiding - that speaks to how strong her character really is. >!She was not afraid of the consequences to her - be it finally dealing the ultimate power move to her grandpa, or owning up to her deception. The aftermath was such sweet reward, and she is finally really free.!<

She might not have been able to effect a lot of changes to the world, as her father envisioned, but she did the next best thing - >!got someone with the same values on the throne. Also she made reparations for the sin of her grandfather - though Hyun wasn’t the vindictive cousin, it was sweet poetic justice that the throne ended back in his lineage.!<
Yep, love those childhood moments that reflected in their adulthood. He's still not the best but he tried and trained :)
ikr? >!He's trying so hard to act serious in court, when he's been saving her ass the entire show.!<
Agree, they were wonderful! Superb acting from Bae Soo bin as well!
i thought he would end up with so eun or ha kyung. i want him to find someone, boy deserves so much love!
That could actually be a key thing - Jiun might not have been able to >!get to Hwi in time to help save her life if they didn’t catch Court Lady Kim.!<
Same!!!! I was screaming at my tv. They really got me during the last half of the episode. Did not know what to expect
That's what all K-Dramas are for!
LOL yeah 😂 I was so worried it would be a sad ending 🥺 I was preparing myself to be depressed for the rest of the year 😅
Yes, she truly >!looked liberated and happy!< in the final scenes. And I love how she had to tip toe in the >!kiss scene by the sea. !<
If not on your sageuk radar yet - currently airing Red Sleeve is great and definitely worth checking out.
True! The characters were great that’s why it was so easy to get invested with them
Yeah, this is the first kdramas I've watched in a long while and now it's got me out of my slump and hyped up, I finished it in 2 days, pheww what a ride
i really thought they would end the drama with >!that dream sequence and leave it open ended!< but i’m glad they didn’t!
Watch The Red sleeve! It’s airing right now.
> later this week it's the end of jirisan

The last episode of Jirisan (episode 16) already finished airing on 12th December, last Sunday.
Amen! The finale really saved it.
I think it’s because of the pill. Am i the only one who noticed that earlier in the series, Ji-un took a round pill when Hwi was getting him drunk so he wouldn’t get wasted and then now, before she drank tea with grandfather she took a similar pill. Prolly why she did not die?
I was asking myself the same question for the rest of the episode too!! I probably couldn't focus as much on the proceeding events because of the unknown of how Hwi managed to survive the poison. Nevertheless I'm so relieved we got a happy ending 🥺 I'm also grateful that there's this Reddit forum I could run to after every episode when there was something I was confused on; so seeing others' comments on the pill(s) gave me some clarification lol.
I watched this show for Park Eun Bin and a good trailer. That's saying a lot because I don't watch dramas much anymore. I knew she was going to be good and she did not disappoint! Really enjoyed everyone else too. I don't get SL syndrome often but Nam Yoon Su is just too cute.
For me too! I would wake up in the middle of the night to watch it or first thing in the morning haha.. and be so tired later in the day but still be catching up on all the scenes on Insta and reading the reddit threads
I don't think there would’ve been any other way to prove that she's a female though. Gaon would probably look feminine if his hair was down, too. Also, Papa and Son Jung didn't even reason the fact that Hwi might be a female when they saw her dressed as one. And for something as crucial to the queen's life as that reveal, she probably wouldn't have believed it if Hwi had just said it or put down her hair. >!Showing the boobies!< is the silliest, but most effective choice.

Besides, they are both girls. There would be nothing really weird with that. It might’ve have also been a sign of trust and deep respect for Hakyung, just as Hwi did with Jiun. 

At least, she didn't >!undress!< in front of the Queen Dowager.
Hehehe, what if she opted to just, whoosh! lift up her hanbok to show her other lady parts instead. Or like, a Basic Instinct subtle reveal. It is so beyond immature, but I cannot stop laughing at how that would play out in dramaland 😂
>>!Man boobs are a thing you know!<

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hoping you got to watch the last episode? !!!😋
Had she not been born a twin she may have lived as the pampered and carefree princess she really is. 😭 her life was so tragic
Yes! Wonsan was so hot I literally started dumping after his first on screen moment.. too bad he turned out evil  🥺
So agree about the fringe. He looked way better with that hair!
That's what made Jiun so freaking lovable, I know it's usually the macho masculine cool guy ML, but I really love gentle attentive ML for a change
I was hopeful too until i saw someone said maybe she was buried by the sea😂😂
I became a fan of Rowoon because of this drama and I have to thank Park Eunbin (and my undying love for her) for that 😂 

I’m so excited for Tomorrow!
I was a puddle of tears the whole second half!!!
Agh, so good !!!
What a great way to end off the year LOL
Yes I was almost expecting that the >!alternate universe is how they wanted to end to make it the happy ending haha!<
Yea made more sense that commander king died that way because of all his crimes, he wouldn’t have gone unpunished and they wouldn’t have made hwi punish him or  execute him
>I find it somewhat hilarious that someone who’s sliced left right and centre and bleeding profusely from the mouth can be up and walking around like nothing happened after a few days

I can just imagine this as a Pitch-Meeting skit:

Producer: After all these injuries, won't Hyun have a long and difficult healing process?

Writer: Actually it's gonna be super easy! Barely an inconvenience!

Producer: Oh really?
Dude you're halarious 🤣😂 the evil grandpa bit killed me. I'm dead.
I actually didn't understand why this show emphasized that letting down her hair meant she was a girl. I thought it was not unusual for men to have long hair, unless I'm mistaking that for a different era/culture. We did have a moment with Court Lady Kim that showed the significance of long hair for women, so maybe it isn't so for men?

In that case, it's foolish for the Hwi to leave her hair grown out while she's masquerading as a man.
I agree that the writing was definitely off. A bit disappointing considering that TKA has managed to maintain a relatively consistent pace and quality for the last 18 episodes. I hope the finale is better.
This is hilarious! But, it's a KDrama and that's why we love them so
>!Pinkie and the Brain rebellion!< I’m HOWLING!! Hahahahahaha.
Agreed. There were so may chances to kill the bad guys but it never happened.
Exactly! They had it in the freaking bag too 😭
I think when >!Hyun’s dad died, it was Hwi’s grandad - Queen Dowager’s husband - who got to be crown prince, not Hwi’s dad.!< Hwi’s grandad and Hyun’s grandad I think were brothers.
> Now even Prince Gyeom is taller than Hwi! How old is he? 12?

He is 14 years old
Yes to everything. There were so many missed chances to have a truly clever cat and mouse game between the protagonists and antagonists. A missed opportunity.
Dying @ u still a dumbass tho 😂😂😂 I was saying the same thing when he went thru everything BUT a blue box! Lmaoooo sorry I doubted u boo boo!
Daddy Jung disappointed everyone in this episode. Like, why didn't he just >!push the sword in deeper!<? The most that would've happened is that he'd be killed, but it's not like he doesn't deserve it🙄
I was shouting at the TV when Jiun was looking for the blue box by opening every colour of box 😂

Edit: spelling
Agree, the Child(ren) killer suddenly grew a heart or is it personality transplant for the convenience of pre-ending ...
Eunseo gave Yeongji a bag for keeping the herbs that they forage in the woods. That’s why Jeonggil came protesting why he didn’t get 1 as well. Lol.
I noticed too that in the last episodes her voice has changed, like she doesn't have to lower her voice because everyone around her knows the truth anyway.

Regarding their height difference: >!during the scene where she confesses to the ML you can see that Dami's height is different depending on camera'a angle. For me is more like a production inconsistency!< I saw some photos from Rowoon's previous drama bts, and the main actress from Just Between Lovers had to stand on a step stool in some scenes. I guess they used something like this in this drama too.
Apparently it's not that easy to be an actor if you're that tall too :D
Did you know that >!Prince Wonsan!< is taller than Ji-un\~?

And he's >!only 22 years old!<. Cmon man\~ 😫
All hail! He’s perfect in this role. Can’t think of someone better for it. So pure and wholesome.
PLEASE THAT IS ALL I ASK FOR 😭😭😭
>!wish granted!<
Preach!
Another alternative would be >! That the dream world is the actual reality, ie Dami just woke up from her nightmare about an alternative world where she took over her brother’s spot and had to deal with political. So after Court Lady joked about her brother was grateful about her taking his spot on the last lecture, she replied that she didnt want to switch place anymore because of her horrible nightmare. His actual brother took the throne and ha gyeomg became the bride of his brother……then we can even have 32 episodes or season 2 of drama!<
I thought you were describing Mr queen
Omg i forgot about So Eun, i hope she found out about the true identity of the king? Otherwise, poor girl, she didnt even know the true identity of her enemy
Ooh I am waiting for the BTS for the episodes too!! ◡̈
Agreed with the female intimacy dominance, like usually FL are the ones being kissed and shocked like girl you like the guy right? Wouldn't you be enjoying this too? Also that moment she pushed him to sit and he was like I don't want to be teased 🥺🤭 my favorite scene
Where did you see the preview? Netflix didn’t show anything.
Even with her world shattered, even with all her dreams crashing down around her, even though she has been shaken to her core, Ha-kyung remains devoted to her King.
I assume the golden pill she took for "anxiety" soaked up the poison. I remember a few episodes back (ep 6 or 7?)  when Ji Un first gave it to her that he said it was made of dragon tears and was the best medicine of that time. Something like that someone please confirm lol she probably didn't even realize that pill was that strong cause she woke up surprised she was still alive lol

Edit: I just remembered back to the episode where Hwi (CP at the time) was trying to get Ji Un drunk and he swallowed something before hand to absorb the alcohol. Was it the same pill? 😱😱
Hide and seek and full of you puts me in such a giddy mood I love it lol
I Believe is my favorite, then Hide and Seek then No Goodbye in Love. The score is also good, and I’ve only now started to recognize some of them.
I have all of them them on my Spotify too! ◡̈
Park Eun Bin (Hwi/Dami) is the veteran among the young adult cast, her last drama before this was Do You Like Brahms? which I loved even if it feels quite heavy.

My Drama List should be a good resource for you to see the cast’s previous works.
For Rowoon (Jung Ji Woon) he was amazing in extraordinary you
I loved PEB in hello my twenties esp season 2. Her character there is sooo different n sooo funny and natural - it didn't feel like acting, it felt real. Especially the last few eps her acting really won my heart. That's how i started watching king's affection cuz of her.
Someone once said “plot armour” in these threads

And I now move through life happily believing that is a real thing and that it will protect our precious Hyun MAYBE LOL a girl can hope 😂
OMG enjoy Hot Stove League! I watched it earlier this year and it’s one of my faves!
Oh, I loved **Hot Stove League!** I don't really know how true it is to real live off season baseball, but it was interesting as heck. I couldn't watch it slowly!

PEB was great in it and, of course, the spectacular Namkoong Min.
I'm dying at the >!bye bitch!< 😂😂😂👏🏽
If you want to check out another historical drama, try “the red sleeve cuff” ongoing right now. It’s really great
Yeah I didn't expect her to do that at all.
I’m so scared to watch it, the previous almost made me cry 🥴🥴
I had to come and see I was so torn up through those first 20 mins I turned it off.  Too frelling painful.

Need to settle down and watch it calmly 2nite with nice class of Malbec.  Thank you
>! They said Price Wonsan was fatally wounded so it is safe to assume that he passed away. !<
I agree with all your points! I suddenly have a knot in my stomach because of that clip. Now I'm scared to watch how it ends 😭
Honestly that clip only make me lose hope that we'll get a happy ending 😣

About number 4 -> I remember that in 100 days my prince >!D.O was wearing similar clothes when they got married so maybe that's actually what grooms were supossed to wear on their weddings in Joseon era 😅 !<
Agree with The Red Sleeve. I can now focus on Yi San and Deok Im as I try to nurse my TKA withdrawal 😂
Hahaha 🙌
What bothered me was that they decided to saddle PEB with a >!massive married lady’s bun just so the *binyeo* can be held up properly, when all this time her top bun was so small.!<
Looking to starting that next!!!!
Now that I finish this, I am going to start Red Sleeve. Otherwise I got confused with the characters…
I already started on Red Sleeve and decided to pause until I finished TKA. Where TKA is angsty, emo and sweet, Red Sleeve has more UST and I liked that contrast. I’m excited to continue since it’s extended by 1 more episode :)
Thank you for writing this. I really enjoyed it, as I am a rambler myself. I also liked the last paragraph you wrote about how the drama can be enjoyed at first and studied later. I had so many thoughts and opinions about the show from watching clips on insta before each episode got subbed, then more thoughts on my first watch, and even more views after reading comments like this.

I had arrived at so many conclusions and theories at the end of ep 20, but seeing this writeup opened my eyes to so much more. There's a lot to be said about TKA, but I think I've already said more than enough, so I'm gonna keep my thoughts to myself.

I guess that's what makes a drama memorable for me. The fact that I'm invested enough to theorize about it and flesh out each character in my mind is a huge feat to achieve. TKA has left a lasting impression on me, and I'm sad to let it go.
Im jealous of your persistence, I search Twitter and this subreddit weekly to see the spoilers before I can watch the episode
🥰🥰🥰
Probably his future son? 🤷🤷🤷🤷
There is a lady waiting somewhere to trip and fall into his arms, just like the many ladies before in the show… lol
In a way yes. >!Also her inaction just to show that even though she is the most senior among the royal family, had so many effects on others (e.g. the late king's second wife was wrongfully accused and executed). And yet she wanted to use another lie to cover Dam-I's death to allow her to live in hiding again. !<

>!While other females leads were fighting to have a place (Dam-I as King, Ha-Kyung's determination to become Queen, So-Eun's determination to be with the one she loves)!<
Oh my god your last comment LOL

You may be the only one ?!
Omg you should watch King2Hearts if you miss grandpa
They're on YouTube as well
Is the score not already on Spotify? The album had already been released. They don’t always include everything though.

https://open.spotify.com/album/77B2nbDb1xcZAk8PyuJI6W?si=oe1voGiORl-GyQE1dB_XNA
I'd say the manhwa is more tragic, Hyun's ending is the same though but >!the Queen and all the people who knew about Hwi's secret die and the ending is kinda open as it's not clear if Hwi survived or not!< ...
That's a huge shift! If Gaon is the lead, then Hwi's family killed his (and the real Hwi died while trying to stop it). Ji-woon being the lead, technically his dad "killed" her. The feelings of guilt are flipped.
I mean at the end of the day it’s a KDrama… like 95% of them will end up with happy endings. For me personally it’s a suspension of disbelief type of thing.
As much as i want to be realistic but i do enjoy the >!happy ending!< even though it doesn’t make sense whatsoever….i was so devastates when >!Hwi started coughing blood and had the dream!< i was ready to stop the episode and never finish watching it.
"Paenghyeon", which they explained as erasing any traces of "him" from the palace records. They justified it by saying that "Hwi" was technically non-existent. He had died as a young crown prince. Also, the new king (Hyun) had agreed with his subjects' petition that so many people had a hand in making a woman the king of Joseon are to share in her punishment. So, basically, there wasn't much to be punished for.
The King’s Affection Episode 20 sees Ji Un begging the Queen Dowager to sentence Hwi to paenghyeong. It is a grave punishment wherein a person is thrown into boiling water and left to die.

Ji Un reasons out that Hwi is a person who does not exist in the first place as he already died a long time ago.

With the identity of Hwi being sentenced to paenghyeong and removing all records of his life, Dami can recover her identity as a woman so she can lead a new life.

You're not the only one. The first time I saw her with Jiun, I was taken aback. I could tell she was a bit too old to be a love interest, but she looked way too young to be his mother. Until she mentioned it herself, and I saw a few lines on her face.
Wow!!! You guessed most of them right!!!
Because >!good looking people in TKA just heal really fast. (See Ga-On, Hyun for example)!< 

😂
I just explained this to my family. My theory is that >! she is younger so probably has better resistance. Also, Jiwoon reached there in time to help her. And maybe the poison's concentration was stronger at the bottom of the pot. She poured her cup first and then her grandfather's. So maybe his dose was stronger than her. !<
This is all I could think of the whole rest of the episode, lol. I was just like, but… but… but… literally they could have thrown one line of dialogue in!
I remember in an earlier episode when he first gave her those pills that they were made of dragon tears and was the strongest medicine to date in those times. I don't even think she knew it was that strong because she woke up so surprised lol I'm glad Ji Un kept giving those to her to ease her anxiety so she just took it again because of habit. That's what im thinking hopefully someone else can confirm this lol
I'm assuming they gave her an antidote
Well the Ming visiting episode is important for that it is the reason why Ji-un was forced to be in the palace in the first place. Whether it warrants 2 episodes on it.. i cant say much. But it demonstrated on how Hwi resolved the disputes for Ji-un and also with the Great Eunuch. She's not someone who's always waiting for Ji-un and Hyun to cover for her.
>!no confirmation he’s dead but I think it’s safe to assume so. They said the wound is too deep and Hyun is king.!<
I bet. There are a lot of flaws in this show, but I'm still happy the end picked up a bit, even with the inconsistencies in writing. I just came for PEB who never disappoints.
This is why I prefer reading here on Reddit. You can criticize something without being mean. And there were a lot of homophobic comments on MDL the time when Jiwoon thinks he was inlove with a man.
If you don't mind... whats MDL\~?
For So-Eun's first appearance, she was mean. But Ji-un taught her that she should also care for others (or something I will need to rewatch that episode), that's why So-Eun is so attracted by Ji-un.
1. So Eun probably was desperate and super vain that she would do anything to maintain her beauty as she was still young and unmarried lol and she didn't think he would come back. I don't tie her personality faults (in the beg) to her dad tho. I think Ji Un was her last resort

2. I remember Sangheon nudging Commander Jung to kill her when she asked him where Dam-I went... and of course he obliged 🙄 I don't think it was necessary to kill her but I think back in those days they didn't want Dam-I's past coming back to haunt them... how the tables have turned looooool
#1 I think they need a dramatic entrance of jiwoon for his return and to show how desperate the ladies are to get their acne treatment before Proactiv 

#2 to show Ji woon how cruel his dad is and he will kill anyone who will endanger his family. Also to show Hwi that Ji woon is not on his dad’s side and to threaten her to keep her mouth shut and be the prince otherwise more innocent people will die
>!ugh I very much regret watching that preview. Maybe things won’t turn out as bad as they seem? I feel like we already caught a break with Hyun’s survival though.!<
But I think it might still be a happy ending although there may be some deaths
Watch the red sleeve ! I’m also enjoying melancholia too
>!the golden pill she swallowed before she drink the poisonous tea might have saved her.!<
Yeah I am annoyed >!the ring didn’t show up on Dami’s finger. But then it’s going to be awkward if Hyun insisted on giving it to her. He should just keep it for someone else - like maybe if he has a daughter.!<
So… the chemistry between the leads is incredibly sweet, but the politics and realism regarding physical fights and what people do when they are wounded or how fast they recover, and around who actually has enough power to protect the lead, is real. Not to mention tons of irrational decisions by characters towards the end. The plot armour is so obviously thick! 

Had hope for some tying together of plot points and further character development, but was disappointed on those notes. On the other hand, it is a >!happily ever after for the most part!< so if that’s what you care about…
it's honestly one of the best historical dramas of 2021! 20 episodes may seem intimidating at first, but the story is well-paced enough that each episode is entertaining and leaves you curious. the writers did really well with every character, and i love the gender swap aspect, and how the stereotypes are flipped when it comes to the main leads. our fl is pretty cold and composed, while the ml is righteous, bubbly, and always cheerful. i love the different side characters and how they play into the story too, like hwi's cousin, bodyguard gaon, court lady kim, eunuch hong, the queen, and even the ml's friends.

definitely worth the watch!! rowoon, park eunbin and all the other actors (even the punchable characters like the grandfather and the uncle) did really well!!
Definitely
Yes!
I'd say if you like the actors, it's a good watch. I watched for the FL who is a great actress. But it's not the best written drama. I found the middle to have quite a few rather meaningless set-ups and plot items that didn't contribute much. And the romantic relationship was pretty immature. Not the best show out there, unfortunately.
I think around 9:30 EST?

Hahhaa! That said, >!kudos to him for surviving against the sageuk second leads fate! I think he and his brother are like absolute geniuses in this show against everyone else. He foretold the rebellion from a POEM.*mic drop*!!<
Lmaooo I think he just had bad luck for the second half of the show cause he's a badass swordsman remember in the beginning when he chopped off evil uncles beads for messing with Hwi? And he walked off like a boss lol
I read your comment and because of my user flair I had to comment and say that I am glad you have learned the error of your ways in doubting the power of Inzhagi.
Hahaha he had a few >!close shaves with death!< and I am just glad he managed to >!pull through!<. 

It would have been nice to have an open ending (>!with him helming court as king, so that a season two could revolve around him and eun-Seo or even the hint of romance!!<) but I guess not. 😬
don’t  worry y’all i stand as tribute
It's the only time we see Byungchan's dimples!
Oh thanks! ◡̈ must have missed it out. 🙌
Don't forget the thoughts and prayers 😂
It’s the power of being good looking. >!Many people like Ga-On, Hyun have proven this is a real thing in TKA!< 🤣🤣🤣
That's what I was thinking too. Something with the drug interactions
that’s what i’ve been thinking too…maybe somehow the ‘medicine’ that ji-un had gave her before to reduce her anxiety must have helped her…that’s the only valid reason on how she survived…
I agree! The drama was great, and then coming to the discussions every week to talk with people on this thread and read peoples hysterical comments, all in it together, really make it one of the best experiences I’ve had! Thanks king’s affection community!
Thank you, I always knew I was a clown 😂😂😂 jk! 

Poor Hyun 😂😂😂
If only the >!golden pill!< is a real PPL; I would totally buy it. 😂😂😂😂
This makes sense! Thanks!
It's one of the best saeguks imo! The gender bender thingy goes on for only a few episodes, >!with ML pretending to be a woman who adopts FL!< t's hilarious. The drama is just the right amount of comedy, romance, a little drama, and political intrigue--which makes me think that this drama is perfect for new to saeguks like u. 

Also, the entire cast has top notch acting, eye candy visuals, and perfect ost. 

U really should try it.
Ah, I suppose that's possible. Since they focused on >!her eating it before ordering Court Lady Kim to do the deed!<.
Yeah, I believe the golden pill was a callback to when Ji-un took it to prevent himself from getting drunk. I can’t remember exactly, but it was in the first few episodes when Hwi was trying to force him to quit when he first became a scholar.
The pill must've helped slow down the poison's effect. Plus, Jiwoon was there at the onset of symptoms so she was well taken care of right away. Jiwoon nursed her back to health and stayed with her til she recovered. He must've have given her antidote non-stop while she was unconscious.
Yeh I thought they would do a small explanation for that but I guess it’s easy enough to deduce that if you are keen to know how she survived. Would have still been cool if there was an ahah moment haha..
LOL
This is exactly my thinking. Ji-un always wanted to protect her, and the anxiety meds probably were a known antidote to either poison or general illness. Overtime she took them whenever she felt anxiety so she definitely had built up antibodies or immunity to the most severe symptoms of the poison. He essentially gave her an immunization to the known severe illnesses of the time.
True! (I won't mind seeing him burst through a door open one last time though)
The one true diva of the series
I lost it at diva entrances
What I wanted is for Hwi to say to Gyeom "Become a king, you're big sister commands you" \^\_\~
I would totally watch this. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
>>!got someone with the same values on the throne. Also she made reparations for the sin of her grandfather - though Hyun wasn’t the vindictive cousin, it was sweet poetic justice that the throne ended back in his lineage.!<

This, I think, is the perfect way to describe the ending. It was >!poetic!<.
This is so true. It showed that for weak rulers, they place the burden on others for their decisions and actions, like her grandfather and grandmother and mother and father. But for Hwi, she broke it and placed her integrity and actions on herself, as important as her life.
He’s literally like >! “oh interesting. Wow. Hmm.well yes this does seem serious. I wonder what’s for lunch? Oh right right let’s let the last guy also have his say and then I can just get this matter over with”!< 😂
I first saw PEB in **Do You Like Brahms**. You all know how depressing *that* character was.

When she was smiling at the end, she was unrecognizable to me!
I definitely will. Thank you!
Literally was about to throw my phone away if that happened 😂😂 but yes glad they gave all our faves a >!happy ending!< 🧡 just missing >!yoon!<
I keep seeing good things about this show! I'll def check it out thank you 🙏🏽
I watch it on viki so I have to wait as the  last episodes aren't available until Thursday and Friday 🥲
Yes it was the pill she took while talking to court lady Kim, I don't even think she knew that she would be still alive after getting poisoned lol but Ji Un made it a habit to always give her those when she was feeling anxious.
I completely forgot about that haha. I don’t understand the mechanic but that’s good for me. Why they didn’t try to make it a little more obvious is still beyond me though.
He does protective devoted hyung so we'll you can't help getting SLS
It all went by so fast..😭😭😅
hahhahaha!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yes I'm so relieved! 🥰🥰 at the same time I'm so sad it's over they could've squeezed in a bonus episode on their life with marriage/kids and etc 😂😂 me just being greedy lol
I could really use a man like Jiun the gentle giant irl tbh 😄
Lmaoooooooi
I think Rowoon struck gold getting PEB as an acting partner, as well as Bae Soobin! He has the chops and held his own but they must have taught him so much.  I’m also excited for Tomorrow!
I guess, you are right 😄 - Because >!Hwi looks really good as a guy and girl!<, letting the hair down ->!for Hwi may not be enough to convince the Queen that she’s a girl. It would be a comedy if Hwi let down her hair in a dramatic reveal and the queen only raised her eye brow slightly and say “and your point is…?” Lmao. Yeah so maybe the show is right; in boobies we trust!!<
Maybe the writer went for a day off >!with Hwi’s hairstylist!< 😂😂😂

Sure hoping for a strong finale, but not sure how they would cover >!1 full episode of quelling the grandpa army and resolve for a HEA!< —> if they bring in the >!OTT ming envoy to resolve this, I’d totally vote for!< u/Tough-Leadership6412 ‘s teletubbies ending.  😆😆😆😆
I agree too! The pacing was inconsistent too. I really hope the finale delivers my much needed closure hahaha
Gyeom is 14? He was born after Hwi's mum died and the King remarried, which was ten years ago, right? Or am I missing something?
Yeah, like come on Jeonggil let the man make the moves on your sister. I swear Eunseo looked very young and sweet in that scene. Boy is in looooooove 😍
I also wondered if a stool might have been in use! I looked up the actress’s height and she’s hardly short. Then I saw the ML is well over 6 feet. 😭

Agreed with you on the camera angles  - I also noticed this. Maybe they can spin it as an artistic choice rather than an inconsistency. 😂
Soeun would have found out about Hwi since her dad was the first one to intervene on her behalf in the royal court. Lord Shin was also the guy Hwi brought in to check Sangheon.
I think she found out about her identity since her father is a court official and gossip goes around quick in the palace 😂
Yeah. >!Perhaps a cute 30-secs banter between So-Eun and Hyun/Ga-On would have open up a lot more things. But people will probably complain that's just a consolation storyline. It is what it is I guess. !<
SAME THEY’RE SO EFFING CUTE
Kbsdrama IG stories
Damn ok very observant! You’re probably right
Is DYLB worth my time? I binged Hot Stove League over the weekend while waiting for the final 2 episodes. I enjoy Hot Stove League very much but sadly PEB is more of a supporting cast than a FL. But she's still very good in it.

Good thing PEB's next series will also be on Netflix. 🥰
Not gonna lie, I wish >!he suffered more, but at least Queen Grandma left him with no funeral and burial and to literally just rot in hell haha!<
Same with Flower Crew, it’s the same robe ~~Kim Su~~ Lee Su wore before he got kidnapped.
Oh okay. Maybe I was overthinking it. Thanks!
I did notice it was really big when she turned around! Dear stylist - you had ONE job!!??
Aww I think you can still share your thoughts! Thank you as well for taking the time to read it, I just wanted to express my feelings since I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this 😂

>I guess that's what makes a drama memorable for me. The fact that I'm invested enough to theorize about it and flesh out each character in my mind is a huge feat to achieve. TKA has left a lasting impression on me, and I'm sad to let it go.

\- Likewise! I don't think I'll be watching another drama anytime soon lol. I started TKA because I just wanted a fluffy drama on the side, I didn't expect I'd be so invested in it that it made me join this subreddit and also theorize.>! Popular theories included Hyun being the king but I didn't expect (or did anyone?) the army would be mobilized in the end and that floored me!<! It's what made me love TKA even more: It understood its audience but still had a few stuff on its sleeve. Also, this community and the episode threads also helped me enjoy & appreciate the drama more. I'm glad we all enjoyed the finale we deserve!
Same, and I’m not watching the rest of the drama if it has a bad ending! I just can’t :(
One of those ladies was actually Jiun, the female lead lol
Yes was so glad that Hwi >! Is determined not to continue live in hiding, such horrible grandma and grandpa that Hwi has and both are greedy. I guess born as royal bloodline is a curse !<
But he's sooo ridiculous with his OTT entrances and weird laughs I can't take him seriously LOL
*Immediately adds to watch list*
>Omg you should watch King2Hearts if you miss grandpa

Omg no wonder that actor looked familiar!!
Thanks for your response. From my understanding you are referring to the theme songs (the vocal tracks) instrumental. I'm referring to the score, there's a particular song I'm looking for that doesn't seem to be on the official soundtrack or on YouTube. I'm new to kdramas so i don't know how the score gets released.
Thanks for the clarification. I was under the assumption they would release everything.
>!I wondered if it had something to do with the anxiety pill she took when she was asking court lady kim to brew the poison tea!<
MyDramaList website.
Calm down with the bold text lol. 

Still don’t understand why So-Eun did that as it is 100% out-of-character, she clearly is a rational person as seen in latter episodes. I was expecting her to be a “mean girl” because of that but as it turns out she isn’t that kind of person. I liked her character overall but that was a very confusing way to introduce a female second lead. But I love your answer, it was funny.

I understand that Ji-Un’s dad used to be much more ruthless especially when he was younger but he spared some lives too even when he had to kill(he had the chance to kill Kim Ga-On when the archers killed Commander Yoon and I know the death of his friend left him shaken but why kill Il-Wol?)He shouldn’t have killed Il-Wol, even his own son was there begging him to not do it. But I guess, he was just really an asshole during that timeline. Lol.
yes im also watching **The Red Sleeve**
How about **Melancholia**, is it actually good???
Ohhhhhhhhh that makes sense!
Yah I am still holding out hope for TKA2 featuring the >!New King’s affection!< 🥰
Convinced
Oh my bad, I updated it already
I don’t get the logic of Wonsan sending the poem. Was he taunting Hyun? Warning him to stay away? Or he just wants the fame for creating a genius of a clue? 

Maybe he wants more readership for his poems… so poet!Wonsan redemption arc AU?
Yes ma'am of course I remember that! That was the moment I started having SLS.

Maybe he just needed to be angry to fight well.
🤣🤣🤣
Yeah, other soldiers die in one slash, while they can survive multiple slashes. HAHA
Oooh, sounds interesting! Thanks for the recommendation 👍😁
>!They did. I immediately thought Hwi will not die because of that.!<
>!I don't think she knew it would save her either! She may not be the best politician in this story but this little lady unknowingly outsmarted her gramps.!<

>!How fitting that his medicine was what saved her. <3!<
I’m confused, what pill is this and when did she take it? Just watched the final episode and didn’t see her taking a golden pill? Is this from an earlier episode?
Ok but when ji-soon >!screamed out for somebody to come help him while holding Hwi after the poison,!< I was like…>!there’s no one else alive bro..!< 😅
Someone else here remembered that he took one of these to prevent getting drunk in front of the crown prince. Maybe it absorbs harmful things?
And boy, he did. Through the >!prison’s door!< 😂😂😂😂
It wouldn't be complete without slapping someone. It has to be bursting + slapping to complete the effect
LMAO, what's for lunch!!? He def put in an act for sure. "Wait, another person wanted to talk, I supposed I'll just eat later"
Hahaha he should totally do that >!wink wink expression that he gave to Hwi after they were caught by Ga-On and Eunuch Hong running in the street!< 😉😉 

I would so watch TKA 2 with >!Hyun as the king!<
Yes 🙌  I adore her character in TKA so much more than DYLB. 😊😊 she’s great in both, but here in TKA, she is amazing. 😍
Probably because they only have an hour for this ep and it was between an extra minute or so of kissing by the sea or telling us the pill would save her LOL

Director chose sea 🤣
no i was hoping to have 1 episode of them just being **happy !!!** i think after all the angst and sadness, it would have been nice !
Yes!! I wanted more epilogue moments too ...
Samee 🙈
Yeah, definitely. I was already impressed by his acting in Extraordinary You and even more so in this one.
I don't know if our girl Ha-kyung was written with that much sass! She'd definitely be puzzled.

It's honestly hard for me to suspend belief that everybody thinks she's a he. Park Eun Bin is gorgeous! Same when I watched Sungkyunkwan Scandal with Park Min Young...
My bad, I was referring to the actor playing him 😂
Lol I was thinking the exact same thing then I kept going back like wait something is off lol but so glad she did that out of habit 🤍
PEB is the lead along with Kim Minjae, and it’s about the personal struggles of their characters. They both hit it out of the park and they have great chemistry. I felt it was worth my time but I don’t know if we prefer the same things. But it’s a romance, so the likely ending is kinda obvious if you were worried about that.
Same!!! Glad the grandma did that! Ol' dirty ass gnome should just rot lol ngl I wanted to see one more of his diva entrances 😂😂
It’s so fun reading the theories here as TKA aired, I still come back to read what people thought of the finale too. 🤩 thanks for sharing your thoughts!!
Lol he wasnt a grandpa in King2Hearts so lose his beard mustache and black hair
I was thinking that, too. Part of why I’m annoyed (not enough to dislike the episode, though!!) is because there were plenty of things they could have just said, oh, it was this!
I assumed the pill was something that would either nullify/decrease the efficacy of the poison or cause her to vomit immediately after. Med overdoses and accidental poisonings to things without known antidotes were often treated with "stomach pumping", charcoal, and induced vomiting and there are drugs that have antidotes that are totally different drugs often used for other things so since JE was a doctor and they had time to research the poison, they could have figured something out.
I’m inclined to think it was this, and all of the above theories.
Oh and also AsianWiki. I guess haters are just more vocal over those websites.

I remember reading a comment on asianwiki saying why are they portraying Ming in such a bad light, the show would be better if they did the opposite... i was like uhm maybe they should also know this is a work of friction and fantasy.
Oh boy, oops i didnt know it’s on BOLD (lol). 

I think the writer is trying to do character development for So-eun, as at the beginning , she didnt care about the people without title and because of Ji Woon, she changed and saw that everyone deserve to be treated the same. 


Il Wol knew that he was looking for Dami, and she went missing right after he went looking for her, so to avoid her suspicion about his connection with Dami’s disappearance, she needs to be eliminated.
I actually am really enjoying it but from the comments, there are some people that are just turned off about it because the main leads are a teacher and a student…at least just in the beginning & there’s no romance in the beginning either
Hahahaha, yah I also think it’s weird and possibly a plot hole since >!won san is too much of a genius asshat to do this sort of thing.!< If I were the writer, I would >!rather Hyun was searching for his brother after his miraculous recovery from near death and found the poems while rummaging through his belongings instead of having people hand deliver it to him.!< That would be more believable, I guess? 😊
Same!! And I never I would be that girl. It's fine, Hyun, you m'll find someone else someday 😭
Hahhaa! 😂
She eats a little golden treat right before instructing her handmaid to brew the poison tea. She said ji woon gave it to her a while ago to help with anxiety which is why she was taking it before meeting with her grandpa. This whole scene takes places as the handmaid thinks back on it and plans to hang herself.
It was also funny how no one went with him to Hwi. He was with Hyun, eunuch and lady Kim, but he went alone, fighting the guards by himself on his way to Hwi. Haha.
His grandest entrance so far 😆😆😆
Haha exactly 😂
Yes! Oh my gosh when he was sitting by himself staring at the horizon that was my first thought… when is Hyun getting his spin off to show how he has to get over the love of his life move far away to be with her husband and >!simultaneously get lumped doing a job he didn’t particularly ask for!< 😜
We really do need that sequel. The King’s Affection 2 would deal with the remnants of Sangheon’s “army” trying to gain power, and a queen search amidst the chaos.  

I’m honestly more inclined to have him pair up with Hakyung instead of Soeun if it had to be one of them, anyway Hakyung was >!granted a sort of annulment and her title back!<. But I’m sure some people would have something to say about the king being related to someone who supported Sangheon.

If I was an experienced AU author I’d actually try to write this for ao3, but I am not.
Currently watching Ghost Detective with PEB. So GOOD
I'm happy the director chose an extra minute of kissing by the sea! 🤣The director knew that everyone will go to forums to explain that the pill saved Hwi from the poison. Hahaha.
Exactly! This show needs to learn what balance is cause I've had heart palpitations for every episode 🙄😂
I just finished DYLB, I like it very much. Thanks for the recommendation.
oh interesting!! Might just give it a try, thank you!!
Honestly it felt like he needed someone to witness him and his pain and subsequent triumph, something he believe he rightfully deserved. Then he needed Hyun to know to stay out of the way, since he didn’t want to >!kill him!< but did want >!the crown more than his brother, Hyun’s life if it came to it!<
What an ending for my man.. oof
But I want to see PEB and Rowoon as well. 🤣 so demanding an audience, 🤪I know, but I really think this cast is too beautiful and they should come together as a fam if there ever was a season 2!
i get it ! in the last 2 episodes hyun came close to being killed TWICE !!!! that was so scary i wished they gave him more "happy" screentime !!
I’m glad. I started and finished the drama while in the middle of TKA so I have conflicted feelings between HwiWoon and JoonSong.  I still can’t decide which ship I liked better (currently leaning towards JoonSong).
Oh I agree! It’s not TKA without any trace of PEB and Rowoon. But for story reasons they can’t really appear too often, and anyway we’re here to watch Hyun grow into the >!wise but embattled king!< he is destined to be 😉
