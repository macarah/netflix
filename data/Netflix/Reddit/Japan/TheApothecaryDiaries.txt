This episode is just fascinating for what it sets up between Lakan and Maomao and what we get to know of Maomao herself. 


Lakan very obviously cares for Maomao. He wants her as his daughter, whatever that means, and at the very least he wants her safe and does not want to hurt her. We establish here that he is the kind of father to drink poison for his daughter. It is a very bold characterization decision.


It is also all sorts of interesting that Maomao so thoroughly beat him in his games in all the ways it matters. She beat him in the blue roses games last, and now she beat him in both playing with people and in Go. In the latter games, the piece that Maomao played which led to his downfall is his affection for her. For all of her ambivalence towards him, this ep showed us how thoroughly Maomao underetood Lakan's love for her.


These losses are doubly interesting because they juxtaposed against his first loss - that of against FengXian and how thoroughly losing ruined their lives.


I need to re-watch this ep, but this ep is soooo interesti g character-wise
I am relieved that he didn't rape her, like he implied to Jinshi 😵 but still, what an awful tragedy

I have to wonder if he ever tried to buy her out, and the madam wouldn't let him? Or was he trying to buy Maomao all along?
Do we get to see Fengxian's side of the story too ? like her perspective or is this it ?

Also does he know fengxian is still alive and is kept hidden ? 

I seriously want her to meet him now
Lakan can't handle a cup of liquor so he drinks lots of fruit juice --- I never would have thought that lol
What was that bit about finger slicing?? I didn't get
Life can be a tragedy of roses.
I don't understand this episode... What was the thing so horrible that Lakan did?
Was it getting her pregnant or giving her an STD? Because both looked plausible...so confused 🤷🏼‍♀️😒
I haven't even seen the episode yet but I **know** its gonna be peak.
Only one more episode left everyone DX Seeing the backstory being so well done is truly heart touching. Our Lakan gets explained:') He's honestly so pure in a way, its hilarious. Also the resemblance in Maomao from Fengxia. Ouf.
Nice use of the word ambivalence, considering it’s the name of the opening song. Agreed, was a fantastic episode.
> if he ever tried to buy her out, and the madam wouldn't let him? 

"she's gone"
The scene of madam beating him up with the broom is her not letting him get close to her, let alone buy her. As far as he knows, fengxian is no longer in vergridis house and might not even be alive (we know that she secret lives at the room in the back from past episodes, but he doesn't).
No, im afraid not. All speculations on her intentions. 
He does not know yet. 

You’ll find out the rest next week. 😢🥺
He is not aware she's still alive and hidden. More will be explained but we never get a direct fengxian perspective. But we get some glimpses >!the whole pregnancy was her plan, not just an accident. She though her price would drop and the next time he returned he'd be able to buy her. She never clearly told him any of that and he was stuck overseas for 3 years as you saw. Because of that, she thinks he just did all of that for sex once and abandoned her by not returning and by not answering the letters that we saw he didn't receive, so she hates him and kinda goes mad from that and syphilis. She then cuts off her own finger and baby maomao's to curse him!<
It has two meanings: 1.) it supposed to be for those who break their pinky promise ( i have read here that the one who broke the promise will have to slice their finger…)but fengxian did it to remind Lakan that he broke his promise to her. In her madness, she also send baby Maomao’s pinky fingertip in her attempts to send a stronger message to Lakan. 

2.) courtesan send their fingers to send their love for someone.
I think she was counting on him returning in 3 months like he had said earlier in his last visit to her. It looked like he wrote to her? But maybe she didn’t receive the letter or maybe she didn’t believe him, because either way, she had to endure and suffer A LOT because of his absence. It looked like she sent a lot of letters that he didn’t see until he returned, and you would think a normal family would’ve forwarded the letters to him, so from her perspective, he knew and he ghosted her and their baby
Lacking foresight to figure out Fengxian intention.

Not fault the way we the modern audience tend to think of it, but as shown it can have dire consequences.
He got her pregnant, which is something she also wanted out of the situation. She got STDs later on because her pregnancy lowered her value, and so she had to sell her body.
The horrible thing Lakan did was he got her pregnant and then went missing for 3 years "abandoning" Fengxian
It is obvious that she developed feelings for him, and of course, he did also. She knew what she was doing by letting him win the match. She knew he would ask her to sleep with him. The baby part was her own doing. She knew she would conceive. She also decided to keep the baby. What was so wrong in what he did? He was so dense that he didn't read the signs, very Lakan like. Not able to read social clues like a normal person would. Since she kept the baby, she had to take in customers maybe daily, and the contracted an std. If she had been honest with him from the start, maybe something could be worked out. But he did say that she was a proud woman, so her pride kept her from doing  so. Some anime watchers have been trashing Lakan, but these characters are well rounded, full of grays, and it is only our own point of view that can say who is good or bad in our own eyes.  All these characters have their own tragic stories.
[removed]
the “letting him win the match part” was not entirely right, actually the idea of devaluing her entered Lakan’s mind, but in the end lakan chose to play Go instead of shogi, which is fengxian will actually win, in a way, giving her the choice of what she wants to do. Further fueling to debunk the misconception that Lakan force her. 🤧😊🥺…okay back to crying for their lovestory…. You are so right with Lakan is not faultless but also it is not his intention.
She didn't really let him win as their hands met during the match and that's when they stopped the game to sleep together. She also kept the baby because she thought that they would start a family together with Lakan. Clearly that's what they both wanted but Lakan could not afford to buy her out since her value was getting higher and higher, so to drop her price she came up with the baby idea. Now Lakan could only afford to come by once every three months but as it turns out his uncle (Maomao's stepdad?!) made some kind of mistake and since they both were so close his family sent Lakan away as not to mud their name. Lakan thought that he would be back in six months but months turned to years. Once he did come home and saw all the letters Fengxian sent him he realized his mistake and rushed to the Verdigris House. Once there he was chased away by the old owner lady, she also told him that Fengxian is no longer there.

Now I suspect, that in the next episode he will be forced by Maomao to buy Fengxian out. Once he learns that she is still alive, he will happily do so.....

MaoMao’s adoptive father I think is Lakan’s unncle too and was fired for the death of consort AhDou’s son. That was 18 years prior, if I remember correctly and Maomao is 17. I also believe he came so late to the Verdigris because Lakan came back from overseas 3 years later. I also believe this is when he adopts her.
[removed]
Yes and to protect Lakan for more "Justice" revenge from this incident is why his father sent him off.

I don't know why they are making Lihua look extra milfy. 

She's barely 23.
Lady Liyue got the cake
Gyokuyou for me
Four words.  First word is the name of a deadly toxin.
Lihua with a side of Gyokoyuo for me, thanks.
Both, both are good
On one hand, Sarah Wiedenheft is one of my favorite anime VAs and always voices characters I enjoy.  

On the other hand, Lihua has the assets to "put a sausage between two buns"
Wheres the green haired woman tagts out of view
Becuase in the era of we-swear-it's-not-imperial-china where life expectancy is in the mid thirties, 23 is very well within MILF territory
But she is a milf, sadly the baby died but still counts.
Impacted on the wrong genshin
Even then, I would expect it to be in the late 20s, and NOT early 20s.

And surely the life expectancy is probably more than 30s.. probably going onto 40s and 50s.

Remember this is NOT based off medieval Europe. This is a similar to Medieval East Asia... which might NOT have had an average life expectancy as high as today BUT definitely far exceeds the Medieval Europeans.
Life expectancy is a difficult statistic. From birth, it might be low due to high child mortality. What you want is "given that someone makes past the age of 16, how long are they likely to live on average" and that is a MUCH larger number.
Mid 30? Wow that's 100 times worse then Medivel times.
Well I was curious about it and the results came betwoeen 23 and 35, but this is for the average population and given that we are talking about the immediate confines of the imperial palace it's probably higher, even significantly so, but regardless back then it wouldn't have been uncommon to be a mother at younger than 20.

The meta reason is as always hummina hummina big mommy milkers can smother me any day of the week
Here is the funny thing about AVERAGE life expectancy: If you lose many kids at birth or shortly thereafter it TANKS the average by a lot.

Surely even in medieval europe most people that got to their 20s and 30s often saw their 50s and 60s... if they didn't died in one of the many many wars.

Just calculate... let's say the oldest got to 70 and you have a child dying at birth... that is (70+0)/2 and around comes 35.

Now take a whole lot of kids that die before turning seven, many people dying between 20 and 40 because of... what I know... let's say wars and plagues and just a few that get up all the way to 60s and maybe 70. Surely the statistic say that the average is around 30.
I don’t have the time to find the data right now, but I highly doubt the average life expectancy of Ming China was significantly higher than 15th or 16th century Europe. That’s just a silly view of pre-modern Europe. Far more relevant to her life expectancy is her class and that fact that she’s already made it past childhood.
In Europe you would also go up to 50.
You can look at the average life expectancy of smokers vs non-smokers for that. Funnily enough most statistics say that on average(!) smokers live longer... just because you have to get to a certain age before you begin to smoke. So everyone that dies before that automatically counts as non-smoker and tanks the average for that statistic.

Ah... statistics are fun.
20 years old is old to have first child. During that time.

It's more like indentured servitude.  She has to work for him for a certain amount of time, but then she's free.  She says as much when she makes her bet with Lakan, that she'll live with him once her contract is up.
If someone buy a courtesan’s contract, it means the person is buying HER freedom. To do whatever she like being the person’s wife or mistress or caregiver or apprentice. Hmm…they technically don’t own the courtesan but it depends on their agreement. Most just want the courtesan’s freedom so they could be together.

Jinshi is just paying maomao’s debt to the brothel in exchange of a working contract.
He had her sign a work contract. Courtesans do the same, but the work contract involves a personal debt which is fatal (in practice) to default on. Maomao's contract is almost certainly just promising to work for Jinshi and not to pay a debt.

Disclaimer: I have no real knowledge of the historical customs. This is just my impression from the existing KNH material.
Jinshi did pay Maomao's debt to the brothel though.

&#x200B;

If I understood everything correctly (including your comment, English being my second language, I might have understanded it poorly), Maomao owed the Verdigris House a good amount of money. 

&#x200B;

That money mostly came from Lihaku, who was not rich enough to pay for Pairin's services and got them anyway because of Maomao's contacts. Basically, her little trip to town cost her a lot, because the old lady wanted her to repay Lihaku's bill. 

&#x200B;

That's what "Jinshi buying out Maomao" meant. He paid her debt and she was free to go and work for him instead of working at the brothel to repay the bill.
Maomao was charged for her upbringing - food and board. The Lihaku debt was an increase, certainly. The implication is that she has to make periodic payments or else the debt is "called" and she has to start working as a courtesan. She says that her severance pay provided her extra time. I assume she means future payments on the loan.

Jinshi did pay off her debt, necessary to free her from the brothel. But part of the deal - I am fairly sure - was that she sign his work contract.
Oh undoubtedly.

She'll resemble Fengxian so much when she's an adult, only with Lakan's eyes color.
Unpopular opinion but I personally find MaoMao even more beautiful than Fengxian 🤷 Fengxian’s still stunning af tho
I find it interesting that Verdigris House requires all the other women to have “certain assets” yet Fengxian & Maomao overcome that with their beauty & intellect (I only included MaoMao b/c The Old Lady covets her & wants to make her work there)
She is an adult though?
She’s a teenager, 17 to be exact & Jinshi is biologically 19 but he’s pretending to be older (Idk if that’s spoilers). We technically don’t stop growing until 25ish
Usually girls stop physically growing between 15-17 on the later end. 

It's things like your brain, skin, and wrinkles that continue growing beyond that age.

I've been watching the dub after watching the sub because I think the VA's do a great job (and sometimes I miss things reading subtitles because they go too quickly while I am trying to enjoy the art). The dub episodes for this series are 2 behind and come out on Saturday, so it's been up for a few days. The entire dub should be finished by April 6th.
Right I love the English dub  and can't wait to watch them  released  all

Might be slight spoilers since I'm not sure exactly how far the anime is, however:

>!She finds him creepy. The first time she saw him, she was a little kid with a random guy covered in blood coming towards her telling her to call him Papa (there's more context but you get the picture). The guy wasn't there for her as a father and in her mind, she has a father that did raise her, she isn't about to replace him. I think it's a loyalty thing. So she doesn't hate him, but is uneasy around him.!<
Here's what I see as the progression, based on the anime:

1. Maomao is adopted by her dad. Meets Lakan at some point growing up, and is turned off by him (either because he does something to warrant it or the ladies of the House influence her. Or both)
2. She knows he comes to *see her,* despite her avoiding him. This ups the dislike factor. (She may also know he's her biodad by this point as well)
3. This is the state of things until the blue roses challenge. Based on how Lakan described seeing the roses and how she achieved them, she realizes that Lakan was creating the roses for her mother. This shows a different side to this man she think just used her mom and ruined her.
4. This allows her to reframe his pursuit as something a *little* less creepy. She can rightfully guess that he doesn't mean her harm.
5. However, she doesn't necessarily like him, even if she can understand him. He honestly went the wrong way about everything.

So she probably knows he cares, but she hasn't shifted from her stance because he *has* been creepy towards her.
I think almost everything she knows about him is from what she learned from the old lady who runs the Verdigris House and the other courtesans who all hate him. They likely don't know why he disappeared for those three crucial years but would know all of the details of the fallout that it caused for Maomao's mom and the rest of the workers at Verdigris House (IIRC, it nearly put them out of business and it took a long time for them to recover). Her adoptive father could have said good things about Lakan, but it probably would have been more than offset by all of the bad things the women told her. And even he might not know why Lakan was away for three years, although it's possible that he knew that Lakan was sent abroad.
he's still a deadbeat father. yes he has his own struggles but doesn't change the fact that he wasn't there for her at all
Granny and her adoptive father believe the fall of Fengxian is solely his fault and they hate him for that. As the people closest to Maomao it obviously affected her view on him. Even though it is a whole misunderstanding.

Also he tries to be her father and she finds it creepy.
I believe the reason that she hates him is because she blames him for the condition of her mother. 

>!Among all of the other reasons why a daughter would resent an absent father, in this case, her mother was a courtesan and Lakan left once he had gotten her mom pregnant. That left her mother in a position of being worth almost nothing (how do you reduce the value of a courtsean?) which reduced her mother to the class of those who sleep with unclean in-off-the-street clients instead of high profile clients like before, ultimately leading to the infection!<
[removed]
Why do you assume she doesn’t know who he is to her ? Maybe she does and just don’t like him because he is a creep who wants to buy her
Man i just can imagine all those creeps once they found maomao mom becoming a street walker…its some bullcrap that granny pisses me off too.
Based on her reaction to him a few episodes ago with that super scary look, it seems more than uneasiness though right?
Another major reason why she doesn’t like him is JEALOUSY. He is one of the only people her adoptive father has praised outright. That is a BIG driving factor in how she feels about Lakan. She wants that.
Iirc she also tells Jinshi: What would you do if this guy appears suddenly in front of you and starts telling you to call him Papa. And Jinshi made a face. xD
[removed]
[removed]
What? the blue roses were about Maomao's mother? how come? I don't mind spoilers , feel free to tell me.
Yeah I agree with all that as well. It’s probably going to take awhile for Maomao to even consider having a familial relationship with Lakan.
Well, nobody allowed him a chance to be there in the first place.

Meh, as far as I can tell she just finds him creepy and doesn't want anything to do with him. She knows he's well meaning, but MaoMao isn't the most sympathetic person. The anime makes her out to be a bit more...lively? And empathetic? I guess that's one way to put it, but she's super apathetic to most things in the source. She's mostly just shown to care about her father, which tracks with how she is choosing to prioritize his feelings and place as her father over a relationship with her bio dad.
"Bio-daaaaad, you're *so* embarrassing, I don't want to be seen with you."
This is true but one important thing to note is that her super scary look came before Lakan helped her handle the guard during Jinshi’s purification ceremony. After that incident, she became more tolerable of him

It's not explicit, but heavily implied.

1. Lakan is the one who introduces the topic and says he remembers seeing them all the time
2. Jinshi investigates, and no one else recalls them
3. Maomao is willing to take it on: she knows it can be done
4. When she reveals the trick, she says that "someone with a lot of time" was watering roses with blue water, and that it was probably a man's trick to impress a woman (or something to that effect. I'm at work right now so can't check exact phrasing).

As Lakan is the only one who knew about the roses, it follows that Maomao would be talking about him at the end, since she's aware of who gave the challenge.
When I saw Lakan for the first time,
Seeing someone as high as Jinshi fear him,

I thought he could just burn down the whole pleasure town if someone ticks him off 🫠.
That was the initial reaction tbh.

Oh I got another interpretation of theses scenes.

I considered her mother as red roses because her eyes were red and she colored her nails red. He also connects her with the scent fur the polish.

I thought that Maomao might be the blue rose (or the love between rakan and fengxian) . Rare/impossible but a beauty. And she has rakans blue eyes. He never thought back then that there was a possibility of this love or child. And she was never close to him so she was impossible to reach. So the blue rose symbolizes this in Maomaos person. While the red rose stands for his love to fengxian.
You forgot to add that she gives him a dry blue rose at the end of last episode. This wasn't one of the ones she grew that stayed as buds and didn't fully open. Presumably not even enough time has passed for the roses she grew to be dry.
>!He can actually, he is very powerful if he wants to, but respects maomao’s decision in life, he just want to be somewhat near her and know she is safe…and ofc, his uncle is there in the pleasure house, so he won’t.!< 

She knows Lakan’s love for her and the story. She was sure she will win the bet because Lakan won’t allow her to poison herself and would drink anything she will give him. 😭
Same tooo, bruh the writing is soo good.

Looks like the same art style as the person who makes the (incredibly) gay historical soldiers/stereotypes as women comics.  In fact… https://twitter.com/CenturiiC/status/1754868201211482554?lang=en
Jinshi: We’ve been over this, MaoMao! Hallucinogens will lead to the ruin of this country!

<Chinese History Readers> 💀💀💀
#jinshi we need to cook jinshi
Looks like she took some too
This way, when Britain comes around, they have no clientele to sell to…
Maomaoburg
It is from Centurii.
i dont use twitter, as i take showers daily
That was a reference to the Opium Wars, 100%
Neither opium nor meth are hallucinogens tho. Opium is a depressant and meth is a stimulant.
Don't know what the fuck showers has to do with twitter but aye at least the art is entertaining.
Totally something Maomao would counter with. Good Job!
i just hate twitter
Then you should have said you don't use twitter since you don't like it instead of insulting tons of people.
i just said i shower daily
By saying you don't use twitter and shower daily, your implying people who do use twitter do not shower daily. You may not be doing that intentionally but it's very much how you come off.
It was intentional.
So your an asshole lol don't fuckin gaslight people man.
Take a shower and calm down.
My man I'm probably a lot calmer than you are. lol
Ok champ 😂

It's such a weird hate-on for a character that seriously doesn't deserve it and has an actual mental disability of which they have turned into a strength.
People hate on lakan so much not realising he didn’t do anything that wrong , 

Lakan was born without able to recognise people . Started to like and hangout with his uncle . 

because luoman was banished lakan got punished , couldn’t see or marry the girl he loved and wanted to see his daughter but got beaten and cursed by people . 

Mamao hated her birth mother and kinda fixed that blame onto lakan for ditching her . And she bonded with luoman and doesn’t want same bond with anyone . Lakan eccentricity makes people blind to his pain .
I hope i see more of those its hella fun to see them u turn
Tbf, Maomao would call him sperm donor rather than father also. 

Lakan is such a sad character though, I cred during yday's episode.
As someone who never knew her (biological) father: I get this... I refer to that person (my "father") in a similar manner.
I don't think they are wrong for not wanting to use the tittle "father". Being addressed as father isn't a given, you need to earn it.

People who have contact with their biological parents don't seem to understand this. I refer to my biological father by his name or as a sperm donor. He did nothing for me so he doesn't deserve the "title". He isn't my "father".

Not referring Lakan as Maomao's father isn't wrong, because Maomao already has Luomen.
One the one hand: yes. On the other he was (because of one way or the other) never really a father for Maomao, so does he deserve the title? I agree that these words may be a bit harsh... but for Maomao he wasn't much more than the man who got her mother pregnant.

There is a saying that I find quite fitting here: "Becoming a father is easy. BEING a father is much much harder."

Edit: And even to her mother Maomao has a... tense relationship to say the least. Seeing the graces, the old apothecary and the old lady more as family than her own blood, because these were the people who raised her.
I mean, all we anime onlies had was his creepy attitude and maomao’s intense reaction to the mere mention of him (without even using his name), I also hated his ass before this episode.
Saying Lakan did nothing wrong is incorrect, IMO. Even he knows he messed up. That's the entire reason he wants to connect with Maomao; to atone.

He and Fiangxen were caught in the throes of passion and made a huge mistake. Then, when Luomen was kicked out, he wasn't brave enough to fight back against his father for the woman he loved. He absolutely made at least a few huge fuckups. But that's the point. What makes you a great man isn't your ability to not mess up. It's your ability and drive to fix your mistakes. It's your ability to become great in spite of your shortcomings.

As Hugh Beaumont Nuetron might say, "We all make mistakes in the heat of passion, Jimbo."
I am not criticizing anyone.

Just seeing fans take a "u turn" after just an episode is kinda hilarious. That's all. (Not to mention, I am no different.)
Luoman was the reason that he couldn’t be there for mamao and her mother . How comes luoman gets off scot free and lakan gets all the blame .
Right. Before I read ahead, I thought LaKan did something horrible to Maomao's mother. With how she acted around him, it made perfect sense.
[removed]
I too find the u-turn hilarious but I have seen some people get really annoyed and hissy about the fact that not all of us think lakan as Maomao's *father*.
Well, to be fair, Luomen's dismissal and exile was not his fault either. Just the unjust consequences of political bickering and shenanigans in the Palace and the royal family.
Luomen didn't do anything wrong. Those were just the times.
I am fairly sure Loumen would have been more than fine to hand over Maomao to Lakan if he came asking for her. 

The Madam was the biggest blocker.

I meant he was the cause not like he intentionally did anything wrong to be indicted or punished but he gets all sympathy from mamao and all hatred is pushed onto lakan and this goe further and further in light novels .

“Then, in the course of much negotiating with the old madam and over some ten years, he had successfully paid off an amount of money equivalent to two times the damages.” 

Lakan paid damages to madam for ten years he has no obligation to . He continued to visit brothels for ten years and madam out of her spite told him fengxian was dead .and continued to beat him .

And as for Louman

“while her old man was compassionate, he did grasp the broader situation, and he never tried to stop the old madam from chasing the other man out of the brothel with her broom. He knew that wrong was wrong”

And he watched getting Lakan beaten for 10 years and this implied to mamomao then he was a bad man . He despite knowing never told Lakan that fengxian was alive
[removed]
Because Lakan still did something stupid.   
Even if she didn't keep Maomao, he still devalued a princess. That was a big deal in that era.   
Then he was foolish enough to not think twice of what she was really saying in her letters about "the deal getting cancelled".   
He was young and did a mistake. She didn't tell him earlier correctly so he didnt grasp the entire plan.   
And then got sent away. (not his fault, but Fengxian and the madam couldn't know his circomstances, hence both of their reaction/actions)

I don't know if Luomen knew both side of the story, he might've missed some details from Lakan since he couldn't see him anymore either. And knowing his personnality, he wouldn't push anyone to any conclusions himself. Even Maomao acknoledges his defaults. Still loves him cuz he could actually care for her and teach / educate her. Would've Lakan been able to be something else than be a doting father letting her become a spoiled brat?! (ok big speculation cuz he might've taken Luomen in too and Luomen might've been the one educating correctly the both of them..)

Don’t ya dare tempt me to watch dub
The dub is very good

WATCH IT!!!
The VA is Go/jo's voice actor, also what is the problem with the dub? I've watched it in sub and dub, and the dub is better for hearing the emotion IMO.
It really is.  

Although hearing Ciaran Strange's voice come out of somebody with huge tits is kind of weird since they usually only voice dudes...
I only said it for the memes . Tho yeah the dub is pretty good
Go/jo's pronouns are sat/oru. Please don't disrespect him

This is phenomenal, well done!

For those unaware, the original image is from the movie “The Princess Bride” it’s considered a classic and has a wide fan base. It’s fairly family friendly (there is light violence, sword fighting mostly) and it’s definitely worth the watch.
Inconceivable!
I swear to god i was thinking the same thing when i was watching it
And Lakan would fall for it again just so he could play with Maomao again.

Pleeeaaaassseeee give us a season 2, anime lords 🙏🙏🙏
A recap episode for the finale would be the ultimate troll
If there’s no season2 we riot!
Please let this be a special 1 hr episode. There is sooo much to unpacked in 20 minutes. 😅🥰
Oh noooo. This cannot be the finale. I need at least 25 more episodes 🥺😭
So is this just like a sum up episode it is ok I think episode 23 was really good tho so I can live with that
she's soo prettyy
They gon make it 2027
I hope to god it’s not a recap episode
Agreed!
Yes please where do we march
I guess this is a slight spoiler, but >!it isn't a recap episode, it showed past events to not spoil it!<


*Typo
This is going to cover the epilogue to vol. 2, what that entails idk. I’m a bit surprised it’ll be a full episode, but maybe parts of the last chapter also remain to be animated.
How do you know?
Well I only saw one thing that might have been that builds up the story everything else was what had happened so far I only saw spoiler>! The dance!<
Studios love to start animating once all the hype has died down and engagement is gone
It depends though. Kimi No Todoke is getting another season this year, the last one came out in 2011. Spy fam season 2 came out in a year. It's silly to wait till the hype dies down, especially when there is already a ton of source material available.

He let her recover in his bed, which is a much nicer (and healthier) place than the clinic. And he wouldn't do that for *anyone* else. But a conspiracy against the Imperial Family is about as big a crime as you can have, so Jinshi goes into examiner mode from the start. He was probably both scared personally and uncertain if Maomao was mixed up in this business somehow, which would be lethal for her.
I just watched this scene 2 days ago. I interpreted it as he was in shock. He was more concerned about her well being than thanking her at the moment cuz she looked really rough and she just passed out. Like she was badly injured. What really bugged me was that he didn't perform first aid on her, like at least bandage her leg with cloth or something instead of letting her bleed all the way out.
His gratitude shows through his actions rather than words: carrying her by hand to the infirmary and later his room despite their status difference, constantly worrying about her wound, allowing her to sleep in his bed, ordering Gaoshun to keep an eye on her at all times so that she doesn’t reopen the wound, getting her immediate help when she does reopen it, etc. In terms of the historical setting, this actually is quite representative of what would’ve happened since she is officially just a servant (although anyone else in his position wouldn’t have given this much consideration to her). Servants were viewed as literal trash back then and anything they do for their master is considered to be duties rather than acts worth rewarding. (Jinshi certainly views her as the opposite of trash and doesn’t even think of her as a servant, but this atmosphere of society would explain why he was so formal with her right after she woke up while Basen and others were in the room. His true feelings for her and her actions were clear in the way he looked at her and held her face right after she saved him). The author sticks strictly to this atmosphere and has a tendency to have the characters show their affection to each other through their actions rather than their words.

I personally would’ve preferred him to pull her into a hug when they’re alone and whisper “thank you” in her ear the way he did when he was high off that aphrodisiac but certain people in this fandom might accuse him of sexual assault if he does 🙄 Also random sidenote that we’ve sadly never actually had an instance of these two being alone together ever since the incident 🙃 

Also regarding your question on who did it, that’ll only be revealed in season 2 if we get one
I didn't read the LN2 but neither in the English nor in the Japanese dub has he ever thanked her. However he does show he cares so in some way by these small looks and expressions of concern I guess  he did as much as Maomao would feel acceptable and normal as she acknowledged him being concerned for her wellbeing. If you remember she mentioned it in the episode with the blue roses. Hope this helps if I am wrong I will stand corrected
His gratitude is through his actions. The concern he shows for the injury to her leg, him carrying her out of there. I don't recall ever seeing him thank her but his actions spoke louder than words.
It's probably just the author blanking out and forgetting. 

Jinshi is pretty emotionally invested in the safe keeping of servants so it is strangely missing. Nothing to do with station or protocol as far as I can tell. 

There's really nothing stopping him once Maomao revealed the reasons for said incident.
Interesting way of looking at it. It would be interesting to see that play out.
Oh yeah wanted to add. I think some people in the Chinese culture think that thanking people makes them more distant:

https://www.quora.com/Do-Chinese-people-say-thank-you-when-someone-does-something-for-them#:~:text=Yes%2C%20expressing%20gratitude%20is%20a,the%20kindness%20or%20help%20received.

So I think it's like no need to thank those that are really close to you.
This is what I was thinking as well, but I still felt personally slighted or like I was missing something because she wasn’t even phased and her saving him wasn’t addressed. I think I’m leaning towards your explanation
Couldn't have said this better myself.
My thing is the writer could have forgotten, but once it’s set to air on a show there are many more writers and many more story editors trying to make sure that simple things like this are tidied up. Idk we’ll see.
I believe it's also because there are levels to the thanks denoted by different phrases and I'm assuming someone of his stature would not use the less distant phrases as the phrases are also more colloquial, hence would not be in his vernacular
Hmmm very interesting point

Accurate 🤣🤣🤣
It's always funny to see a noble figure making all for having the heart of a common who don't care of him (and develop feelings for him/her in same time 🤣)
It's them, alright! The male is trying so hard, and the female is literally examining the plant life lmao!
I see no difference 😂
Yeah so true.

Gotta keep in mind what Maomao wants though: to be left alone, go unnoticed, (and dose herself with poison).  

To some degree, she's already living her dream - access to stuff she normally would never have access to, a wealthy patron bankrolling her lifestyle, and freedom from the life of a courtesan.
I am!!! I’m sooo effin pressed about this! The soldier gets a reward for a small heroic acts >!Lady suiren was named legendary for saving Queen dowager and current emperor once and maomao who practically saved the imperial family again and again…plus the nation(in the future)!< didn’t get any amazing reward. I know she doesn’t need recognition…but we know maomao is very willing to accept gifts as compensation. 😅

The emperor would just dismissed it as >!oh, as expected with Lakan’s daughter or “oh, you are indeed La clan”!< WTH!!! Wdym by that!? Give her a greenhouse and medicinal herbs, emperor! 🤣😂

Seriously tho, maomao is basically a >!commoner by choice!<, if you think about it, so I know she may not like a palace or be treated soooo highly before. >!tho now, she has no choice but just accept!<

It was later revealed that the emperor >!didn’t get the seriousness of the poisoning/bullying/abuse/scheming happening inside in the rear palace, he seemingly, dismissed it simply women’s play fights!< so maybe thats the reason he didn’t see the need to fully compensate her as Jinshi should handle that.
She is 100% being under appreciated. All the appreciation she’s gaining is really through Jinshi’s hidden affections for her. At first I thought it was insanely unfair, but after watching a few CDramas, I’ve noticed it’s actually the norm in historical China. A servant’s existence is solely for their master. Even if they are unjustly sacrificed for their master, the deed is simply viewed as “a servant doing their job” rather than “a person losing their life”. Their life really is practically worthless as MaoMao herself has said. Still unfair af though. I personally really wish we got some more scenes of Jinshi panicking about MaoMao’s injury at least to clearly show how their relationship was impacted by her sacrificial actions for him as well as some serious official recognition by the emperor for her deeds despite the setting’s protocols
She’s just a commoner. No amount of deeds can change the class one is born into
I think Jinishi definitely appreciates her. But she's rather aloof towards him and also doesn't seem to have any ambition, so trying to give her overt rewards might be counterproductive. She'd probably like to keep a low profile no matter how large her achievements are and Jinshi is cognizant of that. He seems to have a close relationship with the emperor and I would guess that the emperor generally defers to Jinshi in regards to how Maomao should be treated or rewarded (but that's just speculation on my part).
As others have said; she's a commoner. The bar for her is much higher than those of higher standing, and she wisely shyes away from attention in the first place. If people with more power than her thought she was showing them up, she could land in real hot water. 


Honestly I think the way she's shown appreciation is the amount of freedom and trust she's given by those she's helped and beyond. I had a big gap between the first cour and catching up with the second, and on picking it up again I was caught off guard by how relaxed and unguarded Maomao spoke compared to the beginning. 


It's highlighted by how Maomao's mouthing off to the Outer Court Ladies is paralleled with the reaction she gets from mouthing off to that guard. It's a stark reminder of her status.
[removed]
Get this girl a science lab and an herb garden and she'll never ask for anything more in her life.
That’s not quite true, when we’re in a setting like the court of Imperial China in which the scholarly civil exam system or the eunuch directorates allowed quite a large potential mobility if one excelled in either path. But Maomao being a woman and officially lowborn can only be rewarded so much.
I like this, I'm sure Jinshi knows Maomao doesn't want any fanfare..however, I don't she'd mind her own private greenhouse or two 🤣 she deserves more than that, lol!
>He seems to have a close relationship with the emperor and I would guess that the emperor generally defers to Jinshi in regards to how Maomao should be treated or rewarded (but that's just speculation on my part).

That's actually a really good point.

Maomao "works" for Jinshi, even when she's working for Gyokuyou, Jinshi is in charge of the affairs of the inner palace and so the buck stops there.

The emperor can acknowledge Maomao's contributions, but it's ultimately up to Jinshi to provide sufficient rewards.

And he knows what motivates her!  TCM ingredients.  Rare ones.  That cordyceps he used to get her to sign a new contract at the end of the first cour?  [That shit's expensive.](https://www.amazon.com/Himalayan-Cordyceps-Sinensis-Caterpillar-Cordyceps/dp/B0BNG6C2T9) The ox bezoar that she's losing her mind about getting?  That's *expensive as hell.*    ($200 a kilogram for the lowest grade, up to $165/gram for the highest grade.  eBay has a single high grade one up for sale for $1500 right now.)

Those kind of ingredients aren't readily available to commoners, but he's happy to use his connections and money to get them for her.  (Or try to, anyway.  Has had no luck so far in the anime.)

This scene brings me to tears nearly everytime, their love is real, beautiful and something to strive for.
Her slight shake of her head as in "I can't believe this is actually happening" is a work of genius. Truly a great moment, and if Gyokuyou is a bad person for feeling jealous, then so are we all.
I love their story <3
[removed]
I think it was her saying that she stayed "pure/innocent", as the guys seemed to have asked a question, but there was just simply no dialogue. But your interpretation is a beatiful as well
That's one thing I think ppl don't get abt jealousy is that it's an preventable emotion, but it's important to be mindful and open about it. I don't blame gyokuyou for being jealous because she's 1 of the 4 concubines (or rather, 3, given how the Emperor feels about the fact that lishu is a concubine) and not the emperor's only. She yearns to be someone's only.
Me too, definitely in my favorite top 3 moments

That makes sense, but it would be a bit rude of him if that's his first question. I can see her volunteering that info just to get the issue out of the way.
I don't really think he said it, he probably was about to, and then she shook her head, as she knew that was what he wanted to ask.
Tbh, I would ask it politely, I'm not exactly socially "normal" though
Ok, I like that!

I would think the most natural recommendation for fans of Kusuriya would be *House MD*.
Cool! I might check it out one time. 
Kinda unrelated but I started to write a kinda similar story as well (though it is meanly just a feel good,romance story) that I might publish, if I find a site where I can put it
Tibet is now part of China also known as People's Republic of China that next to India, Afghanistan,  Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar/Burma. 🇨🇳

Literally SAME! This show actually managed to replace another anime that I loved for years. I’ve seen so many romance shows but never in my life thought I’d find another one that I’d become this obsessed with 😍 Just thinking about it makes me happy and I think about it every day 🥰 I have a problem 😩
I'm really happy that the animation studio knocked it out of the park.  It's not just "a good adaptation" - it's a great anime in its own right that has beautiful visuals, stunning music, and has been carefully planned out for maximum impact.
Yeah, it’s not my all-time favorite but I watched 5x over as well lol watch! Start with the new dub, last week episode, and the new one
[removed]
What was the other anime you liked ???

Inuyasha 😄 Kagome and Inuyasha were my literal life for so long but seeing how Jinshi’s even more loyal to MaoMao and has an even wider personality range, I think I like him even more 🤭 (I still love InuKag though!)

Love it
Really nice ^^
All the red is from Jinshi's nosebleed from seeing this 🤣
Also, he would have a heart attack from seeing her stomach, since most women didn’t show that much skin during those times 😅😂

None of the plants or mushrooms are shown by accident.
I figured as much! This and the attention to detail are some of the reasons I love this show. Also given the way the flower takes up the entire screen  makes me think it will be a major player later on

Yes!!!
The VA did a great job!
Is this in the dubbed version? Because in the subbed version, he deliberately doesn’t call her by her name because there’s a big future scene in the written version (which will be aired in season 2 if a season 2 happens) where he uses her real name for the first time

And yes I loved this scene as well
Not really.

Jinshi has to be in careful to observe his station, especially since he's operating incognito so unless under special circumstances, he can't afford a fraternal slip up.
Yeah that was cute

Also as the episode ended I was swearing at my computer so much my neighbor knocked on my door asking what was wrong
I watched English version of this scene and both VA's did a great job.
[removed]
In the English version he whispers MaoMao.

I personally loved the way they ended this episode
Really love that we saw how Lakan sees the world.
I am not sure how it was intended to be received, but it gave off really big Prosopagnosia vibes.

IMO, it felt like he genuinely couldn’t control how he sees people, rather than ‘people are just pawns and objects to me.’ 
And it’s huge that he sees Maomao’s and Fengxian’s faces clearly. 

So fucking amazing.
I love the anime adaptation.
I probably won't understand until I rewatch but what did lakan mean by "the challenge ended in a failure"...like failure for him or overall
I’m confused as to why Jinshi felt like he had to find blue roses in the first place… is it because he doesn’t want Lakan to expose him or?
Ok, can someone please explain to me why Jinshi or Miao Miao even gaf about Lakan's blue roses?  


I know this story is about palace intrigue and complicated political/interpersonal relationships but why did Jinshi ask Miao Miao to practically move Heaven and Earth to make blue roses out of season instead of just saying,  


"oh, blue roses? cool story bro"  


What am I not seeing?
My son and I feel like Gaoshun's voice js different. Definitely sounds like maybe it's a totally different VA... Anybody else?
Am I just going crazy or did the animation seem a little off in this ep? I may be hallucinating.
Does anyone know why some people call Mao Mao Shao Mao?
Same.
That image of everyone around Lakan being Go pieces and then Mao mao suddenly appearing out of nowhere was just beautiful cinematography. I'm so curious about their relationship with each other now. It seems like Mao mao is a significant exception to Lakan's worldview and I'm so eager to find out what that means.
Had the same question. It was never explained why he feels compelled to do anything this guy tells him to? I don’t think he outranks him.
You are not, it had less quality. I also felt it was a wasted chapter: the blue roses stuff was anecdotic, not meaningful enough for a whole chapter. On the other hand, they resolve Maomao's laid off from the Inner Palace, Jinshi's depression, their reconciliation and his buying back her from Madame in a very plain and rushed chapter (12). Timing is everything in adaptation.
Its Gaoshun's petname for her, Xiaomao. Means, little mao.
I do feel like as a watcher I’ve been thrown around a bit. It’s getting confusing keeping up with everything. One minute she’s working for Jinshi and the next she’s back as a poison taster, and I genuinely can’t remember when she was brought back to the Inner Palace and why. I hope the pacing becomes a little better, because aside from that I still really love the show.
you nailed jinshis utter shock and maomaos delight lmfao, its great :D

I only wish I had a hairpin to give!
So cute! 🥰
Amazing you look just like her !!!
That's a very good cosplay! Have you found some harpins of quality to pair? I have only seen some los quality wish/AliExpress stuff, nothing for actual use
Amazing! Fantastic work
OMG so kawaiiiii! 😍

Did you make the entire set? Can you like share the details/patterns pretty please? 🙏🏻🥺
Aww, thanks! :)
💗💗💗
Do you mean the hairpins at my waist? I don’t think so, I made two out of three of those (the pearl and twig ones)! The silver one isn’t exactly the same as the anime one either, but hopefully close enough.
Thanks! I’m afraid I can’t even if I wanted to. I researched and sourced parts of Maomao’s hanfu (historical Chinese clothing) across different dynasties and did a lot of hand sewing for the pieces to fit me.
Those are really cute! Was wondering if hand made. As I have very long hair I was searching for options to make my hair, and I know it may be culture apropiation but have always found hairpins cute, so I was searching for some traditional ones. Noche cosplay tho, very attentive to detail

IIRC the party is actually Lihaku’s, but orchestrated by Gaoshun (and I suspect Suiren) to have Jinshi and Maomao run into each other.
The party isn't at Jinshi's mansion or MaoMao likely would have learned who it was. Also a eunuch arranging that sort of party would have been a little suspicious. So it was probably one of his friends arranging the party for him. The other reply suggests the LN had the specifics.
I guess I was just lost in this episode, they had a layoff but I was totally lost as to why she didnt want to be let go. Anyone have any info by chance?
The fact that they helped plan it isn’t talked about enough 😭 Gaoshun’s the king wingman 🥹
Lihaku would not have been able to afford to pay for the three princesses to entertain his friends in a mansion that had so much expensive stuff though 🤔
I think, as Maomao said Lihaku was the intermediarie to get the VHouse. But I am under the impression it could be Gaoshuns state. Maybe that's why they had only young military men around. That way Jinshi wouldn't look out of place. 
Gaoshun had Lihaku act as a go-between, and at this point Maomao didn’t know Jinshi’s mansion yet
She didn't want to be fired because she'd have to go to work for the madam to pay off her debt... But she didn't communicate her desire to stay well enough for Jinshi, who thought she wanted to leave 🙃
It is most likely that the name on the bill is Lihaku, but the funding is from Gaoshun.
Ah that makes a lot of sense! Thank you so much for explaining
👀 how devious, haha
You're very welcome! 🩵

The first time I saw Maomao’s reaction when Jinshi asked if she was okay with meeting Lakan, it went by so fast that I went back to replay it at 0.5x. I was beyond horrified and regretted it 🥹
I just watched this, and it really stunned me as a narrative choice. Ooh they really are father and daughter.
He is obviously going to punish the soldier who hit his daughter.  He is pissed and you don't want to piss off Lakan

I wonder if we'll see her mom give this glare at some point as well.
Yeah he is very NOT THERE when the walk away starts

Her mom is so out of it now with the syphilis that I'm not even sure if she has enough personality left for it. It'd be an interesting choice for sure though.
They could show it in a flashback.

The large facial features give your work a distinct style. I also quite like what you’ve got going on in the second pic! It’s like she’s in a post-poison haze
Her head is way too small given how her face is drawn
Thx! I tried doing something unique, it didn't work out as well as I've imagined, but I'm glad you like it! 😊 I'll try to do better next time! Are there any things I should improve upon?
I'll try to do better next time!
You could consider working on light and shadow! I read in your other comment that you don’t have much control over your shading tool and you sound like you have a vision. You know what you’re after but you’re limited by your tools, so depending on the software you’re using I’d try to see if there are any tutorials for light and shadow studies out there.

Above all don’t be too hard on yourself :) Sometimes the good thing about being new to an art form is having that very fresh perspective on what you think is interesting. Always take what others say with a pinch of salt, and keep looking at artwork that inspires you – it’ll help you refine your own visual taste <3
I'll be looking forward to it!
Thank you! I'm not exactly new to art though. I just usually do traditional ( on paper) pieces, which I'm better with. I'm trying to get better at digital, so that I can make my comics. I'll try to find any tutorials on doing lighting in Krita (it's what I use) and/or maybe if there are any free additional brushes for me to use for that. 
Thank you for your kind words and feedback! 😊
Thx! Are there any other problems with it, that I should pay attention to?
Sure. Her neck is too long, and the shading on it makes it look like someone was trying to choke her to death. The shading around her lips is a bit weird, like she has just eaten some PB and j and got it all over her mouth. and the shape of her eyes look a bit weird. Ofc it can be chalked up to style but they look a bit too rhombic. Try to see how her eyes are normally drawn in the show.
Okay! I'll try to improve those! Her eyes are mainly a victim of my line control being bad on my device. The shading is like that, becaude I only had 2 shading options on the app, sadly. I'll try to improve!

Come to the dark side & get into subs. 👹
The dubs are on a 2- week delay from the subs. It releases every Saturday.
Every Saturday
About 10 11pm UK time on a Saturday.
I can't. I have tried with numerous things, not just anime, and for whatever reason, I retain zero  information. I can't listen to audiobooks either. My brain is just wired weird. 😐
Thank you!
Well… I was mostly saying that for the double entendre (hehe) but I completely understand… I mostly watch dub but when I get desperate I watch sub and I’ll have to pause it/rewind it if I didn’t catch something (the adhd is strong).

Literally the cutest thing ever 🥹 and then he gets mad when Lihaku also calls her a cat 🤣
I noticed that too! So adorable, he thinks of her as his little cat 😂❤️
I love when gaoshun says xiaomao 🥹 so adorable and it fits because she’s so smol and curious like a cat too
maomao is cat
This is such a well leveled picture of a screen 💀
Wait until he releases that everyone calls her cat cause it is a *really* low hanging nickname for someone named Catcat.
It makes him sound so fatherly, it's adorable
OMF you’re so right😭 i didn’t even notice
I do wonder how they reconcile their names being in Chinese, while speaking in Japanese. Or maybe he thinks maomao is actually demonkingdemonking?
Japanese borrowed a lot of Chinese words, both the spelling and especially the writing. But in my headcannon they just speak Chinese tbh.

Same. 

Was waiting to see the fallout (what happened to that guard?!?!) but we’ll probably only find out much later.
The way he responded after she asked for the beezor broke me. He was so kind and gentle.
i absolutely loved the pacing of this episode :3
I loved that episode, but I was grimacing so hard when he put his hand on her face. It must hurt AS HELL, and she doesn't even flinch...
Okay, I gotta, be honest... That episode is amazing and I love it, but I can't not hear the Taco Bell dong noise when Maomao gets smacked and sent flying...
I wish I could just give Maomao a hug. Poor thing has gone through so much in life and yet has turned out to be a spectacular human being. In every way.
Jinshi really does look younger in those scenes, come to think of it. It's because of the hair, I think.
The way he softly cradled her in his arms and walked out so regally. OH LORD.
Toooooo many to count
Has the song at the end of the ep come out on Youtube yet?
I've watched it so many times, my roommate begged me to find something else to watch 🤭
I’m glad I’m not the only one 😅
Okay, I got a question about this episode — why did the plan include stealing the ceremonial tools? They’re still gone, too, right? No one said anything about finding them. They weren’t for _this_ ceremony?
[removed]
I imagine he's either a bit shorter than he was, or he's enjoying his new assignment in the most remote place on the entire Empire....
She didn’t flinch because he did it so gently
[Here](https://youtu.be/Jew4uraCjNk?si=l3VpGjPjJOZ2eTte)!

Edit: and this is the [lyric](https://youtu.be/qz5F4vpc0_Y?si=EM9WC4ozROcoHx8Z) version
The ceremonial tools (intended to hold up the pillar) were stolen so that the craftsman (the deceased father of the three fighting brothers in a previous episode) would have to build new ones. It’s not exactly clear who built the stolen ones, but the one to build the new ones would need to be the craftsman because it was needed on short notice. The issue with asking the craftsman to build it is this particular craftsman’s method of creation: mixing metals in a ratio that would cause the metals to melt at a lower temperature. So the new ritual tools that this craftsman makes would melt more easily by simply being near an open flame than other ritual tools would. Because they used this deceased craftsman’s tools, the tools melted while being above the heated pot during the ritual ceremony and the pillar collapsed, nearly crushing Jinshi.

The person who stole the ceremonial tools and later asked this craftsman to build these ritual tools was Suirei, and the reason she asked him is because she knew about his secret creation method and knew that using his tools during the ceremony will lead to Jinshi’s death. Her motivation in killing Jinshi will only be revealed if there’s a second season

I really needed the gratification of seeing him get punished 😭
I was thinking the palace would be getting itself a new eunuch
Thank you!!
Ah, that makes sense, and explains why the craftsmen flashed up on screen.

When I hear “ceremonial tools” I’m thinking censers, bowls, and such, so this always confused me. Thanks for clearing it up.
Possibly by hand
With a rusty chainsaw?

Kamuro are usually older than that (while they can start of young, they are considered kamuro until they start serving customers so they will usually be in their early/mid teenage years).

I don't think she sleeps with them but I wouldn't be surprised if she sexually harasses them though. But due to the nature of a brothel, this wouldn't be seen as strange or viewed the way it would in modern society. It would just be viewed as annoying.
Was this mentioned in the anime?
Mao Mao should invent viagra or something to keep prairin in control xD

ahh i see! that’s interesting. 

yeah potentially! maomao said in today’s episode that prairin seduces anyone when she feels like she hasn’t received enough pleasure, and they showed prairin with a little girl. so she most likely pressures them into unwanted sexual activities. but yeah, they definitely wouldn’t bat an eye at that at the brothel.
yes, in the most recent episode!
prairin needs to take whatever jinshi took two episodes back to keep his masculine urges at bay😭

This might sound weird…but It’s also part of the training for the kamuro… maomao also mentioned she was also practically trained by pairin in the arts of courtesan.

It was also mentioned that maomao would almost cry, during her training with her pairin-neechan until she perfected her techniques.(implying some g2g actions)
Oh, kk. Thanks.
They mentioned that it doesn't work on women
that’s such a good point! i completely forgot about that omfg
>It was also mentioned that maomao would almost cry, during her training with her pairin-neechan until she perfected her techniques.(implying some g2g actions)

Wait when was this???
LN 5 epilogue. That famous epilogue.
Oh sorry thought you were talking about the anime. Because I know the bit youre talking about and i woulda REMEMBERED seeing that in the show ....

It's not obvious in the episode, but in the LN basically someone explains to Maomao that the minister didn't think she was serious and went over and tried it himself, if you pause the scene in the anime, you can see he has collapsed in front of where Maomao was sitting.
I'm guessing that most tasters who get poisoned collapse twitching. Maomao smiled, got up and walked out. Idiot minister probably thought "drama queen!" and wanted to score points with the big guy. Bad move.

Although you do wonder about someone trying to poison a consort with a fast acting poison. Given how quickly the minister collapsed, it would never have reached its target.
I think the minister simply couldn't believe Maomao when she said it was poisoned, and looking ok. He thought she was bluffing, so he decided to have a little taste for himself. Because normally, what is expected is that if the food-taster ingests the poisonous food, they would collapse into a fits and probably be foaming at the mouth, suffer nerve damage. That was probably the expectation that the minister had about Maomao... thinking she was just bullsh\*\*\*\*.
The minister thought Maomao was lying and ran to the bowl she tasted, not to any other. The minister was near, as well as all the high bureaucrats and military officials. According to the anime he was sitting near Lihua, you can see he stands up and runs to Maomao's former place (chapter 6, minute 13:44), which must have been very near in the Consorts' zone, since she was supposed to taste Gyoukuyou's bowl.
It seems in the anime they speeded up his fall, maybe too much.

Nah, there's a lot of anime before 8.8 and 9.1. This is just seasonal, and there's no way the Apothecary Diaries will exceed 9.09. It's not because our anime is not good; there's the beast sitting at 9.09, which is Full Metal Archemist with a fandom that likes to write bad reviews in every anime that beats theirs. The Apothecary Diaries is interesting, don't get me wrong, but I still think Gintama (and several of its seasons) deserve their place in 9.0 and such.

But MAL ratings don't really matter. You like what you like. When using MAL, only avoid anime that people think are bad. Otherwise, if the rating is high enough and the genre suits your taste, you'll know it'll be good enough for you.

Edit: I'm gonna be bold and say this: FMA isn't even that good.
These aren't perfect anime, honestly, there when it comes to Mao Mao, it seems her knowledge is fucking endless, an expert in all fields and says "yeah, I know some shit about explosions and obscure seaweed because it happened back in the verdigis house"

She's only been wrong twice with her "conjecture", neither of which have been consequential, nor does she go about trying to prove or disprove her own hypothesis. It low-key feels like I'm watching one punch man at times.

The characters, motivations and setting are very intriguing and I definitely want to keep watching because I care about these characters alot more than frieren characters but frieren does arcs and small stories a lot better than apothecary diaries.
It's not a competition lil bro
Is winning on a list made by foreign anime fans that can be easily manipulated by vote bombing really a victory? I don't really give a toss what is popular on MAL, I'm just glad there is more than one show I can enjoy in a season lol.   


I think Frieren and this show both have their positives and negatives, I can also see how Frieren easily has a much wider audience appeal than Apothecary Diaries does. While it does avoid being too overly shojo to the point of alienating anybody who isn't a complete fujoshi, it does fall into some tropes of the type of shows aimed at females often fall into. Frieren kinda avoids putting itself firmly into any boxes of tropes much better.   


The biggest crimes being male characters are often presented as meat bags lacking a personality, Jinshi being the biggest crime who is super hot and effeminate to be less threatening but then his only personality trait is liking Maomao. Drinking a potion to make him seem like a eunuch and thus more effeminate on the orders of the emperor is fujoshi bait if I ever saw it lol. I honestly struggle to think of anything Jinshi does in the show that doesn't revolve around Maomao.   


Maomao herself is a bit of a Mary Sue at times. Liked by everybody that isn't portrayed as a baddie or needed to be an obstacle for plot reasons, smarter than everybody, including people much more qualified and educated in fields of study, regularly tells said people they are wrong and has the answer to everything, whole palace revolves around her and what she does, nobody has anything going on without her and need her to define their personality and character. Frieren's characters function without her input and have their own plot threads, the  "weird little tournament arc" introduced a whole cast of new characters with their own backstories, desires, strengths and weaknesses that will be important going forward.   


This show does a lot of things right but doesn't mean it's perfect. You can do a deep dive into both to pick out faults and compare but sometimes it's better to just enjoy what you watch regardless.
Good. TAD is without question probably one of the best anime of the season. 


In my humble opinion Freiren is massively overrated. The series is dull and unnecessarily protracted. If it weren't for the good music and stellar animation people, nobody would care.


Frankly I would have rather seen that quality go into a show like Weakest Tamer. 
Wow. Didn't think this would be an opinion that'd get downvoted here....
Frieren > boku > apo
I like them both.  I'm happy as a fan that I've got a solid block of 90 minutes between these two and Dungeon Meshi for this season.  I'm used to no more than 1-2 shows a season being up my alley.  But to have *three* *at once?!*
>Edit: I'm gonna be bold and say this: FMA isn't even that good.

Hoooo dem's fighting words....  


  
Lemme get my gloves - you may need some help.
I like FMA but it’s a verrryyy different show from the apothecary diaries. They’re both good in their own ways and have their own strengths/weaknesses. I will say I like the apothecary diaries a little bit more though 😅
>t seems her knowledge is fucking endless, an expert in all fields 

But thats not the case - she quite clearly rebuffs Jinshi several times saying this isn't an area of her knowledge, and echoes the same sentiments to the audience through her internal monologue. Knowing "some shit" about the complications of acquiring imported ingredients and chemical reaction makes total sense for her as a keen apprentice chemiwho's clearly allowed to indulge her curisiosty while  mentored by another very senior chemist. 

And moreover, she it specificaly consulted, frequently, on topics that people know she hes either experience in,  or her naturally inquisitive, rational mind will be well suited towards solving. Again - they clearly show her undertaking methodical research when she realises she needs to.   


She's smart, conscientious and practical. I don's think thats implausible at all - I think it's  frankly great us girls finally get a relatable protagonist who does wee with such skills without also needing to be the Kung Fu Princess of Destiny.  


>  
but frieren does arcs and small stories a lot better than apothecary diaries.  


I do actually agree on this to an extent. Most of the characters in TAD are fairly 'static' in personality so far....buuut that because we're still getting to know them. Frieren just by grant of the story alone has more capacity to show people grow - it has more time at it's disposal.  


It doesn't *always* use that well though
I kind of agree that Maomao always manages to succeed with her dice roll conjectures, but I think it's better this way so that any possible MAJOR fuck-ups in the future would actually be impactful. If Maomao was actually procedural all the time with her investigations, it'd be even more boring because she'd be 100% without fault if she ever makes the incorrect conclusion, since the only way that she'd make a mistake would be if she had no way to get a certain piece of evidence that would've changed things.
She failed the court lady exam - she would be the first to admit if she wasn't interested, she didn't remember it.

So if something involves history or geography she's in trouble.
Lmao you know pretty much nothing about MaoMao if you’re going to sit there and call her a “Mary Sue”. If you actually read the written version you’d know that she absolutely is not a Mary Sue with the number of haters she has and her wild personality. A Mary Sue is a boring female character with practically no flaws and MaoMao certainly has her fair share of flaws which is what makes her so wonderfully realistic and interesting af.
>Maomao herself is a bit of a Mary Sue at times.

Dont agree with this, I think they do a good job of showing her limits on several occasions and all the situations presented to her are related to her (quite plausible) enthusiasm for chemistry, scientific method and just being bright, and clearly well trained by an equally scientific mind.   


In particular this also says a LOT (silently) about how her upbringing has shaped her.  


>whole palace revolves around her and what she does, nobody has anything going on without her and need her to define their personality and character.  


This I sortof agree with.  It's more that whole story revolves around her and doesnt take time to show anything else going on. I guess thats the compromise theyve made here - lack of B-story about wider palace workings, so they can keep the main one moving. Considering the different threads theyre trying to tie together, it makes sense to just keep the audience centered on the events she gets drawn into though. To be fair they do *sortof* touch on events outside her sphere through Jinshi, Gyokuyou and Lakan...but at the end of the day, it is 'The *Apothecary* Diaries', so it's not unreasonable to be focused mainly on said apothcary.  


>the "weird little tournament arc" introduced a whole cast of new characters with their own backstories, desires, strengths and weaknesses that will be important going forward.

As I've said elsewhere though - **just because it's important later, doesn't automatically mean it's justified to mass-dump a bunch of story elements in a big clumsy bundle.** TAD does a great job of introducing characters organically that are needed later, *as does Frieren*  at first. The Exam arc though just throws like literally a dozen tropes at you for a reason that makes no sense, and then uses them as an excuse for some flashy fighting with none of the methodical growth that made the story engaging from the outset.  


 The fact remains that  within this arc, you can delete any of the new characters - even all of them - and it'd have basically no effect on the story thus far,  as far as it being Frieren and Fern moving everything forward.
Maomao isn't loved by everyone... She has had enemies, mainly the concubines' ladies in waiting, and the new concubine. The entire first arc of the anime consisted of showing us how she went from being a nobody in the palace to being a well-respected person, and there is a why. They have shown this development in a very slow and detailed way. She is currently sought out to solve problems even if the situations are not part of her expertise, because people know that she has a way of reasoning outside the box. Just because a person is more analytical than average does not make them a mary-sue.

Maomao has also had wrong guesses, she has not arrived in time to solve some problems, and she has even miscalculated how to proceed in her plans (she was recently hit with a club for it). And furthermore, they have shown us exactly how she has managed to survive in the palace (and in the red light district) always having one foot on the tightrope, and we can see that if she makes one wrong step her entire reputation could collapse.
The Freiren fans are pissed 😂 I actually agree with you. I thought it was kind of boring.
I concur.
>In my humble opinion Freiren is massively overrated. The series is dull and unnecessarily protracted. If it weren't for the good music and stellar animation people, nobody would care

Yeah. I think it's also just people craving Comfy Vibes after  Shonen Fatigue to an extent. But yeah  it is ...really obtuse at times and good lord the relentless fucking flashbacks just to spell out literally every Moral of the Story every episode. 

My wife and I started playing a drinking game  - a shot for every time Himmel gets mentioned. We stopped playing after two episodes; it was getting actually a bit dangerous.

You are probably getting downvoted because most people that watch Apothecary Diaries also love Frieren.

While the content of your text actually indicates that you consider Frieren to be a good show, the title does not.
frierens "tournament arc" is something that actually matters for the current issues in the anime, and is one of the best arcs in the series.
Just want to say that I’m sorry you’re getting downvoted and that I actually do agree with you. While I think Freiren’s a brilliant show, I do think it’s overrated. I’d like it better if the main couple in it was Freiren and Himmel rather than Stark and Fern. Stark and Fern are unbelievably generic in my honest opinion (there are already a million other anime couples that have a relationship similar to theirs) yet seem to get most of the attention on that show. TAD on the other hand is just so different. Both the leads have these super wild personalities and a complex relationship that only they can handle. Their relationship is also realistic af and develops over a normal timeframe instead of the classic rushed timeline that most anime’s seem to adapt. TAD further has such an addicting quality that I can’t go a day without thinking about it, while Freiran doesn’t do that for me. People are allowed to like both but I totally don’t blame you for calling it out for being overrated.
I am back to watching anime with these 3 shows, all three are great stories but Frieren and specially Dungeon Meshi are just masterpieces.
I don't think there's any FMA stan here in this sub. ')
It’s not that FMA is bad. It’s just not that good, at least not good enough to be the best-rated anime on MAL for like a decade (which happened solely because of how stubborn the fandom is). Last year we had Kaguya-sama: Ultra Romantic that bested FMA until later.
It's one of my smaller annoyances, what do you think of my other comment tho? That fengming case still feels unsatisfying
> any possible MAJOR fuck-ups in the future would actually be impactful. 

this happened quite recently and she copped a literal club to the face for it.
But the thing is, she is trying to be procedural. She deliberately tips off mysteries as to maintain a degree of plausible deniabilty which is inline with her character, yet when it comes to other cases, she puts her life on the line for something with no beneficial outcome whatsoever. 

Thay fengming case had so many asspulls I was sweating balls. She assumes the same poisonous plants was planted 20 years ago as now, because her father who previously worked there planted similar ones around her house. She then assumes that lishu's poisioning , the maid's suicide, the coloured fire and Ahdou's removal is one big conspiracy instead of 4 seperate schemes, (Ofc she is right). Then remembers that honey can be imbued with poison thanks to jinshi. Puts it all together and accuses fengming because she wears bandages which she assumed were hiding burns.

Tbh, there is no way to solve all mysteries, most are just lost to time and that's what make them interesting.

She did all this for no benefit too😭.
I think you just dislike the exam arc, which is in no way close to a tournament. But calling it mass dump and clumsy is plain wrong man, it's fine to admit to not like something without having to put it down. The exam arc is done really well and it works as a way to make the world much bigger, this will always be at the cost of sidelining some stuff but it is why they gave it time to flesh out parts of it.
 You can literally say the same about each of the plot points we just got covered in Apothecary but it was only when everything was resolved that you could see the connection. 
I just plain disagree with your critique I guess.
[removed]
Like, I remember a few episodes back when we saw the copy of Feiren becoming obstacle for one group of mages. I thought "oh shit this is really cool I wonder how these guys are going to overcome this maids that has been established as incredibly OP?"

 ...and then it just turns out they wait for her to come and take care of it using a weakness that has never been mentioned before. :/ 

They set up this really interesting conflict and then resolve it in honestly the laziest, least creative fucking way they could have.

Feiren in a nutshell.
I mean, I do understand the sort of appeal to a Tolkien-esque story like Feiren.


There's an ephemeral, fairy tale quality to it. None of it really feels real so it kind of feels more magical, but also somehow easier to digest mentally.


But I also find it kind of unsatisfying. Like having a bowl of cereal for dinner.


When I really think about it and compare it to an anime like *Delicious in Dungeon,* the difference is obvious. One is this absolutely massive world you see a tiny sliver of, and really get an understanding of the depth. The other is this really shallow simplistic world that you see a whole lot of, but it never feels truly that big or complicated.


All the characters in Delicious in Dungeon are nuance and have complex motivations. In Feiren everyone is basically a saint or a sociopath. Then there's the way it racializes evil which is so incredibly problematic.

For me it was the unnecessary frieren slander in the middle of the post, no need to bring other anime down to praise your favorite one.
Ah yes - I forgot the average reddit user can't read more than a post title without getting bored and feeling the need to validate their ego in some way.
and yet is being roundly criticised by viewers and critics alike.  


Just because it's important to the story, doesn't mean it's been well executed in this particular adaptation
>. I’d like it better if the main couple in it was Freiren and Himmel rather than Stark and Fern.

I'd like it if they'd just stop transparantly baiting both of them, frankly!
I am an FMA Stan but I personally think The Apothecary Diaries is better than FMA. However this might be due to the fact that my reasons for loving FMA are slightly different than the rest of the FMA fandom
What’s tough about that is FMA is a classic that people grew up with. It’s tough to beat nostalgia no matter the genre
Yeah just replied to it :)
I genuinely don't see how theyre 'asspulls'. All the relevant story elements are bought to her attention for entirely plausible reasons, given her station in the environment. And if the audience is paying attenton,  the links are all well outlined and reasonable to deduce,  as you follow the information MaoMao discovers.  


MaoMao quite reasonably puts them together because they're a series of pretty unusual events that all happen in short order, and she's....well, smart. She goes back through records. She goes out of her way to talk to people and put bits together.  And yeah, she has talent and knowledge in the subject matter (he reason for getting involved in the first placer).   


The audience is walked through this, and even given a pre-emptive explanation  for Fengming's being a possible suspect. Which absolutely makes sense - the concubines are in near constant rivalry, as we see many times.  By the time Lishu tells MaoMao about her honey allergy as a child, both me and my wife were jumping up and down going 'I see where this is going!'.   


There are certainly some elements *not* explicitly explained - like the maids sucide - but thats for very good reason. It   illustrates that even MaoMao *didn't* just get **all** the answers handed to her, but nonetheless figured it out. It also gives something for the audience to figure out themselves, like MaoMao - because not everything gets laid out in a nice clear monologue in real life. Youre supposed to be left asking yourself "Was that maid pushed into the moat? Or did she go over herself, to protect AhDuo and Fengming? Did MaoMao actually get a good person executed for an awful but innocent mistake, or was she actually malicious"  


>She did all this for no benefit too😭.  


And this is exactly what I mean when I say not every answer is spelled out for us. Because there IS a very good reason she keeps getting involved in this stuff. It's just never stated, but left implied, and it's a defining part of MaoMao's character.
The latest episode where Frieren says proudly, "I was the mage of the party that cleared the most dungeons in history" really struck me.

She's genuinely having fun trying to take down the dungeon. 

I don't think she's ever really been proud of her accomplishments before, either.  Defeated the demon king, yada yada.... but that was Himmel the Hero's goal, not hers.  She never really stopped to consider what mark on history that she was making.  Now she's seeing statues of her party everywhere, and now that she's reflecting on exactly *what they did*.... she's genuinely beginning to acknowledge how important it was, and how good they were as a team.

With the exception of a couple cool moments, it’s not that interesting of a show. I stuck around because people said there was a romance between Fern and Stark but they have almost no cute moments together. I get that it’s not the main focus but when the other subplots aren’t that interesting what else is there to look forward to?
>I mean, I do understand the sort of appeal to a Tolkien-esque story like Feiren.

Yeah, thats a good way of putting it. Although Frieren seems to  have more of a focus on specific character development than worldbuilding.  
But I also find it kind of unsatisfying. Like having a bowl of cereal for dinner.  
Also agreed. They dont really do so much with the characters - Himmel flashbacking todays lesson at you is about as deep as it gets.  The rest is pretty superficial too so like you say, youre left with something easy to digest but thats because there's not much there. I think it's part of a wider trend away from 'challenging' media that seems too risky to production executives.  


>Then there's the way it racializes evil which is so incredibly problematic.

 Im surprised nobodys talking about this actually - the whole unconditional, unquestioning "All Demons Are Evil, All Evil Is Demons" premise. This is pretty common in anime as a whole, though (Goblin Slayer, anyone?) See above point about shying away from challenging media.   


We are slowly starting to see a shift away....I mean, TAD is kindof unique in that we're almost a full season in and they haven't *really* had to rely on some arbitrary Bad Guys to drive the plot. Lakan is about as close as you get but even he's just more of an embodiment of generally conniving court politics, rather than some Agent Of Darkness or some shit.
I didn't even slander it, you clown - I pointed out known legitimate, publicised public response. Your defensiveness reveals your insecurity.
Where do you see criticism? I've seen nothing but praise for the anime and especially this arc
The only even slightly valid criticism of this arc is that it'd be better as a movie, but that's not really an issue with the execution, it's an issue with the requirements forced on shows by TV scheduling. The actual execution has been brilliant. The final episode of the first test was spectacular. Every episode of the second test has been incredible, and has given us some of the best battles I've ever seen animated, stuff that makes JJK look janky in comparison. All the while we've been introduced to a large cast of new characters and have been given enough reason to care about all of them, which is no mean feat.

Look, I love The Apothecary Diaries, it's a great show, one of the best of the past few years. But there's a reason Frieren is so highly regarded by so many people, and has cemented itself as one of the all time greats.
You say that but the show moved from 9.14 to 9.15 just recently, moving up at those high ratings is extremely hard. 

Everything is always going to have critics no matter what, everyone got different opinions and nothing is perfect.
It’s just the fandom likes to write bad reviews on whatever that beats them ‘) Nostalgia is one thing but I don’t think it justifies dirty play. Fan ratings aren’t going to be objective in the first place but that’s a different matter.
[removed]
For me it's just something to watch when I'm on the treadmill. I honestly at any point could put down the series and not give a single fuck.
Exactly. Lakan is a great example of how much better this series is.

Like, when you meet him, you pretty quickly come to hate the guy. He implies he raped Maomao's mom for God's sake. Which, not true, but you can understand why he says it like that because he absolutely feels great guilt and sorrow over everything that came after. He really does feel like a scumbag over it.

It's a great example of the kind of fantastic character nuance you don't at all remotely see in Feiren. For supposedly character driven so there's not much *character* to these characters.
Your opening line literally slanders Frieren by calling her a hussy. 

I love both series and female mcs very much, so I take offense at calling Frieren a hussy.
Damn talk about getting defensive and insecure.

Thats 30 seconds of searching out of my browsing history this week and that's all I'm going to do. Theres a stack of youtube episode reviews echoing the sentiment but I can't be bothered digging them all out, the point is proven - ta body of criticism exists, moreso than any other part of the show so far. There's plenty out there - if you're not seeing it, its because you're filtering what you choose to read.
>The only even slightly valid criticism of this arc is that it'd be better as a movie, but that's not really an issue with the execution, it's an issue with the requirements forced on shows by TV scheduling. The actual execution has been brilliant.

Reading this now - I  agree, actually. As a dedicated OVA or something it'd make total sense.

But right now it feels like someone smashed an episode of Dragon Ball Z into Lord of the Rings.  And yes, everyone keeps saying "Oh bUt iT'S iMpOrTaNt LaTeR!!1" but that doesn't mean shit if the viewer doesnt know *why.* Thats objectively bad writing.

I don't give a fuck about Dankman or whatever, no matter how many memes people make - especially when everything up to this point has been aimed at encouraging the viewer to invest in the relationships and growth between the central protagonists . And I still have no idea why apparently a mage so noteworthy they built literal statues of her, now apparently  has to convince people shes  competent by  ticking bureaucratic boxes to find out who's the strongest Super Saiy- I mean,  First Class mage. We've already seen her reputation get her around red tape before, and she literally killed the greatest threat known to mankind - why the fuck would she need to pass a test to go back there?

It's just so obviously contrived, and theyre clearly dragging out every stage of the test that they can, to milk the suspense for a few seconds of action each episode until they get the end of the season. Sure, it's well animated but it's ultimately hollow.  It's like...8 fuckin episodes now and they story has gone literally nowhere of any meaning. It's still just "When are Frieren and Fern clearly going to finish this sidequest?".  


The fact is  I can say with confidence I have skipped the last 5 episodes and missed literally nothing of wider consequence to the story if I hopped in now. Aand  I daresay I could probably do the same at the finale. Everything that's happened in this arc has been only relevant within the arc (even frierens weakness-that-obviously-isn't-going-to-be-a-real-weakness), and largely superficial at that. Glamorous, sure. But of no consequence.

It comes out every Saturday so when I’m extremely bored maybe I’ll turn it on. But when things like the apothecary diaries or sign of affection air the same day it’s like what’s the point?
> For supposedly character driven so there's not much character to these characters.

Yeah but but but....will Fern and Narut- I mean Stark get together????? Plz look at my fan art uwu
So a Reddit thread where everyone disagrees with op, a mal thread where most people disagree with the poster and a fucking screenrant arcticle? These doesn’t set the message you think they do.
Big spoilers Frieren

>!Several characters introduced in the exam is relevant in later arcs, Serie/Methode/Denken/Genau/Sense etc. It contains a ton of world building, it builds up both Fern and Frieren. It shows a lot of new magic. And yes Frieren's weakness will be relevant again!<

Frieren is a Tolkien-esque world, but it isn't LOTR, there is no great good vs evil show down. Frieren's journey with Himmel/Heiter/Eisen to kill the Demon King was more akin to LOTR together with the whole war against the demons. This is a leisure trip for self discovery, they have a set goal but no time pressure other than Fern's impatience.

Exactly like there's a reason why Maomao and Jinshi can't get together. She has legitimate trust issues, combined with the fact that he's her boss, combined with the fact that she has very reasonable fears for her life. She does find him very attractive, but also doesn't want to admit that stuff to herself. She has a deep distrust over basically everyone except her father. And that's just her side of the relationship. That's not even getting in the all his shit.

Meanwhile why don't Fern and Stark get together? "Well they're just so hopeless! Comic misunderstanding!" Something which is just really funny because if you actually watched teenage relationships that's not how that shit works at all. Young people plow through relationships at fucking light speed. It's also just so cliche and overdone.
>So a Reddit thread where everyone disagrees with op, a mal thread where most people disagree with the poster and a fucking screenrant arcticle?

Your first two points are literally incorrect and clearly show you didn't even read those fully, and your last point makes it clear you went into this prejudiced from the start - which is probably why you've avoided my main point that even a cursory search shows these are not the only places with criticism. So really, you aren't  setting the message you think you are.
>Several characters introduced in the exam is relevant in later arcs, Serie/Methode/Denken/Genau/Sense etc. It contains a ton of world building, it builds up both Fern and Frieren. It shows a lot of new magic. And yes Frieren's weakness will be relevant again

Like I said before - this alone doesn't justify just dumping a stack of new elements wholesale into the picture, with nothing more than some thin pretense like a battle royale.  It's a narrative waste and wildly inconsistent in tone, AND it doesn't give decent time to develop these supposedly important characters outside of what they are so far - an array of token, 2D  tropes.  


If these are important elements, they need to be introduced organically in such a way that makes them feel like a natural progression of the tone, the story and setting. As it happens, any one of them could be pulled out of the story right now and it wouln't even make a lick of difference to the current arc- it *still* just ends up being about Fern and Frieren basically doing everything!  


This is where TAD frankly does much better. All the little 'this important later' elements - the various murders, the leadcrafting, MaoMao's adoptive father and his backstory, Lakan and his role at court - are laid out in plausible threads that stand up on their own, then tied together when the time is right. Not dumped awkwardly in a bundle out of necessity.  


But what's odd is Frieren *also* does this better itself, with other characters. Sein was a great example of this, as was Kraft (who personally I think would have warranted a ep or two of his own, for the months they spent together). And even Stark.   


Yet 3/4 of the way through, all that careful weaving gets dropped and  instead they go "OK   so now here's Voice-of-Reason-Grandpa, Bad Girl, Bad Boy, QueerBait 1 and QueerBait 2, Distant Loner with Trust Issues, Overconfident GirlBoss aaaaannd...yeah some  other guys. Oh and new Mystery Girl! Why? Uhhhhhhhh....you'll find out later! but hey in the meantime watch them all fight for....some reason. Isn't that cooll?! "  


>. This is a leisure trip for self discovery,  


&#x200B;

I agree, and thats exactly my point. The mage exam arc *isn't*  this - it's like someone shoehorned an episode of My Hero Academia into it, just to 'get the job done' as far as widening the cast a bit.

>She has legitimate trust issues,

and they DONT FUCKING SPOONFEED THIS TO YOU.

Like she doesnt beat you over the head with it with some shouty speech about how 'TERRIBLE ALL MEN ARE IN THIS WORLD AND THIS IS WHY I CAN NEVER LOVE JINSHI BUT HES SO HOT OMGGGGG.'

Even her own internal voice is completely relatable to the situations she's in, and the audience gets to put together her motivations from the experiences you see shes having, and has had.  Christ, even my meathead B.I.L. started saying shit like "None of these people are necessarily assholes but....somehow also everyone's life kindof... sucks?? Huh??"

Especially after you see the hints of Lakan's involvement, you get to see essentially the degree of sysmtemic trauma thats shaped MaoMao - this is the price she's had to pay for being as smart as she is. It's survival. Theyre *all* surviving, *even women at the top of the food chain*. Gyokuyou is even a pretty interesting character and shes basically just a plot driver.

To be fair I dont think Frieren \*totally\* fails in this sense -  there is a nice implied subtext with how quiet and withdrawn and emotionless Fern often seems to be (even in the face of danger) and how this ties to her upbringing before and with Frieren.  But yeah, they kinda havent; gone anywhere with it, and a lot of it is spelled out so they can wrap up this episodes lesson, give people something to Squee about, and get to next eps.

I think the mark of a lot of good shows is whether the writers trust the audience to pay enough attention to watch the next episode while remembering the context - implied and outright - of the previous ones. The deeper we get into TAD, the clearer you can see this, and the payoff it brings. Even MaoMao outsmarting herself into getting clubbed in the face was absolutely in character - she really was starting to get comfortable with playing outside her ostensible status.
Lol okay, then just remove the entirety of the thread then.

I keep thinking that what Jinshi paid was her debt. Xiaomao wasn't a courtesan, she was the boticaries adoptive daughter. Who happend to own the madam 3 whole nights and days of Lihakus stay with Parin. Which is a lot ! A night is about a whole years pay wasn't it? 
They said something about more gold than the madam had ever seen in her life?
It's said that the cost Is not only THE cost, but the years they might work, so maomao being young and well, untouched, probably racked quite a cost. Still, I feel Jinshi probb paid an abundant extra to demostrate he was "For Real"™®, but MaoMao didn't get it
Jinshi is dumb dumb when it comes to money lol

Could be that Maomao’s debt is half of what he paid the granny for. But bc he has no concept of money, theres a possibility he overpaid 🤣
It was my impression that Jinshi likely paid far more than her debt required and indeed likely matched or acceded the 20,000 he offered Lihaku. Additionally, rather than having her on an employee contract to repay the debt, he hired her without stipulations or terms, essentially freeing her.

Keep in mind that Jinshi has an endless supply of money, no concept of the market value of things, and a stubborn willingness to do anything to prevent Maomao from being sold. Either way, it had to be a king's ransom for the stern old madam of a high-class brothel to abandon all decorum in front of wealthy nobles. Maomao disregards the entire event, never questioning the peculiarities of the supposed contract, even when observing Luomen's odd reaction to it and later Lakan's strange comment about it.
Three nights with Pairin is still waaaaaay less than Pairin's potential buyout price. 

It's not 100% clear if being Luomen's adopted daughter means she was out from under the ownership of the brothel completely as a kid.

But yeah I think Jinshi massively overpaid for her. He doesn't seem to have the best sense when it comes to personal financial transactions.
Ohhh that's right! That was a huge loan she took out to see her dad 🥲
I'm sure whatever he paid, he felt it was a bargain as long as he got Maomao out of the brothel 😂❤️
I believe her debt resulted from 1) her being raised in the brothel, and 2) her mother's medicine costs. So she would have been racking up that debt to the Verdigris House from an early age.
To be fair, >!royalty often doesn’t “need” money since they have so much of it and may fail to realize what things are worth in real life. As illustrated by Jinshi casually offering 20k silver to Lihaku to buy Pairin in episode 21.!<
To be specific: She took the loan out to arrange a meeting with the courtesan to get a guarantor to let her out of the palace. Because she covered the cost of meeting with the courtesan, a high quality courtesan whom he spent several whole DAYS with,  it makes sense she racked up a massive debt. 
Not to mention, it's quite possible she didn't have to accept the loan payment from Jinshi. We don't know if Mao simply being forced to work to pay off the debt or she was under contract.


If she was under contract, granny may have been able to charge a premium simply because she wanted to. She would have been under no obligation to sell.


And to be clear she definitely wanted to charge a premium. Not just because that's who she is, but also because Maomao being bought out earlier represents a significant possible financial loss in her future. Her mother was a top-tier courtesan, and Granny could have made a lot of money from her before eventually selling her off.


Although given how crafty she is, she may have realized it was not wise to refuse his offer. I don't she knows who he truly is, but she would definitely be able to recognize he is a fucking powerful dude.
3) Remember her first Outing where she "paid" Lihaku with a meet-and-greet with Pairin? Looked to me, like that was also put on her tab.
Yes, I get that now 🥲 that madam has no mercy lol
>!Jinshi bought her debt as a contract, meaning that he pays her Lihaku's favor debt, and in exchange she works a determined time for him (as she was doing for the Madame when he found her). I can't recall if the span of the contract is in the novels, but it must be somewhere around 3 years (= 3 nights). The debt for the first years of Maomao's upbringing is a different issue, she doesn't seem to be bounded by it, just Rakan thinks she is.!<
I mean, she's been providing for Maomao's mother for some time now with no real rationale as to why. She does clearly have some undefined ethical limits.
Is this a spoiler based on nov content?
Indeed.
Okay. I'm gonna block you so I can't see it. No offense intended.

Sorry to hear that :((
I have the subscription and I think it's not crappy 😭?
I watch Apoth on Netflix. But if you don't have an account, well... there are *other* sites....
Well I do think the app is terribly designed, it shouldn't be crashing like that? Have you tried watching with the browser or updating your phone's OS?


It's also possible for you to watch crunchyroll through Amazon Prime Video.
I pay Crunchroll and I never had any trouble watching anything… you can try the free trial and cancel if you’re not satisfied with it
Do you use an ad blocker? uBlock Origin extension on Chrome/Firefox or AdGuard Plus on Safari perfectly blocks ads for me with no interruptions. 
aniwave.to 
Kickassanime.mx
I use kaido.to and it’s the best. It’s doesn’t have any ads either
Check out 9anime.
I'm sorry to hear that. I pay more for no ads and don't have too many issues. My only complaint is that after about 5 or 6 episodes it buffers forever and only plays a few seconds at a time. If I switch devices I'm watching on it fixes it.
I watch on 9animetv.to using firefox with the Ublock extension for an ad blocker on pc and mobile and I've never had an issue,  hope this helps.
I use aniflex
If you have VPN you can go over to netflix japan. That's how I watch it even if I currently have crunchyroll premium...
I tried the subscription before and it just never worked for me. And it's not my Internet or location, I've moved more times than I'd like to admit.
Maybe if you have a VPN or another country/state. I reside in the US and checked my account, they do not have it.
it’s on Netflix?????? This revelation would save the world, heal the universe holy shit
I've never even heard of an ad blocker 🫣 thanks for the tip though. Now I just need to find a site that doesn't crash every 5 minutes 😅😭
Ahh, I see. That sucks :(( I am sorry, I assumed that you haven't tried the subscription. There is this site called aniwatchtv, you can check that out.
Only in Japan netflix
OHH sorry, I just now realized that not every show on Netflix is available in every country damn:/ streaming nowadays sucks. I live in Asia and it's available in my zone. 

Ironically, I checked crunchyroll and guess what, Apoth isn't available for viewing in my region 

**¯\\\_(ಠ\_ಠ)\_/¯**
Damn it- America sucks 🫠
Same in my country but with the power of ✨VPN✨ I have been able to enjoy this show and watch puss in boots last wish and all other good stuff overseas that we don't have!

That’s like asking me to choose to burn my palm or the back of my hand. I can’t do it.
I don't want to though.

I like both and baba loli elf-chan is just as precious as poison-neko chan.

So start whatever wars you want. I'll be the anime equivalent of Switzerland.
I’m thrilled for both of them to be on top.  They can swap occasionally depending on what happened most recently but I’m in no rush to see one love triumph over another.  If we could bump Torture Princess up a bit, I wouldn’t mind though.
I’m just happy these two goated shows are in the top
Best girl - jinshi
I can't see myself having to choose between Apothecary Diaries and Frieren. But those categories are about right.
I'm definitely voting Aoi Yuki for best performance with Maomao. And Maomao too for best MC!!
Why didn't they count for this year's?
No point a Shonen that everyone that doesn't watch anime watches is going to win.
I hope both Japanese VAs of MaoMao and Jinshi win if they have a male/female version of the award because they both were freakin perfection. I don’t feel like their VAs are getting the amount of credit they deserve
Best anime song

I'll be honest I like Ambivalent more than Be a Flower
I would not put too much faith in the CR awards show. The CR awards this year and last year were pretty awful with the same 5 shows sweeping everything. Say what you want about it but r/anime’s awards will  at least give Apothecary the mentions it deserves.

We can always dream that CR’s awards will improve though and I’d love for Apothecary to win stuff next year.
Fact. My bad.
😂 True that.
We really eating good this season
It is going to be hard to choose for sure.
The Crunchyroll Anime awards went by October 2022 and September 2023. So, things like Chainsaw Man and Bocchi the Rock were finally awarded from their October 2022 runs. 

So, for next year's awards will be anime from October 2023 and September 2024.

Things like Apothecary, Frieren, Solo Leveling, A Sign of Affection, etc will get awarded next year at the 2025 awards.
Maoamo dubbed and subbed VA really nail her charisma and cat-like demeanor.

Jinshi voice actors are just silky smooth. It's crazy.
they are both good, tbh.
Oh no, for sure. I don't expect anything good. This is more of just a wish and a hope.
Oh I see so there was nothing alike these two this year. I see pure shonen won.
They’re all a perfect fit for the characters. They’re all extremely talented
they are but if I had to choose for an awards it'd be Ambivalent
We're in the same boat. I am wishing as well.

But seeing Twitter mock Vinland Saga fans after JJK swept everything....

I just don't want to set myself up for getting mad if Apothecary gets robbed next year.

Jinshi when he calls Maomao his little cat: 🥰

Jinshi when Lihaku calls Maomao Jinshi's little cat: 😡
Lihaku is a gem. Love these jealous Jinshj moments.
YOOOOOO this episode😭Lihaku’s love for Pairin😭😭😭I CANNOTTTTT - Jinshi’s « hUh » once Maomao finally spilt it was for her sister lmfao like🤣it killed me so much I rewatched it
I must say that the beginning of the episode (first 2-3 minutes) lacked a bit in animation quality. The rest was good as usual.

Loved the jealous Jinshi scene 😂
Another lower stakes cool-down episode to bridge the excitement of the assassination attempt with the climax of the season/volume, which I presume will reveal the full story of Lakan and Fengming (? Maomao's mom). Of course, the question of buying out a courtesan should play nicely into that as well. I noticed the dip in animation quality at the start, but if that's going to happen somewhere, it's fine that it happens here. That scene and mystery was short and resolved itself rather quickly; I anticipate it may become relevant again at some point in the future. (Maybe in a future season.)

It seems like Jinshi is trying to sus out (and buy off?) potential allies among the military quarter of the outer palace. At least that seems like his ulterior motive here. Eliminating a potential rival for Maomao's affections wasn't all he was doing.

Looks like next week we will be getting some sort of wider court event, with a revue of the courtesans. I hope we will probably also get some more information on the families behind the courtesans and their political status and the wider political situation. "An influential minister" is a little vague, but I doubt Hyuga is going to give us ranks and offices, as much as I'd like to know Loulan's father is lower 2nd rank, Minister of the Right, or something.
Is pairin a pedo??
I genuinely thought the subtitles were broken when that came up on the screen
Why did he get pissed when lihaku called her his little cat
His voice acting is peak as always. I couldn’t get over the << Huh>> either
Yeah, I definitely noticed that they were skimping on animation quality in the first scene, and after the four beautifully done previous episodes, it had to happen somewhere. (This scene and this episode as a whole to lesser degree was the right choice of course.) Maomao could be noticeably off model at points.
🤣🤣🤣🤣no no she’s just super super lustful she’s like a cat in heat - will rub and ask everyone but not everyone will please her for her sake
I was definitely squeeing inside 🤣
It's a minor translation thing, but Jinshi said "my cat" and Lihaku said "the cat"

As he should have 😤
So panicky cute!
Oh thank goodness I wasn’t the only one wondering why he was walking the whole time during this scene 😭😅
Is this true?
I am okay with this.
Bro started wavedashing for a sec
Which LN volume was this in
sooo cute lol 😆
🤣❤️ thank you for clearing his name!
Plot Twist: 

He was running in circles and passed Lakan many times because he was panicking too much to watch where he’s supposed to go
Are there light novels on this what is the source material?
Yes, and no. That's how MaoMao described it.

Yeah, it was a really weird choice by the studio to slow that scene down. In every other version he was running desperately to get her to an infirmary.
Yes there’s a panel in the written version that confirms it, and a fan took the time to animate it

Volume 2
[removed]
I can’t use the actual word because the automod will remove the comment but it’s the maanga (remove the extra “a”) by Nekokurage. I haven’t read the other version of the maanga but I’m pretty sure that one may also have a panel like this since both versions are usually very similar to each other
Actually just “yes” because this is how the mangakas portrayed it though. The lead writer mentioned in an interview that she often allows them to fill in the gaps or add their own little details whenever she has writer’s block

Depends on how much prep time MaoMao has to work with against prep time Batman.
Only if it's explicitly poison. Batman is so cautious he takes measures against Justice League members who are far above him. But Bruce Wayne is just a human (maybe with a few inhuman traits.) So yeah, a poison strong enough will kill him, unless...
Why did you post this? Are we stupid?

The auto mod will not let me or anyone post where it is , but its the letter j for Japanese and it is a club for japanese novels on a website you will have to Google as we cannot provide the link,

Or you could go post in the sub the auto mod links to
Google “the apothecary diaries LN” (use the full form of LN) and click the link that says “j-n0vel.club” (the zero obviously represents an “o”. In my google search it’s the second link). This site provides the fastest updates for the LN
If you're in America, look into the libby app, and you can get a library card and read all available volumes in english for free. It will at least still support the author because the librarys buy the digital volumes.
Vol 1 will soon be available in physicals. Vol 1-10 in digital form by amazon or the website everyone else us pointing you too.
Book Walker is the official Kadokawa website/app where you can buy the volumes.
If anyone wants a link to the LN's DM me I gotchu

Not only getting syphilis... but more like... getting her life ruined and now being a shadow of her former self? Also Maomao doesn't have the best relationship with that woman. So a bit of basic disrespect swings with these words.

I hope that explains without going into spoiler territory.
Difficult  not to spoil but let's just say that MaoMao is sad and furious to see the lady clinging to a memory she should probably have discarded long ago for her own good.
I saw a theory that she is maomao’s mother ( she has the same hair and eye color as her mom ) she started playing with the stones ( probably the same game that she used to play with lakan ) after she found out that lakan is there so maybe maomao called her stupid for missing him
This will be explored in a different episode, probably the last one or second to last one :D
If you do want spoilers, ask in the other subreddit. They're (rightly) discouraged here.
It gets revealed, its supposed to be confusing right now
Because she heard about the "monocle guy" and took the Go stones, like he is her only motivation >!(and she only makes bad choices).!<
I think that scene is all about timing. What happend right before she reached for the GO stones. And well, Maomao dosent see her as a mother and ir looks like she truly got herself in quite a mess. 
I think its her mother maybe?
Mmmm- this helps a lot! Ty!
The real bad choice she made was not speaking out. Her game wasn't so good in the real world maybe.

JP dub has Aoi Yuuki giving an all-time great performance, which should decide it for you based on that alone.
The Japanese VAs of Jinshi and MaoMao are just pure perfection for me (a huge reason I fell in love with Jinshi was his voice - slick af but also serious af when needed) - they both change their tones with each scene so seamlessly, so I would recommend sticking with the sub. The other languages put in a good effort but no one captures their true characters the way MaoMao’s and Jinshi’s original (Japanese) VAs do
After watching the sub, I can't stand Jinshi's dubbed voice. It lacks his smooth supercilious manner. The Verdigris Madam has much more character in the sub. Maomao is ok.
>then it would be better to watch in orginal dub as they convey emotions better

"dub" only refers to when it's a different language than the original btw. Personally, I always watch subbed, so that's what I'd recommend.
As someone who has watched both sub and dub, both are good. 

The story is about a 17-year-old apothecary named Maomao, who is good with poison and medicine, who has been kidnapped and forced to work at the emperor's palace. Once she is found out to be intelligent, she soon catches the eye of Jinshi, an influential eunuch who recognizes her talents and promotes her. Maomao now solves various medical mysteries around the palace. 

When it comes to action or screaming, there is a good amount when Maomao starts piecing together clues and solving the mysteries. Maomao's English Dub voice actor really shines. I'd say watch it dubbed if you really want too, but subbed is just as good. It's just preference at the end of the day.
I personally really like the dub, Emi does a really great job voicing Maomao
My advice is watch both.
I like both dub and sub versions! Both have their respective charm, truly is to your preference
Hindi dub is really good, I usually prefer sub but for this show hindi was great. But once you are caught up you will have to watch new eps in sub
The voice acting is very very good, most of all the main character, so I would recommend watching sub (although I always watch sub regardless)
I watch both.
I watch it in both 🤷‍♀️
Both are good, the sub being slightly better than the dub. However, the most recent dub episode had one of Kaiji Tang’s best emotional moments I’ve heard ever. On par with his performance in jjk. Then again I’m a little biased because I love Kaiji Tang 😂
I read the lightnovel first and I think the english dub voices also really captured the spirits of the characters for me
Im kinda the opposite, I only watch in JP but only because I hate MaoMaos voice actor, she sounds good during the serious moments but ither times it lacks something in her character. Whilst with Jinshi I get similar vibes from both languages. But idk if thats because I love the voice actor and he also voices Dazai?
I agree with you both are good.  I think I would suggest watching it in sub first because I personally think watching in the original language is always a good idea... and rewatching it either english or hindi (unsure how good the hindi dub is cause i dont speak the language). I do think this show is worth rewatching so its not really a which one is better: \*Why not ~~both~~all?\*
I honestly disagree. The English VAs do a terrific job but they can’t capture the broad range that the Japanese actors can do. In English, Jinshi sounds serious/gruff even when he’s in his flirty mode with MaoMao, which is certainly not how the light novels depicted him (he’s supposed to be more mischievous during those scenes). And MaoMao doesn’t sound as cute/excited during the medicine scenes as her Japanese VA sounds. Even her most iconic line (“This… is poison” - episode 6) had two different tones in the Japanese version while the English VA delivered it in one tone. The Japanese VAs of the leads have a broader, more convincing range than the English VAs in this show, which is needed because Jinshi and MaoMao are very dynamic characters with broad personality ranges
Omgeebus! I thought I was the only one, I don't usually watch sub but it's too good not to, I recently went back to dub to rewatch anything I might have missed and I found MaoMao's voice to be annoying or not go with her/situation
To be fair, I can't watch any subs, except where no alternative is (was) available. Some Miyazaki movies when first released in the US, for example.

WHO DID THIS
AND NOW ITS BACK TO 5 STARS WTF
It was Suirei.
I don’t care. The anime is awesome. And I don’t want to be part of the next „FMA:B fandom“. Let’s appreciate the greatness of this masterpiece without giving too much thought about some people downvoting this anime.
I bet Lakan did this, he has a history of lowering the value of beautiful things 🤨
WHO DID IT OUT OF SPITE
WHO RUINED OUR 5 STAR RATING??
I'm crying your profile pic is so based😭 😭 😭
Let’s goo. People seem to have voted for it.
We scared the culprit so much that they changed it lmao
And now back to 4.9 :(((
I’m actually surprised people check up on the ratings.

I usually enjoy the show cause the moment numbers/ratings get involved it just turns toxic
WHOEVER IT WAS, I WILL FIND THEM.
Get the guns we're going hunting

Thank you for posting this!! I noticed the same change while watching. Jinshi had pretty much assigned Gaoshun to be MaoMao’s babysitter so that she doesn’t use her leg as her next Guinea pig 🤣 I love her 🥹 and Jinshi 😍
Jinshi constantly making sure his girl doesn’t kill herself 🥰

I honestly can't decide... both parts are awesome in their own right... but if I had to decide... I would go for the first part, just because I liked the atmosphere between Maomao and Gyukuyou (and I don't know if I spelled THAT right xP).

Though the building "tension" between Maomao and Jinshi was great from the start and I give the second part points for it and its more dramatic and serious side to it.
I absolutely love them both to pieces, but nothing will ever trump the scene of MaoMao saving Jinshi for me (at least for this season)
Yes.
None of the above ☝️
I'll always love the jade palace arc.
Lady Goku as I've heard some people call her

i thought the same thing, that’s why i laughed so hard at that scene
LOL I was thinking that if Jinshi had overheard that he would just be like "ME! Please me! Do those things to me!" lol
"Promises, promises..."
For me it was one of those 😳 moments if you get what I’m saying…
What episode is that

Lmao. I find it funny how he's more ripped than he looks, I got surprised by that
He is a muscle head. Love Lihaku!
Lol the next episode is going to be hilarious 😂
His muscles in this preview looks way better than his muscles in the OP, so I'm very glad with that 😂
I can see why Parin likes him.
Oi
The anime cloth armor
he did a machio-san :o
A fine specimen for Pairin indeed.
He really does have big dog energy. He's a total golden retriever, lol

I was proven right, the datura (thornapple, the flower that bounces around for 10s in the 2nd OP) gets important. This show is amazing
Her cackling like a madwoman, then remembering who was around her and just going all serious had me in stitches
One thing I will say though, is that, Lihaku's muscles on the next episode's preview is way better and more well-proportionate than his muscles in the 2nd OP, so I'm glad for that 😆
Loving all the callbacks and payoffs.

&#x200B;

Did Natsu Hyūga keep a connection map on her wall (a la Pepe Silva) when she wrote this?  


Edit:  whoops, wrong name
This episode was awesome!
Does this episode start volume 3? Want to start reading when the anime ended on a new volume.
There really was a lack of followup for the previous episodes events.   


Maomao takes a near lethal blow from a mace, has an altar crush her leg, and then Jinshi bleeds her out slow walking back to his place? And the first thing they do is call in some people to ask questions? No empathy? Sure theres some later in the episode after maomao ex machina heals herself back to near full besides a limp and a small face bandage?  


Just feels like they threw away or rushed the most impactful scene in the entire season.
So does Jinshi think he's the emperors' brother? It seems like he thinks there's a slim  possibility he's the son right?
This episode left me a little bit disappointed.

Don't get me wrong. Its still excellent, and seeing getting the big reveal was fantastic but...

I feel like Maomao and Jinshi's relationship should have progressed more than it did. She literally saved him from an assassination attempt last episode, and suffered \*massive\* (and risked death) injuries to do so.

Anyway, I also think Maomao's still suffering from her head injury. I think that villain laugh at the end there would have been internal if she wasn't recovering from a concussion.
- Maomao - Holmes
- Jinshi - Mycroft
- Goashun - Lagarde 
- Suirei - Moriarty

(Not a perfect analogy though)
Interesting development. So both our main characters are basically aristocracy. I wonder if Maomao's father is aware about who Jinshi really is and plans to get them married. This would secure him a lot of power, I bet.
>!Voted "Excellent" because it was. Although, the pace was way too fast for the part of the audience without previous context on Jinshi's secret, and also a bit about Suirei's resurrection method. Maybe the showrunners can consider narrative time instead of the fixed measurement of "two written chapters = an anime chapter".!<
What time is the episode usually available on Crunchyroll?
My theory is that Basen likes Maomao and that's why he was angry yelling at her.
Can someone clear what is up with Jinshi?? Is he the emperor's son or brother like Im so confused (\*o\*)
Is the red hair girl concubine Loulan?
In the written version there was way more blood gushing from her leg 💀💀💀
I believe this season of the anime will cover the first 2 volumes only. The third volume will only be animated if the studio confirms a season 2
Exactly, I was like what the hell when I was watching it
Yes, he thinks he is the Emperor's brother... or maybe not...
It seems so. I thought the 2 children had the same father, but Ah Duo birthed the prince’s child, not the emperor. That would make Jinshi his son and not his brother. 
It does seem like Jinshi thinks he’s his brother. (I thought he was too until today.)
He knows he's the current emperor's son. Remember how he acted when Ah Duo had to leave the palace?
Yes! I can see this!
So like folklore Cinderella tales Cinderella is some form of Noble or Royal. Disney even had Stepmother addressed as Lady at the Ball. The Prince can't marry a commoner after all. (actually some did but at political risk, but it not common)
I thought it would be out by now. Hmmmm....
I normally go with 6pm GMT + 1 hour... so about 7-8pm GMT it should be out by...

Maybe to reduce load it's spread out in ways so people watching aren't crowding in.
Idk, he seemed fairly annoyed by her the previous two times they worked together 
Son
Iirc she also moved about way more too
Yeah and I liked how they made her almost Chibi-like

Unfortunately for story purposes jinshi must slow walk with intact drip smh
Took me out of the scene completely.

There's "dramatic scenes" and there's "scenes for drama". This is the latter.
This was 100% for dramatic effect. In the written version he straight up rushes her to an infirmary and there is no gushing blood trail while he does so (although her wound is still a deep gash in the written version as well). We also later see him >!perform cpr on MaoMao!< in a much later chapter arc for a different situation so it’s safe to assume that he does have some medical training and probably did some basic work on her before carrying her given that the blood loss wasn’t depicted in the written version.

On an unrelated note I’m kind of in love with this scene now. When I first watched it I had the same reaction but I’ve rewatched it a ton of times since it aired because I’m too obsessed with this show and I freakin love this scene now. The art, animation, and music were all very beautiful in my opinion and gave off CDrama vibes
We have no reason to assume (at least off the anime) that soldiers in this time period got any sort of first aid training. Likewise he might have a skilled apothecary in his staff but she is very dedicated to her pursuit of poisons and how they relate to medicine and treatment. It is at best a coin flip to see if she taught jinshi anything related to first aid and even then that might be a generous assumption
For some reason they made it seem like Maomao died, Jinshi carrying her slowly while sad music played
The anime episode needs to be 24 minutes long. They clearly tried to lengthen the lakan scene before that as much as possible too.😂
Can’t say that I felt annoyed, but yes, agree with your thought processes there! Lol
That's what I pointed out last week but instead got replies that she was not critically injured or bust an artery
Maybe it's not that much that would bleed her out. I guess the wound at her head was more dangerous
[removed]
[removed]
Right, and he was walking SO SLOWLY. Stop the bleeding and get a stretcher and some help!! 🤣
Yeah I get that this is a romantic drama but the show has always been big on science and investigation... Guess they wanted to lean on the drama in the end of the ep, which I totally get, but for something as severe as Maomao getting seriously injured, for someone as smart as Jinshi to not get her first aid... 🙃
Vindicated! 🤣 I do enjoy the drama but his lack of urgency really took me out of the scene. That's just me though 😂
To be fair there are some historically inaccuracies such as CPR being shown in episode 8 while it hasn't been discovered until 1891 for chest compressions and 1960 for the modern CPR form that's seen in episode 8. So wouldn't surprise me if they do have some basic first aide knowledge.
And then the latest episode just jumps right over it for the most part.

He didn't know the dynamic between Jinshi and Maomao, it's highly likely that he thought he brought Maomao to be his slave/maid, Lakan could have snatched Maomao from anyone but not from Jinshi. He was shocked that Maomao cared enough to risk her life to save him, and that Jinshi cared enough to carry her a low born girl/maid infront of others
He's an intentionally mysterious character you learn more about as things go on.

You don't need to understand why he's shocked. You just need to take a note that he shocked and what that could possibly mean.

Although to be clear, we know he knows Maomao is his daughter. If she is correct that means Jinshi is also the actual Crown Prince, something that Jinshi knows. Seeing the Crown Prince carrying his unconscious daughter would be shocking for anyone.

Although the fact that this happened after an assassination attempt that I don't know if he knew about, but I'm betting that he did, I can see him being shocked.

As it stands he's one of my favorite characters and I think his story is just so beautifully tragic and bittersweet. I really hope one day he and his daughter are able to become amenable.
Tbf, the current progress in anime didnt confirm anything *yet*. They painted him mysterious, dropped different small important details from the past and present. But since nothing's confirmed yet, everything we think of are just assumptions for now. Of course, a few more episodes, we'll know more
You are relying too much on your head-canon if you think that's the case.
He probably didn't expect his daughter to die, which is what it looked like from his perspective.
Imo he was shocked. Imperial Brother, brother of the Emperor cares about his daughter.
Just watch 2 more episodes to know more about Lakan instead of theorising stuff, saying because you will feel dumb later tbh.
Can't tell. I don't remember that part in the source material '( so what we can give is speculations (?).
She didn't know it was Jinshi who was in the ceremony.
He is also my favorite character. Maybe one day we will get a whole volume of the La clan. 
I believe this is the correct take on why he was so surprised.

He's a strategist, and in all his planning for this event, the one thing he didn't anticipate was Maomao getting seriously injured.

(The noble performing got splatted? Not Lakan's problem.  If it's actually Jinshi, even better, although I'm not 100% sold on Lakan being aware that Jinshi was *that* high up.  Maomao actually saves him and gets credit for uncovering the plot?  Good, good, she gains status and esteem and earns favor from the emperor.)
He knew. >!All La clan members inside court know. Except Maomao. Or so she says!<

Oooooh! Thanks for that. I would never have noticed.

Does anyone else have trouble with how exactly Maomao suffered only a long cut from a giant falling beam? I can't see it touching her without doing major leg or foot destroying damage. Maybe it was a cable? She must have been insanely lucky.
I think it was the square looking piece near her leg that was holding the beam up.
You're welcome, I'm glad I caught it! It was a nice touch 😂

I assumed some sharp piece caught her leg as she launched herself across to push Jinshi out of the way 😅

Imma guess fern is ahead of her
Personally if I had choice, Maomao would be #1, for this specific category ranking.
Our girl took a metal bat to the head despite being so little with zero fighting ability and still managed to save someone - a freakin queen 😭
Sooooo pretty and so deserved!
It's fine, Maomao doesn't want or need the attention of #1 😂💖
i was fully on board but after around episode 15, they wrote her in kind of boring way :/ i hope the show picks up, with more interesting plot development and character coherence
FUCK YEAH! LETS GO! OUR GURL RULES!
Actually, she's behind her
Yeah, I think Maomao is most deserving of #1 for her just being a great female MC in general. Intellectual, fun personality, and the general intrigue around her character background.
So very true
She'd be scared of being kidnapped again, but hope alternately they'd poison her to get her out of the way.
TF did you SEE the last 2 episodes?!
There was a few slower episodes, but Maomao was fine regardless... a few slower episodes doesn't mean her character was boring itself. lol

The latest episodes prove those episodes were building towards something for the larger plot. You just needed to let it cook. 🤷‍♀️
I also thought similar assuming that some of the investigation episodes were filler to demonstrate Maomao's skills (I was fine with it, but they weren't as exciting as the earlier episodes) until I was shocked to realize that all those episodes were immensely important for the overall plot. Just watch the last 2 episodes.
Wait then who the fuck is ahead of her what
Ordinary stalker magic
Our other poison resistant girl: Yor
Who else is up there?
Then I am alright.
Ahh right
Top 10:

1 - Anna Yamada

2 - Yor Forger

3 - Mao Mao

4 - Fern

5 - Frieren

6 - Rukia Kuchiki

7 - Nobara Kugisaki

8 - Mikasa Ackerman

9 - Kana Arima

10 - Akane Kurokawa
Hold on!!! How is Yuki from *A Sign of Affection*, not even in the top ten for this specific ranking?!
Who's anna yamada?
Make sense
These are for 2023 animes
Main character from “the dangers in my heart”, a currently aiding romcom. It’s been sweeping all polls, and for good reason
Okay, thanks for clarifying.
Really? *She's* leading the polls?

It’s certainly datura, a flower that prominently features in Japanese mystery and detective fiction, such as >!Tsukihime and Ubume no Natsu,!< and is known for its >!amnesiac, psychedelic, anesthetic, and poisonous!< qualities depending on the dosage. Suiren was planting it on the mysterious garden mound two episodes ago, if you will remember.
Surei - tall medical court lady 


Suiren - Jinshi’s lady in waiting
dang it
