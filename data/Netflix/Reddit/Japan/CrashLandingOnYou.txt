Maybe seri's oldest brother is not really capable of holding his own company (I got the impression that he's not that competitive and smart like the other brother and seri). Nevertheless, his wife still sees him as awesome and that's the funniest part lol
Ok. So wtf. >! They killed GSJ!< I was already expecting it to happen cos you can't have two couples in the show who have the same predicament but damn, it still hurts like hell. Although seeing Seo Dan strutting like a boss-ass bitch with her big-ass instrument case is kind of satisfying in its own way. 

We made it guys. I'm just a lurker to this thread for the past couple of weeks but it's been fun. I really enjoyed all the funny comments and it felt that I'm not the only one who's waiting patiently for the weekly episodes. I would not complain that the ending felt formulaic and vague coz the show felt like that from the start. And I love it. Even though it left me with some questions (so after the two-week vacation to switzerland, what now?) but I'll just turn off my brain for this topic lol. See you on the next best thing guys!
That Seo dan's "don't need a man" ending lol. How to be a firm, elegant, independent, and strong like her? Loved her character throughout the drama!
If the two of them are not actually dating in real life at this point it only proves how amazing they are as actors. Honestly the chemistry between them in the show and especially in the bts is UNPARALLELED.
The scene at the DMZ, when YSR is running towards RJH... probably the most powerful scene IMHO. RJH preventing YSR from getting shot, the present tension between the North soldiers and South agents, the words "Peace" from the overhead shot... very well done from a cinematography angle.
I always get some waterworks going whenever I see the sacrificial love displayed by RJH, Seri, NK ducklings and Man Bok in almost every recent episode. 

This episode, it still took me by surprise to see Man Bok jumping in front of RJH without hesitation to take a bullet for him, with his handcuffed hands up in the air while still in his usual body stance of fearfulness and smallness. He was scared but he was courageous and self-sacrificing to the end. 

RJH then took his turn in blocking Man Bok from danger while the rest of the ducklings took a circled group stance which was a collective and protective do-or-die. 

I lost it here, and wondered how many of us have mates who would *catch a grenade for ya*. 

I am mighty glad that Man Bok came full circle, more than redeemed himself and didn’t die. His powerful last scene where he finally had on an expression of peace and joy at his new job, listening to and recording the sounds of nature under the legitimacy and disinfecting power that sunlight brings, really stayed with me. 

The actor who played him did a brilliant job and successfully embodied his character with every inch of his body.
One thing I realized that makes Seri unique is that she's not the typical kdrama female lead who likes the guy but acts like she's not interested, bickers with the guy, doesn't really take any action and just lets him chase her. 

I love that Seri fights for JH every step of the way. She runs to him. She saves him. She takes care of him. I love when a woman is brave and confident in herself, and isn't afraid to make her feelings known or take initiative in the relationship.
I’m very happy with the ending that they gave us as this was most likely the best scenario that could have happened - them seeing each other intermittently.

I was really impressed with the way that this show was done and definitely had strong acting performances from both leads.

“She must be dating a foreigner”

 “Ah then we might need to do an English press release”

LMAO

Loved this drama - A+ for making me cry
For me, it's official that CLOY > DOTS.

Also too bad there's no Season 2 :(
Seri named her product line for the village ajummas as Saudade. And that is exactly how I feel now that the show is over.

"Saudade” is a untranslatable Portuguese term that refers to the melancholic longing or yearning. A recurring theme in Portuguese and Brazilian literature, “saudade” refers to a sense of loneliness and incompleteness."

"The concept has many definitions, including a melancholy nostalgia for something that perhaps has not even happened. It often carries an assurance that this thing you feel nostalgic for will never happen again. My favorite definition of saudade is by Portuguese writer Manuel de Melo: "a pleasure you suffer, an ailment you enjoy."

Not to mention, the entire OST, especially the orchestral version of The Song For My Brother,  bursts with this indescribable melancholy. This show and soundtrack better win awards.
Ahhhh!! Yes Switzerland is beautiful but why are they trolling us with no babies.  Especially having seen SYJ, her on screen father and NIS guy hold one on Instagram. That was NOT the same child as baby Seri in the flashback. I would have liked to see Seri’s and RJH’s parents as grandparents as well visiting Switzerland!  When the camera zooms out to see the stunning scenery but you wanna zoom in and watch them make out ... hahah. Bravo acting on HB, SJY, Dan, and the wonderful elegant beautiful  strong mamas. I miss this beautiful show already. They made me laugh, made me cry like a mofo, really raised my blood pressure, inspired my style, and brightened the weekends. Also that’s one helluva way to meet your in-laws. First Siri gets kidnapped then RJH is held by NIS. Son Ye-Jin brought out a character I personally identified with in the past. One who has felt loneliness, wanted to disappear, and exacerbated by the birthday. In fact several yrs I woke up from one birthday 3 weeks later in the ICU. Hyun Bin’s portrayal of a protective all engulfing grateful love in that hug reflected in my life as well. Inspired me to want to tune the piano and play the song for RJH’s brother. This drama wasn’t just entertainment it had wonderful messages throughout. And the reminder that there are still victims of the political climate, still separated from family and loved ones by the 38th parallel.
Welp. That's that. I'm sad about seung jun dying. It's good that the second brother and wife got what was coming to them. But I'm still sad for him and dan. 

The idea popped into my head that hardly anyone knew of him dying. He also, I dont think, had a proper funeral by anyones standards. I would like to know what kind of a send off he got. It must have not been easy for dan to bury him. 

The thing that bothers me the most honestly is that so few will remember him in that world. I feel some relief knowing that he had some impact and that he is still missed.
Say what you want about the pacing of the ending or the outcome, I'm just happy the writer didn't fuck us like with *Memories of the Alhambra*.
Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin's chemistry are off the charts. I've never gotten that fluttering and at the same time bittersweet feeling they gave me.

Thinking about not watching any kdramas as I deal with the withdrawal. As Seri and RJH said, a 6 month condolence period seems necessary.
Overall, my favorite thing about this drama was the way that love, friendship and humanity transcends borders. There we such beautiful moments in the entire episode especially that really brought that message home, and it was so beautiful. I'm getting emotional as I write this, thinking about it, because there's so much turmoil in our world right now, and I wish we could all just recognize each other as fellow humans, and we all struggle and laugh and love the same, no matter where we are or what our politics. Such a moving drama, and such a tender, warmhearted ending.

And I thank you all for being with me during this! I've really enjoyed all your comments, beautiful people!

And now, let me dry my eyes and (spoilers) give my favorite moments:

\#1 Moment: I laughed-sobbed when I saw Man Bok (I think?), >!in the fields, recording peacefully the sounds of the wheat. SUCH a perfect ending for such a beautiful human.!<

\- Dan's Mom. Her character! Need I say more?

\- >!The text messages. The flower pot. The care he put into his goodbye. !<

\- The way the intro was basically re-done >!during the years they were apart!<. That was so beautiful

\- The NIS agents. I mean, speaking to my opening, this was a moment for me. NK and SK are literally brothers and sisters, and the compassion of the officers was a beautiful thing.

\- RJH's dad>!, saving everyone's lives.!<

\- I liked Dan's ending. I'm so sad that >!SG actually died. I would have loved for him to live. But, Dan is so strong, and she will be okay. I loved seeing her with her cello at the end.!<

My only (very very small) complaint: >!Is that RJH simply could have called her when he got out of NK, no? I mean...he could have memorized her number and called her. But, the ending was beautiful, nonetheless.!<

And to whomever wrote the comment on Ep 15 about the picnic with the twins, >!we got the picnic! No twins, but that's okay. And, by the way, I'm perfectly contented that we didn't see any "passionate" or "shirtless" moments. This drama was about the best kind of love, and we didn't need any of that for our hearts to be full.!<
It has been one heck of a roller-coaster ride.
I'm glad to have experienced the feeling of having something to look forward to on Saturday and Sunday for the last few months.


The journey was meaningful yet painful.


2 things broke my heart.

1. Goo seungjun

2. The reality that some things are beyond our control. The way Seri would love to communicate and bond with the ducklings and ahjummas in NK and vice versa. It was bittersweet.


Few random things that touched my heart:

1. Seri's choice collection with ahjummas faces printed in the boxes. It was so sweet of Se-ri.

2. ManBok stepping up protecting RJH when he was about to be shot.

3. The way Dan has made her way getting revenge to Sehyung and his wife.

4.Dan's mom's lines when she was speaking to RJH's mom ending everything properly and how they made it a point to make each other realize how their children suffered for the last 10yrs because the 2 obeyed them.

5. Dan's smile inside the car when GSJ started singing. It was too painful for me as a viewer. It was her first genuine smile in the series. Perfect scene.

6. Seri with her staff, dining in and sharing laughter. She has found her ducklings...


7. 4 ducklings sitting side by side while talking about what they miss in SK. And that handsome comrade at last learned how to speak more than a word. Lol.

8. The ending in Switzerland. Just what I pictured it will be.


Perfect.

Thank you so much, Crash Landing On You.
"You're not [Heidi](https://imgur.com/FEQL2Ut), so why do you keep going there?"
While I was watching the ending, I felt a bit underwhelmed but realized that it was the most realistic given the circumstances. It was bittersweet for me.
Even if it is (for the time being) only two weeks a year, they're still able to make a home and a life together. 

I won't say it's not bittersweet, or that I'm not crying buckets, but they have the promise of a future together and that's all I wanted for them.

CLOY has both broken and filled my heart.
SJ has been comedy relief for most of the show so I’m really surprised he was the one to die. In death his character actually leaves a bigger impact so I’m not mad. 

I like Dan’s “I don’t need a man” ending. It shows real growth for both her and her mom after the way they waited 10 years for JH. 

The JH and Seri farewell at the demarcation line was intense and perfectly encapsulates the conflict of the show. I loved the shot of the flying birds. Images of flying birds have been used several times throughout CLOY. They mock our heroes bc they can easily cross that border line and they also remind me of the cowherder and weaver girl legend. 

I also loved JH dropping his mask to cry in the car with his dad. And the way his mom stepped on suicide poison upon his safe return. The writer rightfully focused on the humanity of JH’s family (his main reason for leaving Seri to return to NK) instead of wasting time on NK military politics (which were resolved quickly). 

I like how all the support characters got happy endings and it doesn’t have to involve them leaving NK. Seri naming beauty products after the ajummas made me tear up. Manbok’s happy face recording nature sounds was beautiful (he defied everyone’s prediction by not dying). The ducklings all together with Pyo Chi Su becoming captain.

JH’s timed messages to Seri and the edelweiss plant are clever ways to bridge their separation. I like how they both worked towards reuniting in Switzerland - it wasn’t handed to them. 

The Swiss ending is open to interpretation. It can be sad or happy depending on the way you look at it or fill in the gaps. I imagine with their resources, it’s easily possible for them to meet often and start building a life and home together there.
I'm frustrated that they will only have two weeks a year together for the rest of forever. It feels like a life half-lived.

Also noticed they didn't sport those couples rings any longer. I wonder then if that two weeks is without a promise of anything more.

I'm with everyone else who wanted the fairytale forever.

Ok, so many people are pissed and think SJ’s death was a waste. 

I understand emotions are high but I gotta say I don’t think his death was a waste. 

I think his death has a better impact on SD’s character development than if he had lived. 

If he lived, she would be waiting for another man AGAIN, just like she did with JH. 

His cute flirting helped Dan get over JH. 

And his death helped Dan realize she doesn’t need to live her life around a man. She’ll have him in her heart always. 

Their love story counters the Seri/JH love story - showing that not every love story gets to take off or gets a happy ending but such a love story is just as beautiful and impactful. 

SJ was always a support character. The writer used him to develop other characters. He supported Seri and JH’s romance. Then he supported Dan’s character development. Him dying makes perfect sense to the story imo.
I think part of the brilliance of this show was its ability to self-reference so well. The writer did such a great job with making sure that no line was  said without a purpose. 

Some lines or conversations that seemed to be just casual or said in passing actually carried a lot of weight throughout the series. Some lines even carried a theme throughout the drama. One example was SR and RJH’s conversation in episode 6 about coincidence vs fate. I thought it was just a cute jealousy scene for RJH but that theme was mentioned over and over again throughout, which made that initial conversation so much deeper than I thought. 

Another example was SR telling RJH part of her address in the very beginning, which was incredibly significant to the plot line later on.

UGH, so much brilliant writing done in this drama. I’m so proud to have been able to watch CLOY.
What kind of rom-com makes you cry almost all through the episode? Seo Dan is a badass! I loved her arc though she didn't get many scenes at all😔.I love her mom too. That's mom-daughter goals right there! 

One scene that stood out as a relief from all the crying was when Yoon Se Ri's  thirsty SIL wanted to stay by her side while sideyeing RJH and her hubby pulled her away u,pon realizing it.

Overall, happy with the ending. It's as realistic as it possibly could be. Happy for the ducklings and Man Bok. I wish they had extra special episodes but I'll take what I can get.
The first 40mins really was a tearjerker. The next hour was a treat to the heart. The PS I love you modified style tugged my heart, too. 

Still. I'm happy with the ending. There's still a tug in my heart that I can't explain but I'm happy. Happy and sad. Bittersweet I guess. 

Honestly, I was waiting for GSJ to appear suddenly for Seo Dan but I guess that would be too much. She cant have her revenge because I guess the 2nd brother already was in jail. 

Gosh. So many things but all in all, I feel like all questions was answered. The writer did her best. 

Do not speed watch. You will miss things that could answer your questions. Do not over analyze as well as it will eat the fun. Just enjoy it. ❤
I never found Hyun Bin attractive before. Like don't get me wrong, i didn't find him ugly but he was just... average to me??? But this drama made me see him in a new light. Idk how he managed to get even more handsome each ep. And god, that picnic scene at the epilogue. He looks sooo unreal. Like a prince. So fucking dreamy.

This show really made me appreciate him a lot, looks and acting-wise.
Did the NIS and their human behavior expert mention wearing matching / coordinating outfits when you’re in love? [Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin at CLOY wrap party has me laughing](https://imgur.com/a/my2pp9g)
I still can’t believe Alberto actually died 😭😭😭
I was more invested in the Dan/GSJ loveline than the main one. Though I understand why him dying made more sense plot-wise it’s still so sad.

Also, on a completely unrelated and unimportant note, from experience as a former cello player, there is no way Dan would be able to carry that cello on one shoulder and still walk completely upright and straight.
Alright, this ending has confirmed for me that I’ve just watched the best kdrama of all time.
We got a bittersweet ending!!! I had hoped GSJ would have lived. He has a good thing going with Dan, and Dan definitely did not deserve that heartbreak :(

Also lol Samsung's PPL about being able to store messages to be sent at a later time, but it fit the plot well and we got glimpses of how Se-ri coped without JH.

JH's dad is badass by the way. He shoots the Military Director without blinking an eye but his face when JH starts tearing up after he mentions Se-ri is gold.
So I checked that Schedule Message feature on my Samsung phone, and it exists!!!! Daebak. Has this feature been there all along?   Nice job integrating PPL with the story line!
I hope Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin would star in an actual romcom that would not make you cry because of pain but of joy.
I am just gonna take a moment and say I love the women\* in this show and how well they are written.

* Seo Dan, instead of her plot line and her character solely being driven by hatred of Seri, which is what I would've expected in the beginning, the writers' wrote her as a whole person living her life. I love the fact Seo Dan and Seri came together at the end got second brother  in the jail (granted it was indirectly).
* The NK Ahjumma gang. When I first saw them I thought they were going to equivalent of the female bullies in high school but I am so glad to see them as wholesome group instead. In the beginning, there was hierarchy among them but by the end they were just friends supporting each other.
* Seo Dan's mom scenes in this episode were my favorite. I liked her character before because her scenes were entertaining but this episode showed much much more human side to her. Her scenes made to root for her. She took the high road when she apologized to RJH's mom and when she came back to village to give Wol, Young, Ok, Myeong creams. And finally, she is great mom.
* Shout out to Seri's mom for knowing that RJH needed to stay by Seri's side and also, her A+ driving skills.
* Also shout out to the older sister-in-law, its nice to see her and Seri being on more friendly terms near the end.
* ~~And no shout out for second daughter-in-law.~~ Edit: Shout out to second daughter-in-law for having a brain and a spine unlike her idiot spineless husband. Wished she used them for better purpose.

I just love how almost\* all of them supported each other at one point or at least respectful disagreed, instead of fighting mindlessly and becoming each other's "enemies".

\*minus the second daughter-in-law.

Edit: some grammar.
I love this thread because after two hours of crying, and laughing and crying again I don't have many words to articulate how much love I have for this drama (the cast & writers alike), but there are so many beautiful comments that encapsulate my sentiments
https://www.instagram.com/p/B8qExtYJL8t/?igshid=1cl8opmcic5tg

Possibly a special ep or something!! SR is wearing something like a maternity dress that we haven’t seen yet.

YES TO TWINS AND GREY HAIR
That flock of birds overhead symbolizing the ducklings in unity formation!
I am actually happy with the ending. Honestly, this was the best way for it to end happy but still make sense. 2 weeks a year does not sound like much, or enough, but it sounds like they've made their peace with it. 

Sure kids are kind of out of the equation, but that ending shot was beautiful anyway. 

Damn, so Seung Jun really did die. I think they dealt with his death pretty well. Dan was able to pick herself back up, like we all knew she would, and get the jerk brother in jail. I also love how she doesn't need a guy, she's perfect by herself. 

All the scenes with people from the village were lovely. This was a wonderful ending to a wonderful show. Definitely the best I've ever seen, and I've seen more than 100 kdramas (wow I need help). 

I'm gonna miss the chemistry, I hope they work together again, or maybe make a S2, even though they probably won't :(

What could possibly beat this?

I'm gonna miss you CLOY.
we're finally here \0/ last episode ;_; also, WOW this is almost 2 hrs. 

thoughts throughout the episode....

* Oh that scene with SJ and SD was so heartbreaking. I was relieved they revived Seri, but damn, how you gonn kill off SJ at the beginning of a 2hr episode >-> yall are getting some side-eye from me. 
* Can I just say, the music has always been so damn spot on throughout this series? I'm really going to miss watching this show. 
* Seri's goodbye to JH and the boys was ughhh, I got so sad thinking how it might/would be the last time. I've already emptied half a box of tissues D:
* JH's dad rollin in like a badass! "are you crying?" NO YOURE CRYING
* I really appreciate the relationship Dan has with her mother, it's so refreshing to see considering all the dramas out there with disapproving, unsupportive mothers--this is so sweet <3
* Soooo satisfying to see second brother and wife be taken down. finally yo we been asking about when they were going to be arrested
* Way to hit me where it hurts, Seri finding the note JH left for her on the fridge and all the food :'(
* aah the makeup products that Seri's Choice released ;_; I really love how there are still ways to send messages across the line
* I'm glad we still get to see SJ through SD's flashbacks this ep
* That exchange between the mothers said SO much about the leads' romances that I could've just watched this scene and understood lol. Once again, so impressed by how supportive the parents are in this show!
* New captain Pyo Chi Su! hehh <3
* HE GOT ON THE WRONG TRAIN YALL. This show with its continuity and self awareness, uggggghhh. that was the most satisfying drama kiss I've seen in ages. have my tears, have them alllll
* Dan is such a badass! 

Yo that ending thoughhhh, did not disappoint!! It was gorgeous, the shots of green and mountains and water and sunlight and our leads just UGH. (HB in that white polo, GUYS). Ultimately, this was the most realistic way for our leads to meet again--it was definitely magical, but a little bittersweet in its execution: "these are the 2 weeks of the year I look forward to most" or something along those lines... It's brief, fleeting, and mostly long distance, but I think that makes their romance all the more compelling; knowing they fulfill their love to each other with such intention, and just the amount of planning that goes into meeting again--it's more than coincidence right, and it's definitely pushed forward with a force like fate. I thought it was the best kind of ending :)

Wow it's been such a great ride everyone, waiting for new episodes of this show every week, I am going to miss it so much. Not sure if I'll find another drama that could top this <3
Not gonna lie, I didn't like the ending. I didn't dislike it either but after all they had been through, they should have ended up together for good, not for 2 weeks every year. There could have been ways where RJH could have stayed with YSR. If I remember correctly, he had a fake chinese identity which he could have used or he could have been made a member of division 11 by his father and stayed in Korea with YSR. Fake death could also have been a good possibility. I don't know but I really wanted to see them married, have twins and live happily ever after.

Having said all of that, this is by far one of the best dramas I've ever seen. Easily top 3. It had every emotion in the book. It made me laugh, made me cry, it made me happy, made me angry. Feels RJH and YSR took a piece of my heart with them. Their love seemed so pure and genuine that you couldn't root against them. Although I wasn't too high on secondary pairing, they gradually grew on me too. RJH's squad was probably the comedic highlight of the show. Every single one of them had a unique personality that made you care for their well being. YSR's family was somewhat of a cliched chaebol but the actors did an amzing potrayal while RJH's parent just go to show the extreme lengths at which parents would go for their children.

What a ride it has been. Thank you CLOY, you made my saturdays and sundays so much better. And screw you CLOY, because now I would have to judge every other drama compared to you.

P.S: In my mind, they somehow figure out a way to live together and raise a family in Switzerland :') :') :')
Just realized today that Seo Dan's Mother and Uncle are in Parasite!
I literally cried for the entire first hour and now my face hurts. Oh man I cried so hard at the separation scene at DMZ 😭. Goodbyes are hard my people. 

This episode is beautiful, I'm glad Se-ri's mom was able to be there to support her. And RJH texts omg. You can really see that Se-ri being excited/eager to wake up every morning to live her life, which was so heart warming. ❤️

Same for Seo Dan, I'm glad she got her badass revenge on and to live a happy life. 

This was a bittersweet ending for me. Having 2 weeks out of the year together is so sad to me but I'm so happy that they have a house together and were able to make it work.
I don’t necessarily love the finale, but I’m still very happy with it because it gives us hope; the same hope Seri and RJH hold on to in their relationship. It’s the best we could’ve hoped for, and the open-ended episode leaves a lot of room for to be together until the end. Who’s to say they can’t have twins, and are even able to figure out how to be together permanently? Maybe when his parents die, RJH can move to Seoul since he clearly has no interest in the military. I like the ending. It’s the perfect bittersweet ending that upheld one of the themes of the show which is love is hope and sacrifice.
There are already so many comments and i'm a bit late, but i just wanted to register my thank you to all of you, CLOY watchers! This has been such a great ride and I loved every weekend we spent together trying to encapsulate what this drama meant to each one of us. Hopefully, we'll be back with something as good as CLOY to discuss the beauty of life once again. Have a nice week everyone. 
Let's mourne with love the ending of this incredible drama. 
Don't forget to say 10 nice things to yourselves everyday, apparently it helps with personal growth.  

ps: i just want to watch it all over again.
Seung Jun’s death was necessary for the plot. Seri’s evil bro was going to capture him and use him as a witness against Seri. So it’s either Seri or SJ. 

SJ also served as a plot device to show Seo Dan how mutual love feels like, as compared to her decade long one-sided stubborn infatuation with RJH. SJ helped her resolve that burden and also to appreciate her own strengths as a strong woman. 

For the folks who are dissatisfied because they think Seri only gets to meet RJH for two weeks a year, I don’t think this is the case at all. Seri had been making trips to Switzerland in her search for RJH. In one of her trips, she first reunited with RJH after paragliding. Then she returned to SK and later made arrangements at work for a two week ‘do not disturb’ vacation in Switzerland. Her assistant remarked that she had been making many trips to Switzerland. This was the only occasion the two week duration was brought up. There had been no indication that the couple can only meet for two weeks in a year. So please, chill your tomatoes. 

This last episode is written as best as it could have been written given their circumstances. It doesn’t leave the viewer in a terrible place, or worse, with no plot resolutions. I’m glad it was gently paced near the end, with the scheduled messages and satisfactory resolutions for most of the secondary characters. 

Can you imagine what would have happened if instead we got to see RJH and the ducklings get shot and buried in the jungle after they returned to NK? And Seri pining away forever? Or thinking RJH is still alive while she was reading those messages? Or worse, accumulating air miles on Swiss Air Lines for decades with no reward except a nice lounge? There would have been an outcry instead and more tearful, depressed insomniacs tonight. 

In lesser words, I am at peace with how CLOY ended. 

Now, I can finally take out my rehydration IV drip.
nooooo where are our tomato twins???! :(

(although in the grand scheme of things this ending was as good as it could realistically get so we can’t really complain...much)
I don't want to start a who's better than whom competition, because honestly there's enough room for everyone, but I never really got the hype around Hyun Bin until Now! I wasn't much into K-drama when he was all the rage, then he left for the military and I caught the Lee Min Ho, Won Bin and of course Gong Yoo crazes.

But maaan, now I get it!!! This man is one talent you can't deny. He deserves his fans and accolades. Believe the hype.

CLOY is a fantastic K-drama. One of the best. Haven't felt this way since Goblin, Dots, Teacher Kim and the other great ones.
Can we talk about how that one song when the younger soldier was describing his home to the South Korean agent really hits me in the feels every time it plays?

The song feels so homey and I get this melancholy feel whenever I hear it play but I don’t even know the title of it 😭😭😭 Has the OST been released yet?
The moment I heard the singing beggar kids I kinda knew that GSJ would eventually die.
IT’S OUT LEGGO

Sigh I guess I was only half right about the [ending](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/f44r3i/crash_landing_on_you_episode_15/fhp6owl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)   😢

That final scene in Lungern was beautiful though 😭😭😭
So anxious for how this ends. I would be so disappointed if the happy ending is reduced to a 5 minute scene of the two reuniting and wistfully looking at each other. That would be such a disservice considering how intense the last few episodes have been.
Well folks! It’s here. The final episode the one we’ve all been waiting for. Thank you all so much for making this discussion space so incredible and dynamic. I will miss the weekly fun and I will miss this gem of a show. Here’s fingers crossed to a happy and well deserved ending!
I'm really happy with the ending, especially with man bok's. it just kind of fits for him and he deserves it after everything. a bit sad we didnt get the twins though lmao



**thread rant**: I don't understand why people feel the need to spoiler tag in an episode discussion post. Feel free to discuss away folks, you shouldn't hide your comments about the episode in a spoiler tag in its own dedicated post. Seeing blocks of comments hidden in a spoiler tag slows down discussion imo. People who haven't watched the episode and willingly go in here don't have the right to complain about spoilers.
SPOILER ALERT

Ok first of all... WHERE IS OUR TWINS?!

But let’s save that till the end and go back to the beginning for now.

Ep 16 is hands down one of my fave ep in the whole series for a lot of reasons.

1. I legit cried myself to death at the first 20 mins. Between the flashback and the conversation between SR and mom. And the border parting scene was exquisite. I couldn’t stop crying it hurts as hell.

2. I knew SJ would die, but the way they resolve the aftermath is very well done imo. I especially enjoy Dan’s mom and uncle’ scene, where they care for Dan as a real family like they always do. Dan’s mom is unlike those “My daughter has to get married to a rich man no matter she loves him or not.”, she’s so precious. 

And most people may disagree with me, but I think it’s the perfect happy ending for Dan.

‘She’ll be so successful that she doesn’t need a man.’ 

Exactly. Why does love has to be the only happily ever after? Why if someone doesn’t find love in life automatically means she/he isn’t happy? 

ESPECIALLY with her spending the past 10 years of her life being unhappy because of a man. That final smile she gave at the end is the most genuine I’ve seen of her. She and anybody can be happy with or without a man/woman. Period.

I know I’m being a hypocrite here as I desperately wish for SR and JH to get together. I do. It’s something everyone I assume, agree as the perfect happy ending.

But I appreciate the show giving the audience 2 different version of a happy ending. SR-JH are happy, Dan is happy too.

3. Dan and JH’s last meeting is so raw and honest. I do feel bad for Dan first of all. She waited for him for almost 10 years, THEN once again she lost another person she has just met after barely getting over JH. Dan’s truly a heroine, a badass, I can’t even begin to show my adoration and respect to her.

Yes JH was cold to Dan in the Switzerland scene, in a way kinda made me feel bitter. I mean, I don’t blame either of them tbh. It’s just how human’ encounter sometimes are, feelings can never be forced. 

And I’m glad that Dan is the one who showed JH his picture of SR in his camera. I agree with Dan, as his 10-year long fiancée, she should have been given the right for it. ‘You never fool me, I knew since the beginning’ this sentence Dan said in the hospital when JH got shot rings true in my ears. Kudos to the writer for giving Dan this authority, at least once in their relationship. She started it, and she ended it too.

4. Everything else I won’t say much. I’m glad that SR’s stepmom is there the whole time for her, although I still can’t forgive her past. Her character is the only ‘flawed-written’ character in the whole series imo. But the other moms are just brilliant, I love that conversation between JH’ mom and Dan’ mom.

‘We only live once. And they love each other more than their lives’ —this could describe both of our couples.

And how JH’ family eventually support his decision.

5. Ok now let’s talk about the ending. I legit was scared going into the last 30 mins bc there’s still no sign for a happy ending whatsoever. I kept watching the time rolled around, scared that an open ending would be the answer.

Of course Switz would be the final destination.

I read some said that it’s bit rushed. I think what the writer’s trying to do here is to give us a happy ending that’s bit open.

We didn’t get into details as of how JH could go to Switz. Yeah he went there as a pianist of national team or something. But we didn’t know how long he could stay, or does he have to go back every few months (from the epilogue, the ducklings were chatting about if JH has departed), could he travel freely, etc. No info on those parts at all, and by rushing it, they won’t really need to give us these answers. Exactly as how the writer herself (probably) doesn’t have the realistic answers. It’s impossible in the first place for a SK and NK to be together. Giving us this happy ending is probably the best she could do.

6. The epilogue, I’d love to believe that they finally could settle down there. Although the real case might actually be they still live in SK and NK on their own and meet every few months or worse, once a year or something. The house could only be the place they stay when they meet every few months. But I’d just deceive myself to believe that they finally got married there. 

Bc it’s srsly not a solution, you can’t live that life forever. I mean, meeting your significant other once a year until you die. It’s a poor solution in all parts.

That’s what I mean by an open happy ending. And probably the reason why there are no twins. With just the two of them, it may still be acceptable. But if they had children, it’s a whole different story. If meeting once a year is truly the final thing, it’d be SO irresponsible for the couple to have children under that circumstances. The ending we got is bittersweet to me, it doesn’t give me any satisfaction nor disappointment. Only a basic drama closure, but still a closure is better than nothing.

So in the end, we have freaking no idea what actually happens in the end. Only thing we know is they manage to meet again. And fall in love again, as SR said.
The parents & the NK ahjummas were really really heartwarming in this finale. Probably my favorite part, aside from Yoon Se Ri and Ri Jeong Hyeok of course. Also definitely definitely believe Seo Dan & Gu Seung Jun deserved better, but I guess we can’t have it all...

I am really really happy with the way it was wrapped. Yes, it could’ve been more but I was really happy with it. It was probably the best and most realistic choice. What a beautiful, beautiful ending. My heart is full ❤️

The last part felt more like Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin rather than Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Se Ri. But that’s probably just the BinJin fan in me hahaha I truly believe that their chemistry was such a huge factor that made this drama special, what made people tune in every week. They did such an excellent in bringing the characters and their stories to life. Hopefully we see more Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin projects!  

Ahhh I’ll miss Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Se Ri, the NK squad, and the NK village peeps. This will probably one of the most memorable dramas. Ever. Hope to see the other actors in other projects! I’ll be looking forward to it!

ALSO!!!! I’ll miss having the discussion threads every week and I’ll miss reading everyone’s thoughts, reactions and theories. It was something I looked forward to every week.

Thank you everyone! And THANK YOU CLOY for making our weekends better :”)
Anyone feel like their onscreen chemistry and love development is so real that there is a real life RJH and YSR couple living in Switzerland now?
I would totally donate to a legit GoFundMe account for a Season 2 of CLOY...like seriously.
One more thing: 

So often in romances, parents are obstacles or out of the picture. But this show was able to highlight the love between parent and child while telling romantic love stories. 

Seri finally healed the broken bond with her stepmom. And I loved how her mom convinced her to see JH off and drove her there and became a part of her life. 

Dan’s Mom wowed me with the beautiful way she described Dan’s feelings when she met JH’s Mom to break the engagement. Not only does she love and support her daughter, she also understands her. Dan is so lucky to have her in her life.

And JH’s parents are his reasons for staying in NK. His dad basically went to war for him and his men, and his mom was ready to die for him. I’m pretty sure his parents also helped him and Manbok transition to their music and film careers.

The way these parents loved and supported their kids warmed my heart and I wish we see more of these types of parents in dramas.
I thought the ending was a little too open-ended. At least it was happy though. When JH’s dad killed the military leader, I thought there was a possibility the whole family flee to Switzerland. That didn’t happen and I got hopeful again when Dan’s mom went to see JH’s mom. There was a lot implied between sentences, but I got the feeling that Dan’s mom was admonishing JH’s mom because he loved Seri more than his own life. Yet he still returned to NK to make sure his parents survived. It felt like a guilt trip. I thought maybe since Dan figured out a way to get Seri proof of her brothers betrayal, that maybe all 3 moms (Dan’s, JH’s, and Seri’s) would figure out a way to get the leads together again. Arrange a meeting in Switzerland or something. No, it was Seri’s idea to start a scholarship and spread the word through newspapers to eventually reach NK. I’m choosing to think JH’s parents got him reassigned from military service to the National Symphony where he could teach students and send them to Seri’s scholarship. That it was dangerous politics but they took the risk because he loved her more than his own life. It’s once a year he’s allowed to leave NK but better than nothing. I’m not sure why he couldn’t call her the second he was out of NK though. Meeting on a mountaintop is more cinematic, I guess.

However meeting once a year is not really sustainable. I’m choosing to believe they’ll do it for a few years before finding a way to make it permanent. Maybe one of his students wins the scholarship and needs a teacher there full time. I wanted that figured out before the show ended.
Long-time lurker, first time posting.   Holy pulling at my heart-strings, Batman!  I don't think I have ever cried this much watching a finale since Mr. Sunshine. Today I discovered the scar after a drama people mention in their posts.   
Seo Dan's development is phenomenal. She went from a character I understood but couldn't stand to a badass boss. Her outfits throughout the series were fantastic!    
Se Ri's mom melted my heart with that straight-out- Grand-Theft-Auto scene.  Her silly brother and equally ridiculous wife are goals. Everything, from the singing to each other, to the never-ending support, even when steered to do something,  to their coordinated outfits, is endearing and cute.  That hospital scene where he pulls wifey out of the waiting room provided some very much needed comedy relief in the middle of my ugly crying.   
I love that >!they all went back to NK. The show did an excellent job when approaching the relationship between the two countries; it didn't feel overly critical or propaganda-ish.  I lost it when they crossed the line and the ducklings said their farewells. I am satisfied with how they closed their storyline, particularly Man Bok's. After being told what to do for the longest time, and hating himself for the consequences, he found peace. In my book, he deserved it. It was adorable to see them get excited about Se Ri's products in the market.!<     
The bond between the ajummas and Se Ri >!(including Seo Dan's mom, who no longer saw her as the reason why her daughter didn't get married) and the way she used her products, knowing they may see them at the black market, to tell them that she had made it south!< was a great touch.   
The messages. OMG, the text messages!!!! Way to mess me up, CLOY.      
Jesus effing Christ, Hyun Bin, I don't think I can say anything else.  He was "cute" in Secret Garden but, holy moly, he is the man of my dreams. Sorry, So Ji Sub, you have been replaced. I will eagerly wait for anything with him in it.   
Se Ri's change, >!encouraged by the text messages, perfectly wraps up the whole series; love and vulnerability do not mean one is weak. A significant change from what we saw at the beginning of the series.  I wish she would have gotten more than a two-week per year deal; however, I appreciate we did not get the typical happy ending. Relationships come in many ways, and this is one of them. !<  
All in all, BRAVO. Safe to say, CLOY knocked down Goblin to my #2 favorite. FWIW, DOTS, while still top 10, no longer top 3. Hell, no longer in my top 5.
I’m not satisfied with this double life style that they have to live. RJH’s dad could have easily declare his son a Division 11 agent and he would have been able to live in SK. I’m glad they got a happy ending but I guess I was expecting more. 

Also did anyone notice a editing issue when Seri met RJH again in Swiss and they kissed? There’s a jump cut, probably between two different takes. Just a minor technical issue that I noticed.
IU's song is currently on top of the korean digital music charts. The aggregated iChart top 10 has 3 from CLOY, IU, crush and baek yerin's songs. Several other songs from the ost made top 10 in previous weeks. A sign of a very popular drama, but the songs themselves are great! 

My personal favorite is baek yerin's "here i am again" and kim jaehwan's very emotional "someday." I'll be looping the entire CLOY OST in my study session waiting for ep16!
Did anyone notice that they don’t have the rings in any of the Switzerland scenes because those scenes were shot first! 😒
Anyone else surprised by how sharp KSJ was with a gun? Like the entire drama he was running away and portrayed as a scaredy cat. It took me by surprise and it was awesome to see him protect SD but at the cost of his own life :(
This was my first KDrama and hoo boy, I don’t know how I’m going to recover. I cried the entire episode and still feel like I need to go sob in the corner. My poor husband walked in the room to talk to me right as Seri and RJH reunited in Switzerland and I yelled at him to go away. 

I was also hoping for the fairytale ending (and the twins!!) but I’m satisfied with how it ended. I just wish there was a way for the Ducklings to be there too!
Man Bok is too pure for this world!!! So sad about GSJ though ughhh

I really admired the NK moms candid convo with each other. Teared up when the vilage ladies saw what Seri made in their honor. Really glad Seris brother got taken down. The border scene was so stressful but ahhh. I'm sad she can't see the ducklings :( the Switzerland scenes at the end were stunning!! I was obsessing over Jeong Hyuk smiling the entire time, they both looked radiant af in that scene. 

This may be my fav kdrama ever
When Man Bok jumps in front of RJH. So many feelings!
Ok so i don’t think GSJ is dead. Dan only said he went far away when RJH asked about him and in her last scene when she was walking she smiled like she had a good secret, that being she was going to meet GSJ. And didn’t the fortune teller say she would meet a man to marry at the capital?

Idk am i just grasping at straws or does this hint at him being alive

Would this also act as a thing for the possibility of season 2??? It’s a Netflix drama so maybe they’d be open to it 👀👀
[deleted]
So this is the first k drama ive ever watched. I'm absolutely obsessed and so sad its going to be ending! From what I'm reading its only going to be one season   :( 

Do y'all have any recommendations for k dramas with similar tones? Or any with chemistry between the leads as incredible as ri jeong-hyuk and yoon seri? Literally a perfect pairing of actors. I went and watched the hostage movie they starred in together and they were barely in the same room the whole movie and still off the charts chemistry! Hope there in more things together in the future.
I'm so, so devastated. It's a mix of feeling happy and empty all at once. This show was so beautifully orchestrated, and sometimes I cried so hard I shocked myself. That's how much I got into the story. Well done to this team. Bravo! Dunno what I'm gonna do without you! Thank you, guys! Thank you so much!
Welp, now that the show is done I seriously feel empty inside:/
Not gonna spoil it but I am satisfied with the ending. What a great show!  😭
It's been a pleasure sharing the last two months of tears and joy with y'all! 

Meet up in Switzerland??
[since they teased us with RJH and Seri’s twins](https://imgur.com/a/UxrUL3Q)
So surreal that this drama has ended. Caught the drama on Netflix once it came out and it has been ten weeks (including the two weeks that didn't air). So bittersweet, I'll definitely miss this drama 💕
as expected i cried alot. For the epilogue i was just sitting with a big smile. Nothing unpredictable though id say i was gritting my teeth through the whole episode wondering how can they make a happy ending with a permanent solution?

Reunification was impossible and him running away from NK would mean his familys death so i guess this is as good as it can get.

I feel sad for SD but seeing the end of Ep 15 one character "had" to die and no way SR was dying.

Either way i loved this drama. This is the 2nd drama ive followed on a weekly basis. Which makes me wonder if this drama really was that good or if its just easier to consume the content when its on a weekly basis since its harder to burn out.

As of now it willbe one of my highest rated dramas. Now  except for it not being the ultimate ending that i wanted lets hope they are dating IRL because they are so cute together!

edit: thinking about it because i was hoping for another sort of ending the climax of the series didnt really hit that "heart" spot. Still though ill give it 8.5/10. Worth a rewatch sometime in the future.
But but they only see each other 2 weeks of the year in their Swiss loveshack?! And no marriage scene either and the twins are still hypotheticals. But I’ll imagine them baking in Seri’s womb and she hasn’t shown us. I bet they are trolling us because of HB and SYJ! Agency says don’t give them ammo to add to the rumors. Waah I’ll forgive on the rings given switzerland was filmed first and the sponsor may not have had them. I got SO excited oh there’s 17 mins left and they just reunited ... then came content from the other characters. WHAT
CLOY EP 16 THEORY:

Building on what I posted in EP 15's thread, have been thinking about the possibilities.

What's confirmed:
The studio had sent out for a casting call for a pair of twins, and they were photographed with the police and Seri's father. Highly likely to be twins of Seri and RJH.

My most likely theory:

GSJ dies, Seo Dan seeks revenge and takes down second brother. Ducklings return to North Korea but RJH remains in SK to take care of Seri. 

This causes the RJH's dad some issues but he manages to put RJH in Div 11. RJH and Seri gets married and have twins.

Hoping for a happy ending!
I’m still crying like??

😭😭

I need the twins. I know this is the most realistic ending they can get but for this instance I don’t mind a slightly unrealistic ending.. Just this once. The epilogue despite how picturresque and beautiful everything is, I still see the poignancy on their eyes. They both feel it too, how bittersweet their situation is.

I wish we’d get a special ep or something like the one we got for My Love From Another Star (a short trailer of our mains building a home together with their dogs) as the ending on that one was also quite open as this one. Please give us the perfect closure we need, writer-nim.
I’m probably one of the few people here who’s satisfied with the ending! The ending is ambiguous, kinda reminds me of My Love From A Star finale. I’d like to think SR and JH will find a way to be together longer or should I say forever in the future? It would be too cheesy if they ended up showing the twins or getting married. I mean, I would’ve LOVED to see that, but I get why the writers went to a different direction.
The amount of people who finished this in one hour is sad lol like how much did you skip...

It was a perfect ending to be honest. It's what we expected and they executed it extremely well. Any other ending would probably have caused a huge controversy. Beautiful drama from start to finish and definitely has become my favorite RomCom of all time.

EDIT Spoiler: >!inb4 people get mad about a short Switzerland reunion at the end. How else would it have ended without being cringey? RJH and stays in South Korea and they get married and have children? Seri leaves to become a resident in NK? LOL don't make me laugh. Thank god they didn't make the ending a 20-minute montage and them doing couple stuff. The epilogue of the house should be enough to satisfy your needs!<
I'm not ready
They deserve more than 2 weeks a year.. and we deserve more CLOY than 1 season.. i am both happy and sad. Happy to have witnessed such a great show and sad that I wasn’t able to see them have kids and grow old together.
Can't believe my first 3 Kdrama's have been CLOY, Goblin and Hotel Del Luna. It's gotta be all downhill from here no?
I really loved the ending. A major theme throughout the show was that RJH and Se-Ri just wanted the other to be safe. Regardless of how you interpret the final minutes, that’s what they both got. They can now rest easy knowing that the one they love is away from harm.
I’ve been screenshotting my favorite parts on tumblr and now that will end today. This has been such a fun ride. Hope it doesn’t force me to reimagine a new ending in my head.

\--

Finished the finale!

I'm almost happy about the ending. >!I was hoping they would show that Seung-joon's death was also a fake out. Tbh, his death seemed a little wasted for his character. It also makes me feel bad for Dan, even if she seems happy now.!<

I think it definitely felt rushed and there were too many things left unresolved. I would have liked a more complete ending than the one we got. Maybe an extra episode, or one of the earlier episode ending up dragging too much out. Overall, I'm happy with the ending. It could have been better, but glad it wasn't awful.
Cried like a baby the ENTIRE FINALE. Of all the k-dramas I've watched, only 2011's My Princess, Because This is my First Life and CLOY have made me shed so many tears. The post-drama feeling of emptiness is strong with this one. Sure feels strange to think that my boyfriend and I won't be rushing home at 10pm every Saturday and Sunday night to watch CLOY together 😂

More thoughts: was so upset when>!Seung Jun passed away because I was really rooting for the second lead couple to have a happy ending - but I suppose it was the most realistic way for that storyline to have ended. Him ending up anywhere else would've been strange considering he's a criminal. Loved how they showed Dan as a strong independent woman who don't need no man at the end, but it's also heartwrenching because we know the backstory. !< ALSO >!we didn't get TWINS from RJK & YSR like I'd hoped but the picnic scene was cute!! Perks of having a rich and powerful girlfriend - she literally creates a music scholarship as the perfect excuse to meet you for 2 weeks every year and buys both of you a beautiful holiday home that's only being lived in for 2 weeks.... of every year.... lol!<
A very underwhelming but realistic ending. My only complaint is that the in-laws never met.
To the people who say RJH going to Switzerland two weeks a year is the more realistic ending--that isn't realistic at all. He would be lucky to go from North Korea to Switzerland once every 10 years, the way orchestras tour.  Also, the Swiss gentleman who spoke with Seri said that  there were North Koreans in the program THAT YEAR, implying it was unusual, and not the norm.  So RJH could not just waltz off to Switzerland for two weeks every year.  And that's not even getting into the fact that he hadn't touched a piano in 7 years.  There would be dozens of North Korean pianists ahead of in line.

A much more realistic ending  would be if RJH had been posted to the North Korean embassy in Bejing as an attache. RJH's father as #3 man in NK could easily make that happen.  Seri could run her business from Bejing, shuttling back and forth to Seoul. It wouldn't be a perfect solution, but a lot more realistic than this Swiss pipe dream, and it wouldn't mean just two weeks a year, which they portrayed  in CLOY as all flowers and smiles, but in reality would be  a kind of torture for both of them.  They loved each other too much to be separated 95% of the time.

I think the two weeks in Switzerland ending was dictated by the expense of shooting there, which is very unfortunate, IMO.  They had to justify going all the way over for filming   Certainly portions of the final scenes in Switzerland don't make any sense, with the lack of rings chief among them. It was one of the most moving moments in the entire show when Seri said she would "never take off her ring."  But it wasn't there in the final scenes.

I will always cherish episodes four through nine, which to me were the heart of the show.   Once Seri got back to Seoul, all the fun and charisma of her character got washed away.  RJH's character was also much less interesting in Seoul.   Aside from the ring exchange scene (which really needed a kiss or a hug at the end) and the border scene in ep. 16 (so powerful!), the Seri-RJH story stagnated after she crossed the border in ep. 9, and the ending certainly didn't help in that regard.
Anyone else refreshing every 2 seconds?
And if fate is on our side, we'll meet again.

 This drama has had me anticipating every single week - so many ups and downs each week. As it was phasing into the finale of the drama, the wet tissues continually piled up. Although it's unfortunate I'll have to let this drama and the characters go, I let go with a full heart. 

 So many things stood out in this episode and here are some of the highlights that made me cry, happy, giggle, but overall, understood the reason why I had love this show.

 \- One of the most beautiful scene in the show in my opinion: when the moms were gifted with Seri's new collection and having their faces be the face of the new product. I cried happy tears on that scene but also tears that they would probably never see each other again.

\-  I love Jeong Hyuk's family. The mom will do anything to protect and see her son again, even if it meant seeing him in the afterlife. The father cared so much for his wife and his son(s), even though they acts very tough. Even though they were apologetic to each other, Jeong Hyuk's mom and Dan's mom had such a mother-friendship that was so beautiful to look at. It showed they both wished for the happiness of their child.

\- Seo Dan had been one of my favorite characters in this whole series. It was very sad and upsetting that Seungjun had passed, but her love was not just a one time thing and just moved to another man. So beautiful to see her grow as a woman and seeing her stay single. Throughout the drama, her character always made my eyes open. 

\-  The second son and the wife getting arrested (can't even remember their name). It was so satisfying when they got arrested and the dad screaming at the second son. Honestly, it was concerning when I saw the eyes of the wife and there being almost an hour left in the episode, because I thought they would do something again. Sometimes a parasitic and greedy relationship such as theirs has nothing on real love.

\- The messages that RJH left to Seri were some of the happiness moments I felt for this couple. 

\-  RJH's crew trying to buy shampoo was so wholesome, and they were so excited hearing Seri's name. I wished they reunited at the end, but they were some of the best characters in this drama.

\-  The ending; it was very satisfying and I finished the show with a smile on my face and a warm heart. Although we didn't get a lot of time seeing the two being together, the time they showed were more than enough. The last kiss especially was so beautiful with the flowers and the scenery.

Overall, this has been one of the best dramas I've watched in a while. There might have been flaws here and there, but those flaws were part of the drama and made it to be what it is now. I'll never forget the beautiful cinematography, scenery, friendship between all the characters, and music. 

I thank all the actors and the whole crew for bringing this drama to fill my weekends each week, and this drama will have a special place in my heart. The time I spent watching the drama were not a waste at all and I'm glad I stuck with it till the end.
Why does it have to be just two weeks??? Why can't they just meet for like, idk, maybe once every three months??? They're both rich and i'm sure RJH's father could use his power to arrange things.
Guess they scrapped the idea of Seo Dan's uncle being sketchy and having a connection to the Kamaz trucks. Sad, as that twist would've been great.
the most bittersweet ending of all time because you know their situation sucks but this is the best and most realistic thing they can do.
I cried during the times they talked about seung jun. He deserved better. So did dan. Such a sad ending but expected. 

This show really turned the bad guys into good guys and got justice to the true bad guys. 

This was such a rollercoaster ride. At one point tears were coming down my face while I was laughing. I'm glad the guys are back home and that the rat works under the sun now. Doing what I'm not sure. Recording nature? Eh, better than listening to peoples conversations. 

Also the new captain! Pobrecito! Hes expecting meat and a warm house. Boy ain't getting jack! 

I like the ending. It's as realistic as it can get. Otherwise there would have been too many hoops to jump through to get to where they can be together 24/7. 

I like that they get 2 weeks a year. I was worried that while seri was hanging out with people she would at the end of the day be alone. But she has that to look forward to. So itll be okay. Hopefully the post is released and that sad song is on ther so help me!
I'm a little disappointed by the ending but I don't know how it could have turned out any other way. Still an amazing drama overall and one of my favorites of all time. At least we got some good kisses at the end!
I wanted a wedding!!!
Noooooooo it's over :(( I'm  sad. I was crying. So sososo much. But I like the ending a lot. It's realistic in their circumstances. poor Dan :(( I cry for.


I'm pissed there are no sex scenes writer-nim. I mean. He trained his body. Let us see it XD men in uniforms tho.... 

Source: am straight man. Wears uniform
How can i watch another drama like this? if this drama set the bar too high. This drama is Excellent in everything. <3
I can't believe it's over. This is like the best drama I've seen since Goblin. And i'm going to miss RJH-YSR's chemistry and all the side characters in NK. I am satisfied with the way they tied the ending but I was holding onto the idea that maybe GSJ would come back....he fainted but it was not confirmed that he died until someone said it :( I feel bad for Seo Dan. I wish she had a happy ending too....
GSJ’s death hurt me so much, but it seemed right. He died with someone he loved by his his side and Dan has her revenge and moved on. I’m still sad that RJH and Seri didn’t get married/ have twin girls, but in my mind they do one day. Also Chi Su becoming captain is the most funny and appropriate thing that could have happened!
This might be my first 10/10 wow 


Seo Dan was probably my favorite character tbh
There were also rumors of [alternate endings ](https://twitter.com/poppypoppies/status/1229238161995288577?s=19) but take it with a grain of salt. Presumably they needed an ending that wouldn't suggest defecting as an option.
I’m feeling bittersweet as this drama has ended. 

I have affection towards most of the characters and really enjoy the development for most of them. I’m glad to see manbok is finally smiling—this pure man. I’m sad that GSJ died cos I really want Dan to be happy; then i realized my own faulty logic.... Who says you need a man to be happy?! 

I’m satisfied with how 2nd brother & wife ended up. I’m happy to see the ducklings are thriving and think of Seri once in a while. I’m touched to see the ahjummas teared up due to Seri’s choice. I’m sad to see Dan’s mom mourned with Dan. I’m feeling bittersweet about the two-week window that RJH & YSR meet annually because of how realistic it is. 

I’m especially fond of the parting scene at the dmz border..... JH didn’t let SR stepped into NK, the instant gun pointing by the soldiers, the NIS guy tried to stall the time which makes me realize either SR’s family is *that* powerful or agent is secretly shipping this couple lol. 

Can’t miss the message in the last two episodes that people in NK & SK are inherently brothers and sisters who are suffering til date due to Korean war. 

I cried along with the characters. For sure, I will think of this drama from time to time.
Seri’s step mum stepped it up today. I always felt like she’d make a good, steely secret agent. She always has her eyes on you. Details do not escape her. She will tear you a new one if she needs to. She has a direct line to and sway over the NIS agent. And she drives like a stunt driver. 

RJH’s dad doesn’t just put a bullet into his son’s killer. He pumps two in cold succession and all while looking like he’s just sipping his tea on a sunny day. The only thing which exasperates him is when his lovestruck son drops tears. That, he can’t handle. 

It also doesn’t escape me that newly minted Captain Pyo Chi Su and the village chief ahjumma have that couple look. Their characters are also quite complimentary. A natural duo. 

The merry-go-round swapping of the non-meat and meat dishes towards and favoring RJH was a riot! I’ll miss the NK ahjummas and ducklings.
I literally can’t stop crying! This kdrama is now my number 1 favorite! Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin has officially made me believe that there might be a person destined for me in this lifetime. THIS SHOW MADE ME BELIEVE IN LOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE, tbh. Loved both the main and second lead. I can’t imagine my life now without thinking how this kdrama made me feel all sorts of things. TOP NOTCH for me. ❤️

Also, I’m really happy that I started shipping Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin even before CLoY was pitched to them. I JUST CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF THEM!
My heart is full and I’m happy. 

Oh my goodness. This was one hell of a rollercoaster ride. I started this drama without any expectations, even thinking the trailer was silly and far fetched. 

I thought I would watch a few episodes and be done with it, but NO. I was waiting eagerly each weekend night for the next episode to come out. 

Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin were perfectly casted and their acting skills were superb. Omg that crying scene in the hospital in the last few eps, anyone? 

Not only that, but the supporting cast was so good as well. 

Tbh, I preferred the North Korea soldiers and ahjummas over the South Korea family drama chaebols. The soldiers and ahjummas added so much needed funny moments and comic relief. Also, Seo Dan’s mum and uncle were sooooo funny!!! 😂😂😂

Highlights from this last ep:

1. I legit teared up when Seri ran towards Jeong Hyuk, asking him to not go back to South Korea. 

2. AND OMG JEONG HYEOK TEXTED SERI IN ADVANCE FOR ONE YEAR BEFORE LEAVING SOUTH KOREA!!! ONE YEAR!!! WHERE CAN I FIND A MAN LIKE THAT? 😂😂😂

It is impossible to not fall in love with someone like him, especially when he’s portrayed by the oh so beautiful Hyun Bin.

3. Seo Dan walking off with her cello, like a boss, after telling her mum and uncle she doesn’t want to get married. If Alberto Gu was still alive, he would’ve been “electrified” by her girl boss energy again. 

4. All the ahjummas dressing up and putting on makeup because Jeong Hyeok was coming back from the military outpost and acting like the cold didn’t bother them. Lol and their reaction when they found out Jeong Hyeok was gonna be replaced by his subordinate. 

A HUGE THANK YOU to the director, scriptwriter, cast and crew of CLOY. Thanks to their teamwork and amazing chemistry, we got to fall in love with Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Se Ri and watch as their love unfolded. Hehe I hope the actors actually fall for each other IRL

I’m gonna have drama withdrawal syndrome for the next few days...listening to the OST as I write this. Ugh these Koreans~~~
[deleted]
I’m still waiting for the song that plays during the intro to be revealed................
Oh my god! The cinematography of the last 15 minutes was something else! It was so beautiful and I had happy tears! And now I want to go and stay in Switzerland and learn piano!

The last scene means they are actually staying as a couple in Switzerland right? 

I’m really sad for Dan’s couple but the last scene of her in red dress walking with guitar and smiling gave me goosebumps! 

PS: Please tell me I’m not the only one in tears for 80% of the episode!
omg omg omg omg I can die in peace now. My heart is full <3

I like the ending. Maybe its half-open ending? Maybe they're gonna make up something better in the future and for now the most important thing is they're all safe and finally met? That's what I like to think. This drama was really good. But my heart is broken for Seo Dan and Goo Seung, they deserved better ending :'(
Beautiful ending to a beautiful drama. Cinematography in Swiss was gorgeous. I loved that the characters stayed consistent from beginning to end. I also loved the women in this series. And Seri was one of the best female kdrama leads ever written. Smart, fearless, tough, mature, adorable, funny, caring, sensitive...she was the main reason that kept me watching week after week.

I love that they FINALLY revealed the intro song at the end...I've been so curious about it for the longest time!

Edit: Only quibble was SJ's death. It was just so undeserved and unfair in every way....Seri's dad ruined SJ's dad's life and SJ had to live a lonely, hard life as a result. He wanted revenge by ripping off Seri's brother for some money, and apparently that was so bad that he deserved death? Meanwhile Seri's dad is totally fine. What's the moral lesson here--never try to rip off a chaebol family, I guess?
I just want to say that prior to GSJ's death, during the ring scene, I thought that if this is a melodrama, he would die and guess what?? It's a romcom and it happened! 

(Anyway, Seo Dan deserved better but I guess one's happiness cannot be dependent on a love interest or marriage, she can be happy on her own because she'll stay fab and become a successful woman afterall)
Man this show really has my heart I don’t know how I will be able to part with it! I am little bit sad that RJH will only be able to see Seri for two weeks out of the year. I’m hoping by some magical chance they will have some sort of spin off where Seri becomes pregnant and that they will have to navigate having a family in Switzerland. But one can only hope... 😭😔
It was perfect.
I need like... 2 more episodes T_T.
I still can’t believe this show has came to an end. This last episode has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I cried my eyes out.  It was so sad but beautiful at the same time. I juts wish I could forget the entire show so I could watch it again like it was the first time.
So many spinoffs sound so good right now of some of the characters.
This is the first drama I have watched where I have cried because it is over, this has always been the highlight of my week and the way it ended was so sweet and I am genuinely going to miss them all so much, I don't want it to be over and I am emotional thinking about it, I don't know what to do with myself now
I’ve never really watched Korean dramas before this and now this is making me consider diving into the genre. I don’t know if anything can match the love I feel for this show and it’s characters. The ending was so bittersweet but I guess they couldn’t have ended it any other way. I just wish they showed us more glimpses into the future for everyone to make it feel more final.
Omg i am crying so much. This is my favorite drama EVER. Im so sad about GSJ dying though, just WHY
[spoiler comment]
I don't think I'm totally satisfied with the ending but, I think it was the most realistic. In my head, I've always thought to myself... _marriage signifies the happy ending_ but in real life that's not how it works. Them finding a way to love each other and prioritize their love for each other the way they did is the most important, and to them it's more important to keep their love than give up and find someone else they can be with conventionally in their respective countries.
I rewatched the ending and have a new theory. In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/f4mbuv/crash_landing_on_you_finale_episode_16/fhtxwhj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I thought they only saw each other for two weeks of the year. I’m not convinced of that because:

1. RJH says he got on the wrong train and reached his destination. “Destination” implies a final end to a trip. 

2. Seri’s employees ask her why she keeps going to Switzerland, if she thinks she’s Heidi. That seems like a strange comment if she only goes once a year. Certainly not enough to think she has a foreign man.

3. There is a framed picture of Seri on the windowsill from her contemplating suicide on the bridge. That’s not a picture you would frame yourself. I think RJH lives there.

There are holes in this theory:

1. Seri has enough money and resources to move there full time. She could hire a company manager and go. Maybe she’s waiting for a marriage proposal. 

2. Why would NK let RJH live abroad permanently? Especially after his voyage to SK? We’re not going to get the answer to that, so we need to speculate his parents and friends within the NK government put their necks out for him. Even after rewatching the show, I still think Dan’s mom admonished RJH’s mom for not calling off the engagement to Dan earlier and doing more to help her son. If they pulled strings to send him to NK, it makes sense why he can’t travel. He didn’t defect, and may actually return home once in awhile to see his parents. This is reinforced when the ducklings are in the marketplace buying shampoo. They ask each other if Captain Ri has left yet and they understand he’s going to see Seri.

3. She tells the hotel employee this is the two weeks she looks forward to most. This is originally why I thought they only saw each other once a year. Plus it mirrors the Korean myth about lovers in the sky (I forget the name of the story). But it could mean this is the longest period they have together instead of weekend trips or holidays. I’m not sure how visas work between the two countries.

Overall the ending was ambiguous. There’s enough clues that you could argue for either ending.

Sharing an interesting article about the NK defector who is part of the show's writing team: [Crash Landing on You: meet the defector writer behind stunning details on North Korea](https://subin.kim/4464)
Just finished watching the last 4 episodes, after weeks of considering whether to finish the drama. 

Man Bok is my most favorite character in the drama. 

Him joining the NK gang and exploring SK together, instead of being glued to his chair in the dark, damp room and having to eavesdropping private conversations, is pure gold for me. 

His character development is one of the main reasons I am watching the drama and I am glad to see more of that in the last few episodes. 

The scene where as he sobbed, he commented about how unlike everyone else who only asked or cared about what he has heard, RJH actually asked about he is thinking (or worrying), just straight up broke me. 

This is one of the turning points of his character. 

Instead of being swallowed completely in fear of what would happen to his family if he refuses to cooperate; triggered by RJH kindness, he decided to come clean to the team and fight the very same person who threatens him with the safety of his wife and child.

He has had enough of the same exact threat with his mother’s life and it had costed him the life of his only friend, RJH’s brother.

He chooses a different path this time, and every one is alive and well. I am glad to see these changes in him.
I feel like a kid on Christmas Eve. I’m so excited. I don’t think I’m going to be able to sleep tonight but at the same time I want to go to sleep so I can wake up to the last episode on Netflix. I swear this show has completely consumed my life this past month and a half.
Last 20 min: Where are the twins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?Wherearethetwins?

No twins. :(
It's 9:06AM EST and still not out wtf Netflix
The ending is slightly bittersweet >!at least on Dan’s end!<. I guess the writer can’t have as much of a creative control since it could be controversial and would take out the audience’s immersion on the story. Unlike LOTS or MLFTS where the writer could make up whatever rules she wanted. But I’m glad CLOY still ended on an overall happy note
1hr 51 mins??? Okkk here I go
Hahaha I am kinda underwhelmed bybthe ending, it reminded me of how Goblin ended, I finally understood what Goblin couple shippers must have felt lmao.

It's already midnight so I wanna clarofy something. Did that mean that Jeonghyeok and Seri only see each other for 14 days straight every year???? While it makes sense I am sad huhu
It ended the way it should have ended. Realistic, and simple. Although I was waiting for more towards the end like Jeong Hyuk filing for asylum in SK but I guess that would be good too. 

I’m just thinking that maybe Seri set up another business in Swiss so they could build a life together there. 

Overall, it was an emotional rollercoaster.
DAN IS THE REAL MVP 😭😭😭
So I think I spent half the time of the finale in tears. I'm glad Seri and Jeong Hyeok get 2 weeks in every year to be together. It's realistic, I guess. But Seo Dan losing Gu Seung Joon! Why! The writers could have let the guy live, and Dan finally give and receive love. 🤕 As always, CLOY delivered on poignant scenes. I loved that Seri named moisturizing creams after the NK ajummas to thank them and let them know she's well! So heart-warming! I loved how Seri and Mum now have a relationship. That life goes on just fine for our beloved characters, except for Gu Seung Jun. Or maybe he had a happy ending too, in a way. He died loved and being cried over by Dan. He also knew the answer to something he had been thinking about.  

I love CLOY for many reasons but I think we can all agree that the SK-NK connection truly set us up for an interesting story. It made us hope and cry and hope and cry and hope again. Also, the cast just delivered their best performances! Te acting was just amazing in this drama; despite my bias that the main leads themselves would be pulling the ratings up by themselves. Ye Jin can move you with her eyes! Hyun Bin's characterization of Ri with a soft voice, gentle nature, yet big moves is too damn perfect. 

I'm gonna miss anticipating this drama every weekend. I'm gonna miss this made up world based on CLOY. 

May there be real babies for Ye Jin and Hyun Bin. 💕

It's been fun redditing with all of you! Til our next Kdrama together!
And they just HAD to show it right in the beginning .... Also I was really angry the ambulance guy didnt even perform any life saving procedure..😡
Pretty satisfying ending compared to most other kdramas, not too many loose ends. I would've liked a bit more back story on what caused Seri to want to have euthanasia in Switzerland / depression, and how she bounced back to become a successful CEO.

Can't believe this drama is already over, not sure what I can look forward to anymore. This show was probably the highlight of every week for me.
Does anyone know where to get the song full song of "the song you and I used to sing together"?
I miss them so much already 😢
Satisfied but the trope part of me also wouldn't have minded the fairytale happily ever after. Hard to believe its all over :(
big spoiler :





>!they fucking killed GSJ. WHAT THE FUCK.....!<
Still abit confused by what Cho meant when he said RJH’s father wanted to bury the truth about his brother’s death. 

But in any case I’m excited to see how it ends tonight. I personally felt CLOY was on abit of decline from Ep 11-14 (then again it’s partly because they had set the bar so high) but yesterday’s episode was perfect in reigniting my interest! 

Hoping for a good ending tonight!
Before this kdrama came out I thought it would be ok, but it’s really surprised me. Probably my favourite kdrama ever. It’s hilarious, heart breaking, intense. 

Really exceeded my expectations and probably a lot of people. Thanks for the chats! Hopefully it’s a good ending for everyone.
I had no intention to watch Crash Landing on You at first. It's just that I got bored and tried to watch a new KDrama in Netflix. I have never been this crazy about episode releases and have never been bothered about reading/hearing spoilers of KDramas until CLOY happened. I've been excited to read/upvote comments in discussion threads. I haven't watched any HB drama/film but he really got me with his acting and I appreciated SYJ's acting even more. I've been listening to the OSTs and tried to memorize some. I can't believe we're down to the last episode. The last time I felt this happy with the leads was when I watched FFMW (I still have more to watch in KDramas, don't judge).

Honestly, I'll be contented with whatever the CLOY writer wants. I'm really fond of and always expect realistic or tragic endings (CLOY is an exception). >!I can accept GSJ's death though I'll be sad for SD but I'm also expecting RJH and YSR's happy ending.!< I hated some dramas I've watched because I felt like they ended with what the viewers want (such as DOTS, Goblin, Hwayugi) instead of continuing where the episode went (e.g. Yoo Si Jin's 'death'). I like the ending of HDL because it ended where it's supposed to be. Again, don't judge me. It's just an opinion. But yeah, I hope the writers of CLOY won't push it to the last five minutes of the show. 

OT: I think watching Itaewon Class will help me recover from CLOY. I'll miss it.
gonna miss watching CLOY on weekends, time for the post drama depression to set in :(
Some possible [spoilers for the ending](https://twitter.com/flipsidefeels/status/1228979938226667520?s=19)

Check the scene being projected during the first few seconds. Could be a snippet from ep 16.
Can anyone tell me what time the finale episode will be released on Netflix? I'm trying to decide whether to stay up or go to sleep and watch it tomorrow... while trying to avoid the internet because of spoilers haha
Just a few more hours til the finale. I haven’t enjoyed a drama this much in a while; I’m going to miss CLOY so badly. :(

Someone please make an additional thread on how to recover from this drama, cause I don’t think I can — happy ending or not.
I feel like i ought to share this CLOY finale party: 
(https://youtu.be/oHNXqA2qYEM)

Lol. I was just smiling watching.
So if this episode is 2-hours long, does that mean it'll be uploaded one hour later than usual then?
ITS OUT GO WATCH
Alright, goodbye everyone. It's been a ride!
where was the shirtless scene that we all waited so long for!!! AND ALBERTO... uwu
What an amazing drama. It was the perfect romantic comedy with the twist of roller-coaster feelings! Satisfied with the ending but my heart just broke when Seung Jun died. Come on, Dan and Seung Jun deserved better! It would've been perfect if they got the happy ending they deserved. Nevertheless, it was nicely done! It's finished. What am I gonna do with my life now TT
I didn't understand Man-Bok's ending!! Can somebody explain it to me? Was it ASMR???
Yesss!! Thank you Pd-nim - been a while since I've been satisfied with the ending
Call me crazy but I CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT THAT GSJ DIED..... The entire time all i had on mind was just that... Damn second lead syndrome is REAL...damn i need to watch episode 16 again!!
I love this show so much! I love it so much! What a fucking roller coaster of emotions from start to end! I love this cast, son ye jin, hyun bin and all the others, each and everyone in this cast deserves a praise of their own. Such a heartwarming ending, I swear by the time I got up from my chair, I saw butterflies just flutter around me. So beautiful! I'm gonna go into a depressive state now, knowing there aren't gonna be more episodes or a new season either. But I need this cast to work together in another project, all of them! Oh god....I already miss them.
Why did they kill Gu Seung Joon.  I can't live with the fact that only one story had happy ending. I cried a lot in second last episode and in the last episode. Thanks everyone for doing the review of the show
Man I wanted everyone one of them to have a happy ending seeing how GSJ and Dan had incredible chemistry, still seeing Dan move on and be independent is still bitter sweet in its own way.
IS THERE A SEASON 2 OR NOT I NEED TO SEE MORE OF SEO DAN
Can someone enlighten me about what Dan might have seen in the photos on RJH's camera that finally made sense to her of why he was taking them rather than looking at her. Before you say "Se-ri" - he was not looking at Dan far before the encounter on the bridge with Se-ri...so what was he looking for in the landscape?
I had the feeling GSJ was going to die based from the lyrics of the song that was sang by the children when he hid in the marketplace after being chased.
To all haters on why GSJ died. The writers only wants to tell us how incompetent and no medically modern NK is. Thus him dying. 

PS i would love GSJ and SD to have a happy ending too.
[removed]
So sad this drama is over. RJH and Se-Ri are so wonderful to watch together, but I really fell in love with the supporting cast. RJH's men & the women of the village really made me fall in love with this drama. They all play such a huge role and I really think they are critical to the success of CLOY. The writers did such a great job of making you want to root for their happiness.
I cant get over GSJ. It tainted this a little for me 😭😭😭
The songs used throughout the series were soooo beautiful. 'Sigriswil' by Kim young Hee is just perfect for the dreamy ending scene. Just listening to it tears me up.
Anyone else think the last two minutes of the series could easily double as a perfume ad?
How can I recover from this please someone tell me
Late to the party, just finished the series a second ago and want to show appreciation for everything in that DMZ scene. Special nod the art direction with how JH was in black matching the SK agents and Seri  in brown to match the NK soldiers/officers. I thought that was a lovely way of showing how they'd influenced eachother - this show is so freaking perfect.
I'm both ready, and so not ready for the finale!! It's finally here, and the anticipation for tomorrow morning (for me) is insane!

I'm just so excited, this has been the first on air drama i've watched, and I'm sure if it wasn't so good, I would have dropped it, because I don't think the format of waiting every week for episodes is my thing anymore.

So much anticipation, and like I wrote earlier today in the episode 15 thread - I'm really gunning for a satisfying \[read: happy\] ending for our leads, and hopefully the second leads too (though I'm certainly less sure for Seo Dan and Seung-joon, but we'll see!).

It's been fun everyone, now I need to find another drama to watch, as besides CLOY - I'm in a complete slump right now!!
seo dan is my favourite character. this is so sad but at least she's independent and looking forward

I love man bok's ending too
Wow, it's over. I'm honestly satisfied with the outcome. This was my first ever kdrama that I followed week to week and boy does it seem to have blown up over the last month, or what?I remember these weekly discussions being on the calm side towards the beginning of January. 

Anyway, I'm happy the ending is realistic, although bittersweet. I feel like Seo Dan got a bit of a raw deal towards the second half of the show. The epilogue in Switzerland was pretty much what I expected, although I thought they would maybe move there permanently. Still, a solid drama that's definitely going down as one of my favorites.
Beautiful ending for a beautiful drama! I can’t even count how many times this drama made me cry and laugh. Every single line between Jeong Hyeok and Se Ri is so beautiful and Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin’s acting and chemistry is best!!!
I think this show has the most realistic and best ending. I was sad about GSJ and it felt like they did very little to save him. Also Seri's CPR scene was fairly unrealistic with the defibrillator..
Is the episode already up in Netflix? Its usually posted at 10pm local time in my area but today its not yet uploaded
It's here!!!
ITS OUT!!!!
I'm confused! Do they only see each other two weeks a year??
After watching it the second time, I feel better with the ending. Wish it was but longer so we can see their happiness.
Nooooooo whats this ending T_T... So bittersweet
What was the name of the ending song?
Ok im sad that they only can meet 2 weeks in a year..........its just so sad lol i cried till no more tears are left.
On episode 16. While I waited for this to finish I watched Goblin and HDL. Please tell me this one won't kick me in the balls at the end like this 2? So far CLOY has been my fave and the reason I got into kdramas. I AM NOT READY.
Need a 'touch your heart' followup romcom a la Sunny and Reaper immediately with the leads.
I might be the only one, but i wasnt happy with the ending. Loved the show up until it did the time jump. 

And having captain ri be discharged from the army to play piano?? I wanted another season with se-ri back in the north with beautiful captain ri in his army uniforms! .

But if were not getting another season i guess i can accept the ending.
It ended! I felt like watching a movie in the last episode. It was a long episode of around 1h45mins! But it all ended well just felt it been so long! The ending GSJ died and I was sad! The ending leave a bitter taste though. RJH and Seri did stay together in the end in Switzerland, however they meetup after 3-4years I believe and even though they only able to stay for 2 weeks in the whole year since RJH only able to go there for a short stay. I’m not sure eventually how they will ended, it felt sad for me that they only able to stay together for a short time. Anyone have other opinion? I wish someone to console me 🥺
The cinematography, scenery and the quality of the OSTs of CLOY reminded me so much about the beauty of Goblin too! I absolutely love the "not-so-happily" ever after ending.
Can someone explain the timeline in the ending? It seems like RHJ had left the army earlier than Seri planned the fund for Switzerland. Also, doesn't RHJ live in Switzerland? or was he visiting? Why only two weeks?
This might seem a bit petty, but there was that funny part where RJY says that his favourite piano piece was called Nocturne by Chopin. Anyone who knows about Chopin would know he made many Nocturnes and named them by number (e.g Nocturne Opus 9:No.2). I just thought this was a quirky and kind of lazy mistake by the writers, but one mistake doesn't change the masterpiece that is Crash Landing on You.
I just want to add my thoughts. 

I loved this drama. I was drawn in from the first episode. I heard on a podcast that the writers/producers had NK consultants so that they could portray life in a small village in NK realistically. 

I loved our main couple. I loved that they found a way to be together. Maybe I'm just a romantic idealist, but I don't understand why they couldn't just live together in Switzerland. 

For what it's worth, I just get angry at nationalism in all forms. We all live on the same earth, see the same trees and sky, eat food, live, die, have babies, and fall in love. Somehow human beings have drawn imaginary lines on the planet and decided that people should be divided from each other.  It just doesn't make sense to me. I'm not an anarchist, and I'm not a stupid person. I love the beautiful diversity of the planet and treasure the many cultures. I do not believe we should all be the same, but I don't think these imaginary lines are good for human beings. 

I've walked across borders like the one in the show, although I've never been to Korea. --- yet. It's surreal to walk across a border like that that. 

I guess I'm leaving the topic of the drama, so I'll stop now. I will certainly miss this one. Clap, clap, clap, CLOY. This one moves to my top twelve list.
Damn it! It's been a while since I had post drama blues 😭😭 I miss CLOY so much and cant watch other dramas for a while so I AM REWATCHING IT!! HAHAHA
Who should we write to so that people in charge know we want another season?  Netflix, someone in S. Korea?  We need to launch a campaign.
Albertooooo, i am so sad for him he deserved a happy ending 
I feel just like goblin this drama must've had a sad ending, the 15th ep ending would just've made this show end especially but the writers decided they are goung to make it a happy one, but still the they needed the sadness factor so they sacrificed alberto and that was not fair.. i wouldn't have been as sad as i am rn if jong hyuk was the one who died .. Alberto had such an unfortunate life his parents let go of him his father lost his money and he lived inely wanting revenge and spent his last days running from death ... dan was the onely good thing that happened to him but they decided to kill him ... that was not faiiiiiiire ... Alberto you will always be remembered
Dan DGAF she's got a cello & possibly a gun in that case. 

So, Seri is just going to live life hopefully  meeting up in Switzerland every year?  I wish they could have kids but that would be sad too.

Also glad they went with Edelweiss as the plant that grows in the pot  instead of a tomato which would have been a lazy choice.
It is final Son Ye Jin is prettier than Song Hye-Kyo! 🙂
Teared up when Seri and Ri was saying their Goodbyes at the line. 

BAWLED when private Tang Jun Sang pulled up his finger hearts.
I finished CLAY today and I cried basically the whole last episode. The little things Captain Ri did for Se-ri? I was bawling my eyes out. While I wish there was an even better ending for those two, this one is the most realistic one. Still want a man like that for myself.
To the last second I hoped Al survived but unfortunately not. Dan's behaviour after that was great though. One of the greatest examples of chatacter development in the show - which is another good point. I do not think I have ever seen any show apart from atla with this much character development from all the characters. Just look at the mother figures! I am so stunned. I will definitely rewatch the show in the future. And hope that North and South Korea will be reunited soon. 
Speaking of which, coming from a former socialist country, the whole North Korea stuff reminded me so much of home, it was ridiculous. Anyway, amazing drama
Just finished this today, Seri's tribute to the village wives through her product's name made me tear up lol,  it mustve felt amazing to those four.
Seo Dan's crying at the bridge + flashbacks with Albert really broke my heart! 💔
I just finished the season. My heart aches that it’s over. Like I’ve lost a love in my life. Did not expect to like this show at all.
this is the first kdrama i have ever seen & im obsessed. this was probably the BEST show i have ever watched & ive seen so many. the plot twists, the writing, the fashion, the acting, the memorable scenes, this show was PERFECT.
this couple is much better than jung hae in and park shin hye
I feel cheated😭 no wedding, no shirtless RJH, no process of making twins and no twins😭😭😭
I just finished watching it in Korean TV. It was loooong lol but damn ♥☺
Since there are no more episodes left, will they give us BTS or not?! I need something on my Monday toooo! :(
Honestly it was underwhelming. I wanted to see the twins and why did Alberto have to die 😭
I’ve watched this episode but five times and my opinion on the ending has changed throughout my watch. I’ve come to terms with accepting the ending. What I’m not OK with is the poor editing during the scene where RJH meet Seri again in Swiss after she paraglide. During that scene, when they were kissing, there is a big jump cut. I understand that the ending was shot early in the production but still, there’s no excuse to have a jump cut that stands out like a sore thumb. Just cut to a different take at a different angle instead of trying to match the shot.
i thought Seri would hear about RJH being selected to be a pianist at (competition that I forgot the name of) and she would see him playing at his concert recital, but it was so fitting that he found her when she "crash landed" after paragliding. 

But where are my TWINS? 

Also I ugly cried at their brief reunion at the military demarcation line.
I know a lot of fans are satisfied with the ending for the lead couple, but I can't help feeling sorrowful. Seri and RJH only get to see each other 2 weeks a year. I don't understand what marriage can successful sustain that distance. I know they love each other but, a partnership needs more than brief moments of passion to sustain itself. I kinda think it would have been better if they ended there relationship completely so, they can find partners who they can build a future with.
Just finished (speed) watching it. I suppose it was as good a finale as we could expect. Without having spent a lot of time analyzing it, I think my earlier assessment that the writing took a decidedly different turn starting with Episode 10 applies here as well. The power struggle between JH's father and that other director didn't add up and was resolved in a rushed manner. >!Why bother killing JH at that point? Wouldn't a trial had served the director's intentions better, denouncing JH as a traitor?!< The soldiers' return to NK (this isn't a spoiler, you saw it in the trailer) was strangely uneventful. They don't even get debriefed, they just keep going about their lives as if nothing had happened. Okay. While the ending was in line with what I had predicted, I can't say I feel thrilled about it and I'm having a hard time figuring out why. It's a bit ambiguous in certain aspects, to the point it could be argued it's somewhat open-ended. >!In particular, did JH defect to Switzerland or is he going there from time to time as NK dictates? At one time, it seems it's the former, when JH says he took the wrong train. However, if he had actually defected, why would Se-Ri only take a two-week vacation? I guess it's not particularly important?!< So, yeah, still trying to figure out how I feel about the finale and the season on the whole.

PS: >!JH says he's going on a piano tour yet we don't see him play the piano. Missed opportunity there.!<
Is anyone else waiting/excited for the full OST to release? Still waiting for the song that played at the end of ep. 13.
There were many reasons I loved the ending, but many reasons I didn't like it too. 
1. How did RJH randomly take a wrong train and meet Seri? Usually the drama give sus some meaningful epilogue but this was like...random.
2. Again, RJH could have memorised Seris phone number and once abroad...secretly messaged her and cknnected. Its totally possible.
3. WHERE ARE MY BABIES?

The drama probably did not want to cross political lines, but I would have been very happy as per that Fortune tellers prediction - for the ducklings (and maybe somehow their fam) could be sneaked into the south and live there forever.
So were we really supposed to get [a Ri family](https://twitter.com/flipsidefeels/status/1229590681380741120?s=19)?
Is anyone ever going to acknowledge the fact that it was a terrible sad ending?? Like they are meeting two weeks per year, every year. That’s just sad. Like SAD. It was cute, and I cried because it was so sad. They were not even able to hold hands in public, they needed to hide that too. It just break my heart.
Really excited for the finale.. just wish the emptiness after the show is a happy one.. I hope writers flood us with all the cheesy moments we wished for.
Wow cant believed it we’re on the last episode. I guess its hard to cope up after this series ends.
I feel like I will not know what to do with my weekends anymore after tonight. 

This is the only drama I watch live every weekend, can't believe it's going to come to an end after getting to know all the characters!
(No spoilers please) when is it coming out on US Netflix? Shouldn’t have finished airing in Korea already? I’ve been refreshing so much aaaaa
Anytime on Netflix now!
Is it up!? Been waiting for both to be up so I could watch with no interruptions
Someone's been watching Violet Evergarden.
Omg when are we discussing about the finale that was. .......?!!!@#$!!!
SO MUCH CRYING!!!!!!
I’m so ready for this episode but I’m also feeling a bit empty because it’s now over 😭

Going to be updating this comment as I watch!

OH GODD THE TEARSSS
Anyone knows the camera model that JH uses?
Started watching it this morning and now I can't stop it! I'm hooked! ❤️
About to watch the whole show again with my sister and mum who waited until the show finished. Idk if I’m ready to go through this emotional roller coaster again
[removed]
What is the song at the end?
I'm crying!! I love how they made the relationship work and I love how there's finally a show that put North Korea on a positive light!!
What were the Swiss locations? I was thinking about going to Switzerland before the show and now I really must go!
Does anyone know what Seo Dan's revenge she was taking for or did i miss that part
This finale was so not what I expected. Where were the twins? I hope they show alternate endings and/or a season 2. I absolutely loved the relationship between Seri and her mom - plus her driving. I loved how they showed her moving on - through his texts, her company (how kinder she got) and the scholarship program. I was kind of hoping that she would have taken control of the Queens Group and not her older brother. I was pleasantly surprised on how they showed North Korean and how they lived. And how they got along with the South. In America - you probably wouldn’t get that. I want more - please. The fight scenes were amazing as well. ❤️
I wish I could say I loved how it ended but unfortunately I have to say I’m disappointed. It felt like the last scenes in Switzerland were just a huge flex by the show to show off their ability to film in beautiful landscapes. Like how can she paraglide among all those mountains and Ri just so happens to be *right there* as she lands, at that specific moment. It was too fairy taley and unrealistic to me. I wish they had just re-met at the Swiss bridge or have him play piano in Switzerland and she’ll recognize his music.

Dan deserves so so so much more. I hope she meets the most perfect guy in life.
does anyone know what's the website where I can find the official stills?
Can somebody please explain what was happening in the ending. RHJ got to Switzerland a few scenes before Seri was going to Switzerland. Why didn't they meet earlier? Wasn't he living in Switzerland then?
wait..do they really meet 2 weeks in a year? but Seri's staff implied that she's always going to Switzerland
Can someone tell me what song GSJ is singing in the car? Its driving me crazy.
The movies was so good that now I feel lost 🙂🙂
Hope they follow up with season 2.  Sad to season 1 ended.
What other notable PPL was in the movie?

* Samsung
* Subway's
* BBQ Chicken
* Dyson
* Range Rover
Can anyone give me the pronunciation of how the F5 address "Captain Ri"

I still cannot get over the Seri/Ri caretaker scene when Pyo Chi Su keep saying "Captain Ri, we are still here"
Who should we write to so that people in charge know we want another season?  Netflix, someone in Korea?  We need to launch a campaign.
That makes so much more sense!
I'm really late to the party but does anyone the BGM that plays during the bridge scene with the demarcation line, when SYJ runs towards HB?   


It added such a strong emotional impact when I first watched it!
I JUST FINISHED THIS SHOW AND HOLY COW. I cant the chemistry between Seri and Captain Ri is so good. I cant believe what happened to Dan, why did her man have to die!!! Thats so unfair. I really love the dynamic between South Korea and North Korea here. Not gonna lie, I lowkey wanna visit North Korea and talk to the people there. Especially since I wanna know how they live, like the apartment scene where they have a fireplace(I believe?). Anyways I love this kdrama. I really started 2020 with a good kdrama. So i guess it will take me a while to find another kdrama as good as this. 100/10 would recommend since its so extraordinary!!!!!!!
Beside the typical last - second everything works out thing (how the father found the executioners in the forrest?)

It's great they actually killed characters which made it a bit less predictable. They could have given her a violin though instead of that monster of a case haha
Initially, I had no interest in watching this drama at all for whatever reasons. But, I finally caved in this past weekend (seriously? I always do this after dramas end) and I have no regrets! I wish I watched it sooner, but whatever, it's never too late.

Anyways, I just want to say that I love this drama so much from beginning to the end - almost every aspect (did not like Cheol Gang, but we needed that plot line). There's so many things to LOVE about this drama -- Seri's storyline, Seri and JH's romance, how JH and Seri saved each other, Seri friendship with the ahjummas, Seri's friendship with the ducklings, the ducklings, Seri's stepmom redemption arc, the second step-bro and his wife getting arrested, Dan and SJ relationship, JH's parents (mostly his dad cause of his reactions to Seri & JH), and so much more. I was so emotional and still is emotional because of this drama. 

This is one of those dramas where I am completely okay and satisfied with the ending. It makes sense to me even though it kills me because of their long distance relationship and only see each other for 2 weeks per year (but our main leads are happy and love and enjoy every moment, so). I can't see any other ending though or else it may get very political in real life. 

Thank you CLOY for existing. Now, I'm going to rewatch my favourite scenes over and over again and drown myself in the OST because why not?
Been scouring the Internet for this particular bag Seri's carrying while looking over the lake in Switzerland (1:29:20 mark, can't embed pictures sorry!) with no luck. Anybody able to identify? 🙌🙌🙌
I loved Captain Ri but he seemed so unrealistic. How is he that selfless and detailed!!! Are their guys like this? Sigh... Alberto seemed more realistic to me. Good combo of both good and evil. I'm sad that he didn't get his happy ending with Dan. Poor girl, engaged for 10 years, finds love, and ends up single for life. 

Low key I wanted seri and ri to have the baby girl that they were talking about.
I fucking love this show. 

I'm so sad there isn't a season two! :(((
A month late, but how did RJH resolve his conflict with his dad about his involvement with CCK, which stopped the dad from pursuing the investigation on RMH's death? Is CCK's dying statement even true, or did RJH realize that CCK was simply poisoning his mind when NIS presented CCK's laptop to RJH?
Guys I'm still not over this drama and its my third time rewatching 😭👍🏼 I really enjoy the comradeship highlighted between the Northies, it was so heartwarming. 

The ending though I am a little confused and hoping some people could still answer my curiousities, do they meet regularly in Switzerland? I read around seems like many people got the impression they only meet once a year for two weeks, also based on the fact SR said her two weeks there is the best time of the year. But previously, Seo Dan visited JH at leisure whilst he was studying in Switzerland. Seo Dans mum also went to Europe at leisure (and brought back Seri's products), so why can't he go there more often at leisure as well? He is pretty senior in the regime too. Any thoughts?

Apart from that, My two fav scenes from the entire drama was when the orphan boy ran back ecstatic with food he got from Seri for his dying sister with the amazing ost playing in the background (i think hill of yearning?), and when Seri made products in honour of the ahjummas as that is the only way she could communicate with them - those were really touching moments and I could really feel the reality, it is saddening and is just a tiny glimpse of what is going in the real NK-SK problem.

I also liked the scene JH saved SR in the parking lot and he sighed when he held her in his arms, and the damn heartbreaking Photo in My Mind ost played, fkin just go ahead and suck all the tears out of me why don't u PDnim. It was so memorable, and then when she got shot too, that song again...hnnng Gets me every time anyone else feel the same? 🙋🏻‍♀️
I know this is a kdrama but did anyone else get bothered with how much they romancized the border-exchange scene. I expected to see more aspects of the political instability. The NIS was basically a joke. I mean Ri Jeong-Hyuk was not even handcuffed once while being detained and he was allowed to see Se-ri so freely. I doubt that happens irl. The writers had such a good plot and they turned it into a cliche soap drama. DOTS did a much better job at utilizing the whole plot (showing the importance of their careers/Private Ryan's arc) which made people look forward to romantic parts.
No twins!!!
The episode hasn't finished for me yet. I am late for my brunch date. Cheers!

He gave her the edelweiss to grow. [Here's *Edelweiss* from *The Sound of Music*](https://youtu.be/8bL2BCiFkTk)
I agree with those saying that the ending was underwhelming. They've given us such a fantastic development of the OTP relationship and such heart-wrenching moment of them being forced to break up and break apart at the boarder, and then all we got was a few minutes of them reuniting? Not even mentioning that he could have sent her an email or made a phonecall while he was abroad. It's not about wanting to see HB's shoulders (which would have been a major plus). If you're only going to show a few moments of them getting together, show them getting together. And poor Dan 'Fiance for ten years' :( Oh well. I hope their next projects (because they're fantastic actors) will have more satisfying endings, which suit the quality of at least the first episodes...

I stand by the Another Miss Oh nods. 1. The thoughts while dying/not dying/going to those dying/not dying, 2. The evil Eric Mun lookalike wanting to touch RJH's hand while dying and now 3. The guy recording sounds for films.
Geo sungjoon and Seo Dan deserved better. If only one couple got a decent ending I still think it should have been them
I'm so glad the second male and female leads actually got a romance plot. I've watched too many dramas where the second leads third wheel and remain single forever. I actually preferred their romance over the main leads and it was such a refreshing subplot.
extremely unrealistic ending imo. i really like the plot w dan, but the ending was waaaay too rushed.
Question: I thought the “crazy” guy the boys encountered in South Korea was Mu Hyeok (Jung Hyuk’s brother) anyone else think that? What was his significance in the drama? He showed up at the last episode too, so I assumed they would resolve by saying he never died and the Dad protected him by sending him south.
the ending was so bad. fuck they make Go Sun Jung character development wasted. when his story are much more interesting than the main couple. who are just obviously stupid lovey dovey.
yeah i think their dad split up the shares between him and se-ri, and he hired someone to manage the company for him, so he's just a figurehead. still it's so funny to me how se-ri convinces him to do things so easily and his wife falls for it with him lol, honestly they're pretty cute
also has someone noticed that they are almost always matching their clothes ? I think that's the cutest !
[deleted]
I'm a month late but this WRECKED me. I knew there was no way both couples would hold but but I still wanted him and Seo Dan to be happy so bad!!
Was looking at old reviews and comments because my heart hurts so much for Seo Dan and misery loves company :(
I think it was the perfect ending for her, especially given those gossiping harpy “friends” we encountered. They pitied, put down, made snide remarks and made fun of her for it. And she always put them in their place leaving them hawking. That was the fabulous part of Dan I liked in her character
'' Being single is the trend nowadays ''
meanwhile I’m sitting here bawling like IM NOT OKAY how are you okay teach me how to be okay with this PLS
I loved her the whole way through
Loved this drama for that
That Hyun Bin vocally sought to work with Son Ye Jin again after their Negotiation movie, gave me the impression that here is a great actor who knows why he wants to work  with another great based on the interviews I've seen him do talking about his work and his passion for acting. For it to translate to real life romantic partnership may be too much but it would be a welcome good news because I feel they deserve each other. Hay...
If I was him, I would be dumb not to make a move on her.
Son Ye-Jin’s performance was outstanding, you can tell she was giving it her all. I can’t imagine the emotional prep work that she had to do to get into the mindset for that scene which is why she is still one of my all time favorite Korean actresses. Her talent is by far more superior than some of her peers, judging on all the different roles she’s played.
That was the first time that I really thought about the political messages that were possibly being made. You could argue that our main couple actually represent North and South Korea and the fact that they should be together but, currently, can't be except in neutral Switzerland for special events.
Amazing skills on both HB’s and SYJ’s. Rips out your heart. Not only did it make me sob (and still does with each replay) it raised my blood pressure up (I checked!) He didn’t just want her not to get shot, but not collapse like she did after the NIS interview
Yeah that was a GREAT scene on so many levels and very fitting for the finale.
I cried liters of tears during this scene. huhuh my weak heart
I was bawling my eyes out.
They had so many moments that were great. The birds flying home and the agents and everyone mimicking that v  formation. I love this show
is it just me or does the super bright filter lessen the tension
>I am mighty glad that Man Bok came full circle, more than redeemed himself and didn’t die. His powerful last scene where he finally had on an expression of peace and joy at his new job, listening to and recording the sounds of nature under the legitimacy and disinfecting power that sunlight brings, really stayed with me.

I love your analysis and even just the fact that you paid special attention to this character. He's quite wonderful really. And his wife and son too.
Man Bok already felt responsible for the death of RJH’s brother so I understand why he would take a bullet for him. That’s the thing that was refreshing to see in this drama, the supporting characters all really come across as they care for one another.
I’m adding a scene to the series... Man Bok helping U Pil with his homework late at night in Pyongyang, with all the lights on.
Man Bok's actor didn't even look like how he is 50 years old alreadyy
God this made me cry while reading this remembering this scene 😩😩
Well he technically is.... loll
I think Seo Dan deserves her own season in Russia with cameos from S1. She deserves love.
I have a reaaaal soft spot for Dots as it was my entry drama (although it's kind of a bittersweet spot now as I don't think I can rewatch it anymore without thinking of the real life drama) but I can say that I've never felt this way about anything since DOTS. CLOY has smashed all my feelings and emotions and I've just been sitting here with cold spoons to my eyes trying to deal with this horrible emptiness now that it's over. I might need therapy. :') I honestly am gonna miss this drama so much. Sigh.
DOTS was got ridiculous, especially they came back from being KIA!  Wtf
Definitely!!! I loved DOTS but CLOY beat it hands down!!!
DOTS was full of troops and it was incredible predictable. For me CLOY is the clear winner.
Yes better script, leads, and onscreen chemistry
I saw CLOY. I’m watching DOTS now can’t really get into it. 5 episodes in and I’ve been leaving it in the background lol.
Thank you for providing the fitting context behind “Saudade”. 

When I first read your first two lines, I thought you were making a joke about feeling “*so dead*” now that the show is over. 😂
I had no idea what Saudade was as the subtitle didn't translate the Korean in English so thanks for the input! But I knew when I saw 그리움 (geurium) on the box, it meant "longing", and then they play this BG so... Tears and more tears. (I realised it mustve been shown differently in Netflix)
wow, thank you for this explanation! I had been wondering about saudade!

it really perfectly encapsulates how I feel right now, knowing this show is over and the story is done and as you said, it is an enjoyment that will never happen again, and my nostalgia for this experience will be ever enduring.
I really cried when SD's mom gave the ahjummas the goodies from Se-Ri's choice. Huhu. That is one of the sweetest gestures. It just shows how much SeRi remembers them and her kindness. Huhuhu. It really showed the sincerity of SeRi. ❤
Lol
 The in laws scene. Though it was not as emphasized as the house scene with the hilarious reaction fron RJH's dad - the hospital scene with SeRi's parents looking at RJH was funny. Hahaha. I find it funny haha
Sorry what instagram post/picture was this? Is it in the drama? I must've missed it
I can hardly focus on the succeeding scenes because he wasn't given the proper closure as a character. It was too painful. Somehow I don't get it, the last few episodes they made it a point to build a relationship between GSJ and Dan, and just when we are totally shipping them, he dies.

I mean, why????

It could have been another beautiful story and Dan deserves it more than anyone else.
That's a very low bar
I actually liked the ending of MotA! I'm probably the only one. But I also wasn't super invested in the romance part of the show. The leads didn't have that much chemistry.
I was quite nervous in the beginning of CLOY because I remembered being just as hooked to Memories of the Alhambra, only to see that bad ending. I'm glad CLOY ended really well.
Lmaoooo I was so hoping they wouldn’t , I haven’t watched that show but I’ve been warned due to the terrible ending.
Omg the withdrawal!! Now that it’s over, I’m like..”what do I look forward to on Saturday and Sunday now?!?” Haha How will any other show compare 😫😩😩
Man-Bok's ending was absolutely perfect.
Yes I was thinking the same thing. Why didn’t he call or find an Internet cafe and send her an email???  Not romantic enough I guess 😂
Yesss half of my imaginary picnic scene is better than none!! 😌
Yesssss. I even googled that they can use VPN to use whatsapp in NK. But it was only accessible in Pyongyang. Perhaps that’s the main reason.
I agree with EVERYTHING you said except the shirtless scenes. 

I think we got our filling with the absolutely hillarious scene with SG ;)
> - The way the intro was basically re-done

Was there a new intro for the finale?

Edit: I know it's weird I'm commenting on an old thread, but I just finished this show so I'm only looking through the discussions now. :)
So agree with Dan's smile. 😊
+ how the rest of the ducklings came into formation to protect RJH when he pulled ManBok away
Was it on screen for how Dan got her revenge to Sehyung and his wife? I only recall her saying shes gotta find the people with money and the killers
I’m sorry but who is the handsome comrade?
"Are you hiding treasure there?"

Audience: \*smirk\*
Haha this line was a good one! I really love that assistant of hers.
Right? if he had defected then it could have meant trouble for his parents and the ducklings. They also don’t want to send a message to NK that it is propaganda and against them, rather that things are different. The NK5 returned home and pigeon didn’t turn into an idol. (While it would have been funny if would be unrealistic).
Totally! I cried pretty much throughout the whole episode but at the end when I realized this would be their life... ugh... I feel a little sick to my stomach. This really hurts. 

I mean technically he can "safely" defect and be with Seri once his parents pass away, but that could be well into his 50's or 60's 😩
I disagree honestly. I think there were plausible ways of having them actually end up together. After seeing everything they had to go through, to not have them truly end up together is so sad for me. They'll never have kids this way either, unless they only see their dad two weeks a year also.
I really wished they meet in south korea.  RJH probably got blacklisted in south korea so they couldn't meet.
I agree that’s what I felt too! They only able to stay together for 2 weeks out of a year!! How is that sweet, also they met like 3-4 years since they been waiting each other and finding each other. I’m not sure how they able to have children and so 😭😭
I was wondering how they were gonna get around not being able to see each other/ be with each other I knew that the drama wouldn’t allow it to end with and they never saw each other again, so I was happy with the ending.
YES!!! Broke and filled my heart indeed!!!
Bit late to the party, but I got the impression that they finally got together in the end for the rest of their lives. Seris face also looked but wrinklier than earlier.
I don't see why they can't just take care of their affairs at home and just immigrate to Switzerland together. I mean that seemed like the plan for RJH anyway, to become a renowned pianist around the world, so he won't really be bound by NK, before his brother was killed.
I honestly just wanted them to get married and have kids living in Switzerland 😫😫
I agreed, I’m not a fan of this double lifestyle approach.
Aww, they’ll figure it out eventually. Maybe she’ll open a fashion place in Switzerland. Maybe she runs her business from there. I’m not at all concerned about the ending because they have hope now. And that’s enough for me. I’m ok with not knowing exactly, but I do know they’ll figure it out. They belong together.
I doubt her employees would assume it's an LTR if it's only 2 weeks a year. Chances are it's probably multiple times a year, with the music recital being the longest duration. Either way I'm sure they'll figure it out.
>I like to think that eventually, when they get older and JH's parents pass away, he will be permanently with Seri afterward.

This is how I see things as well.
You can blame the US and Soviet/Russians for that border and North/South split. If the Koreans did what the Vietnamese did and kicked all foreigners out of the country, they would be one. I feel bad for the people because they’re caught in the middle of this power struggle. Hopefully one day, there will be some sort of unification.
I don’t think he was a waste he serves his purpose. Another bridge to Seri and the South, informing Dan and letting her feel what being in an actual reciprocated love is. Dan’s “friends” were always making snarky remarks that she was still unmarried, and Dan could put them in their place. It is putting out a message that she is independent, no longer obsessed with RJH, and acknowledges that SJ has such a lasting importance/ impact in her life she would choose to remain single. Not bad for a guy who started out as a sly con
GSJ's impact on Seo Dan-- that the 10 years pining for a man, the things her married friends would say about her, and her status all didn't matter anymore because of that short but sweet (tragic but deep) time with GSJ. Both of them felt loved and I like how Seo Dan's mum saw it, that they only live once and found the one who can love them more than their own life. Junghyuk's mum must've felt the same way for his son and his love for Yeri. Such a moving conversation...
Yes totally agree 👍
>Their love story counters the Seri/JH love story - showing that not every love story gets to take off or gets a happy ending but such a love story is just as beautiful and impactful.

Except Seri and JH's ending isn't completely happy either.
Love your thoughts! To add on ever further to your first example, the coincidence vs fate thing becomes even more profound when her family and sister-in-law ask Seri how it was possible that she met SJ in NK, "was it fate?" 

"No, it was a coincidence," she responds. 

Because *that* was a coincidence, not fate, whereas her journey meeting RJH again in NK was indeed fate, not coincidence.
Yea he realized she was thirsty when she recognized his back from the paparazzi pics and got hubby jealous lol
I think I went through half a box of tissues :(. I did not expect to cry that much! I'm pretty satisfied with the finale, and how they were brought together (after a long time) by what initially happened.
The 2nd brother being in jail is Seo Dan's revenge. She made sure that the evidence which the NK manager had was sent to Se Ri through China so there was enough to indict the evil couple.
Same about GSJ reappearing. I knew it didn’t make any sense but I was like maybe he was going to somehow magically come back a la My Love From Another Star or Abyss 😂
Same!!! Wasnt attracted to him before at all. But now his character is my standard and he's one of my fave actor (looks wise and acting wise)
Me toooo! I never thought he was attractive these 10+ years until this season
Omg even the back of his head was beautiful at the end. Hyun Bin is at the top of my kdrama list now. Just wow, he was so attractive in this show
Omg. Felt the same thing at the picnic scene! Haha
SAME OMG I literally dislike SG and couldn’t even get past ep 5. I just found him attractive since Hyde Jekyll Me but his character there wasn’t my fave (not his fault tho), and Alhambra just did it for me, and CLOY is just everything
I'm actually quite furious at how little time was dedicated to GSJ's death
I thought the same about the cello thing 😂
It was a bold choice that I respected because k-dramas tend not to go there now a days. However, I feel like they should have given more scenes/moments with the two since they are our second leads. I wish we got to spend more time with them, but they gave a lot of coverage to the North Korean troops and the Seri's family.
Same feels! ❤️
One thing I love about this drama is how JH's dad was always one step ahead (JH usually was too--must get it from him). You could see how he'd gotten to be in such a powerful position.
>Also lol Samsung's PPL about being able to store messages to be sent at a later time

I have a Samsung phone, but I didn't know that was a Samsung-only thing. I thought all phones gave you the ability to schedule messages ahead of time.
Haha yeah it's always been there. 

It was used so beautifully in the drama. A whole years worth of messages. Too sweet.
I never know that feature exist. And apparently anyone with Android OS has it  😊.
Lol well Samsung is a sponsor.
I love how the women of K-drama have evolved. When I first started watching kdramas, [their portrayal of women](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/6uckxo/opinion_poll_the_women_of_kdrama/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) really bothered me. They often were spineless, spiteful, emotionally driven into toxicity and most of all, fickle. I had a really hard time removing what I considered "western" views and appreciate that they were from a different culture but I wanted more. K-dramas, like any medium, are a strong influence in society and can make or break toxic norms. I cannot thank the creators of CLOY more for how they wrote the women, all of them:

From the hopeless romantic who is also a shrewd businesswoman and manages to balance her career and her love... (when telling the plant 10 good things, she lists RJH last - he matters most but she has other things she wants in life). 

To the driven lover who overcomes intense pain and lives her own purpose without needing validation.

To the mother who was once unloving and her journey back to her daughter... And her badass driving coz f*k yeah! 

To the mother who knows when to step in and realign her general husband's focus back to their son over his rank. "You will not tell me to shut up when it involves our sons".

To the mother who's only wish is for her daughter to lead a happy life, regardless of societal pressure. 

To the female friendships, who rally together and literally save their friend and her son's lives. 

The wives who were the strong pillars for their husbands, for better or worse, and were not blind mutes following their chaebol husbands along. 

All the female characters in CLOY are well rounded, three dimensional characters, with ambition, backbones, guts, brains and emotions. They defied different and difficult odds to live on, no matter their circumstances. They didn't declare each other mortal enemies and spend their every waking hour plotting, instead they talked, forgave, moved on, embraced and loved... Hard.)

This was a beautiful show. I'd be proud to be even half of these women. Well done CLOY writers.
Yes! Yes! Yes! I love that all of the women, yes even the evil DIL were three dimensional! Yes, women can be kind but women can be evil and greedy too. They were all fully fleshed out. 

The women were all different from each other and their friendships were soooo good! Amazing support system. I’m so happy Seo Dan and her mum have a great and healthy relationship. Ugh I will always hold these characters (except evil DIL) and the ducklings close to my heart!
I agree with everything! I remember being worried about Dan being a villian just because she was spiteful about losing her fiance. But they really did a good job in humanizing her and giving her more. Kudos to her for living her best life.
yes!!!
my thoughts right now exactly 👏🏻😭
Do you think the political party that filed a case influenced their decision with the ending?

I would pay everything to get a special episode.
Omg these pictures are so beautiful!!! My heart!!!
whaaaaattt...? thanks for sharing!
What's the caption say, and what's this for?
Thinking back, I'm pretty sure they're gonna figure out a more permanent solution. She's got the wealth, and he's got the connections. And judging from the scheduled messages, he apparently already had this plan in motion before he even got deported. So it's not like this was blind luck. There's definitely planning, and I'm sure continued planning. With all this talk of fate, I'm sure fate will be on their side.
I like your spirit. If I don't like an ending, I, also, tend to write my own and leave with that :-)
WHAT im blind
I didn’t realize this until the Oscars. Parasite’s make up artist did a good job. These actors are very versatile too! Since then, I just can’t unsee funny uncle as the Parasite dweller. Those eyes...
Lol I had this belated realization too when I saw photos of them at the Oscars red carpet!!!
That was my thought as well! People asume just cause it ended that way it’ll be that way forever. I think the writers left it so open so if they do decide to do a season 2, it can answer some unanswered questions. But if they decide not to, I love the ending since I assume that one day once the parents pass away, they can be fully together since he has no family connection in NK.
Yes we never saw other family of his in NK so it’s possible he could leave once his parents pass on. I was also thinking that it could take some years for suspicion surrounding RJH to blow over to the point that he could spend more time abroad without getting in trouble.
After years of dramas this is my first live watch and it has been such a joy having people to share it with!
I was under the impression they only met once a year for two weeks when RJH was there with the piano students. But I like your explanation better and it also makes me feel more at peace with the ending now lol
Lmao IV drip
What is it with the twins thing that I've been seeing everywhere?? Did I miss something??
And those plushes! ugh
His acting here is way different. He's a force indeed.
Yes, it's "The Seasons of Us".

 https://youtu.be/DI1N0jcO0fI
Omg I know!! It’s like my body knew to prepare for some feels when that song came on haha 🤣 so good tho 💓
That was one of the most painful scenes. I remember crying when GSJ was crying.
What mythological story omg. Please refresh my memory! Do you mean to say there was foreshadowing of the ending from the earlier episodes????
I love your comment!!! It speaks to my fan girl heart 😂
Well there you have it, 5 minute scene of the two reuniting and wistfully looking at each other.
I’d hate it if they meet again in Switzerland 🙄 and they just stare at each other for the ending. God. I’ve hated the endings for Hotel Del Luna and Goblin and Cheese in a Trap bc of this. Must be a TvN thing (even tho they all have completely diff writers) 🤣🤣
You'll need to host a [post final discussion next weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/9kj5n0/mod_note_onair_discussions_and_recapreviews/) too
Thank you so much for the discussion posts!! They've been great to read, and see theories and other highlights of the episodes that I may have missed in the first view.

Will definitely miss these discussions!
Same! Thank you!
How is it here? Says "Available February 16" for me
Agreed, the episode is already out. People who comes in here more than likely had already watched it.
The best!
> Bc it’s srsly not a solution, you can’t live that life forever. I mean, meeting your significant other once a year until you die. It’s a poor solution in all parts.

The employees kinda imply it was more than once a year. You don't jump to the conclusion your boss is having an LTR with a foreigner if she only see's the person once a year. The 2 weeks is probably the longest duration, but I'd imagine they probably get to see each other throughout the year, whether for a week or few days, etc. This is a fantasy drama, and her ending up in NK via a storm and surviving this long without being gutted already is already implausible, so why let realistic barriers happen for the ending. If they really wanted to, they could just make up some BS "realistic" excuse in the context of CLOY's world to have them be together more permanently, or at least longer duration than implied.
[removed]
I wouldn’t be surprised.
RIGHT?! I know it’s unrealistic to have them being together for good. And the issues they are facing are truly something that they can’t do anything about of. Like it’s SK and NK matter, but still..

I feel like throughout the whole 16 eps they never really took action/at least try to come up with a plan together on how they possibly can be together, when they both so desperately want to even to the cost of death.

I’m not blaming them, but wouldn’t it be nice to see them actually ‘try’ and make an effort for their future.

Them meeting for 2 weeks in a year is not a solution for me sadly. Yes it got the fan service done, we see a beautiful picturesque ending, but I’d rather see a glimpse of them building a real family together with in a modest house somewhere in the world. I love this show to death and it left such a hole in my heart with this ending. It’s realistic, but could it actually be longterm?

Is not like JH dan stay in the national symphony forever. What if when he comes back to NK suddenly something goes wrong (with the politics and stuff) and made him unable to return to Switz next year or even contact SR about it.. I’m overthinking it but the ending we’re given is actually scarier than we thought it is.
> Se Ri's change

She started the series alone, depressed, probably suicidal, and probably have an eating disorder masked as intermittent fasting. RJH himself started the series detached of human connections. Throughout the course of the story they were able to heal each other, and by their separation, were able to heal themselves via txt msgs for Seri, and the thought she was healing herself via his msgs for RJH. So they basically became whole during that separation before they were able to reunite again, as their healed selves. It's quite beautiful if you think about it.
Yeah, maybe they started laughing again
Given that his dad is such a high ranking official in NK, I think both RJK and his dad's sense of obligation prevents RJK from basically abandoninf his own country to move to the opposing country like that.
Yeah it was jarring to look at I thought my brain was playing mind games
The music has been amazing for this drama! I also applaud the editor for using the music at the best times, for all the songs! Every time I listen to any of the OST songs, I think about the scene that goes with it. Right now I associate IU's song to when RJH and SR reunite in the hospital after she gets shot in episode 14. MAKES ME CRY SOMETIMES TOO.

I also want to honourably mention the incredible score (background music) for this drama. More often than not, I'm crying because the music makes everything so much sadder lol. Anyone know where I can find it?
Honestly, my favorite is the ending song. When those first few, triumphant notes hit, I got all the feels. Anyone know what it is? I loved the whole OST, though.
The OST has been incredible. I'm dying to know what the intro song is as well. I love it. It sounds like it's in another language, but which one?
Yes love the OST and I personally adore Flower the most! Actually feel that IU’s song is pretty meh but just getting the attention cause it’s by her haha. then again maybe it’s cause I don’t understand Korean
How could I not! That bugged me to no end & shattered the ending for me. Neither YSR nor RJH would EVER take off their rings after everything they had been through. Not to mention the poignant unspoken love that had evolved over 16 episodes was nowhere to be found. Maybe it's better to pretend they never see each other again after JH returned to NK. My heart is broken knowing they'll never marry or have the children they wanted.
This is my biggest gripe with the ending.  I understand shows are not guaranteed successes so they can't shoot everything at once but this was just poorly done.
What’s even sadder is RJH is an elite soldier but can’t kill CCG within 5 meters while KSJ, who only shoots clays as a sport and hunt for fun, was dropping 6-7 guys with his shotty.
I consider that scene to be his audition reel for an action film or drama. 

I’ll definitely keep my eye on what he does next. 

After the way he had to be written off his previous drama, I’m so glad he was able to ease back to dramaland with CLOY and got to showcase his talent with some really great scenes in ep 15.
No because he was shooting when he first arrived in NK. Honestly I can’t remember if it were clays or actual birds, but I feel it was hunting because of the German shepherd that was supposed to retrieve. It’s actually a really fun activity to do, I love it
I don't think we ever recover. As a user mentioned, we leave a piece of our heart with these kinds of shows.
How about when Pyo and Park Kwang Beom step move in front of Captain Ri when they expect a hail of bullets? Such a team moment.
Wouldn’t justify the heavy grieving process Dan went through though, there was no need for her to act or lie to her mum and uncle about whether GSJ is alive right? :(

Though they probably did keep this slightly open so that Netflix can greenlight a spinoff if they really want to
Yooooo I felt this too... esp because it would make sense that GSJ’s best bet at living a somewhat normal life would be to fake his death. Also thought the EMT in the ambulance was a little too hasty in taking off the oxygen mask and doing literally nothing about him “not breathing” anymore. 

Maybe the fortune teller said they parted ways and the “new” man at the capital is actually GSJ with a new name/identity hehe. As for Dan’s grieving, I think she probably found out like a year or two later that he’s actually alive — he probably had to hide it from her to protect her. 

Idk I think it’s a happy theory and I’m gonna stick to it because I was really crushed by GSJ’s death 😭
OH MY GOD
The second brother and his wife talked about SJ having died in the car scene between them.
You get the impression throughout the show that the JH we see at the beginning isn't the "real" him. He shut that part of himself off after his brother died. SR slowly brought it back out of him.

I think that's one thing I really like, too. You could see that JH and Dan weren't good for each other--both were too cold. SR brought out the warmth in JH and SJ brought out the warmth in Dan.
I noticed the difference; like we are seeing HB and SYJ more of themselves vs their characters during those scenes. Why? Because they had mentioned how difficult it was to put yourself in different mindsets and timelines. So they had yet to go on the full character journey. They filmed the switzerland location scenes first, including the ending.

Also both characters are free to express their relationship there. Without fear or press
I felt it too. It felt more like a bts photoshoot. I'm guessing it's because they shot these scenes first and the sizzling chemistry they have takes time to build and only happened when they got back to SK to shoot the majority of the show.

But in a way, I justified it as the real Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin couple spending time together instead of their characters. I totally ship them even though it seems they're Just friends only judging from the bts and interviews.
I guess it's also because we're seeing the pianist RJH, not the soldier RJH?
Hyun Bin hasn’t fully gotten into his role yet during early filming. He’s a slow burner.
The hair!!! And maybe because he's truly happy holding SYJ's hand?! A fan can dream.
I agree!! it didn’t seem 100% RJH in the Switzerland scenes, but maybe it’s just the hair 😂
I don't have any to recommend as Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin has really shown first class chemistry. But I'm replying just to say that after their movie, Hyun Bin acknowledged that since they shot their scenes separately and as you said "barely in the same room", he did actually wish or requested to have another project to work with the incredible Son Ye Jin-- which was granted quicker than he expected. They were looking forward to doing this. And when two dedicated artists meet, it's just marvelous. Ah.. I don't know how they'd be able to do another masterpiece like this together though I could only wish, too.
Ahhh you chose a really really good drama as your first, I think CLOY is going to be the top 2019/2020 for a lot of kdrama fans, me included. As for recommendation, I always recommend Fight My Way to other people, even my friends who don’t like cute romantic stuff have to admit that they enjoy the series a lot because the relatable plot line and chemistry among the 2 couples. It’s really cute but not cheesy at all!
Recommendation: Healer, My Love from another star (same writer), The King 2 Heart, The Greatest Love, I am not a robot. descendants of the sun, suspicious partner. The stories may be a little different but the couple has great chemistry.
Hotel Del Luna!
[deleted]
Same. I am satisfied as well. I let the writer have her way and I cant say any other way to end it. I feel like I was reading a book and that is how the writer has to end it. It was realistic. And sweet. And memorable. And full of gratefulness to the north korea people. Gosh.
I can’t watch until tonight, but glad to hear that you are satisfied. I guess it’s a happy ending then. ;)
I’ll look for the wrong train.
Let’s go!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
that's funny!
Ahh, I can't handle GSJ dying...he went through so much hardship in his life and suffered so much, and then he meets a woman he loves only to die like that? It's just too cruel... :(
no twins we are all trolled
It makes sense that you found the ending similar to My Love from Another Star in its ambiguity lol both shows had the same writer (Park Ji-eun)
Agree. Do not speed watch. The episode almost is the answer to all the questions of the past. ❤
I was not ready and I will never be 😭😭😭😭
Really hope there’s a season 2 and the ending actually allows a season 2
Watch Reply 1988, My love from the star (same the writer of CLOY), they're as great as those. These 5 drama (included 3 you named) are my favourite of all time.
Besides the ones already recommended, I also suggest Healer. Amazing story with great action and pacing and ofc, scintillating chemistry between the leads
When The Camellia Blooms won’t fail you.
dramas from the Goblin writer are all great my fav is Mr.Sunshine you should watch!
Yes, they set the bar really high.
Try Strong Girl Bong Soon next :)
No. Watch mr sunshine the cinematography is amazing. Also until CLOY, the only drama that made me cry! And incredible character development and use of symbolism
For me best so far is Something in the rain.
I highly recommend My Mister (IU's drama) as well. I personally like it even more than Hotel Del Luna, plot and depth wise. Give it a try.
Master’s Sun was good for me.
I would highly recommend Chicago Typewriter. This is the top drama on my list before CLOY happened. Now it's on the second spot, followed by Goblin. It has a good OST like CLOY, and it's also full of funny, heartwarming, and heartbreaking scenes. :)

CLOY and Chicago Typewriter are so far just the two dramas I've seen that make me want to ugly cry just by hearing the songs.
Itaewon Class has been killer for me
That would be interesting, the moms I can see getting along but the dads are both powerhouses; one old school military and the other business conman. Only if we got a season 2, where grandkids are brought into the picture.
I couldn’t agree more, people argue about this being realistic, realistically they would be glad to even be allow traveling out of NK. That country is basically on LOCK DOWN. This show is a fictional show, it could have ended any way they wanted, it’s all a matter of taking a risk and doing it.
And another thing.  Dan's mother seemed to be able to travel abroad pretty much whenever she wanted.  And the wedding dress woman apparently traveled abroad a lot as well.  Accepting that as the reality for some North Koreans (I've no idea whether it is or not, but they do have their own international airline, so somebody is filling those seats), RJH could at least go to China on a fairly regular basis and meet Seri there.  Again, if they were going to make RJH's father so powerful in this story, they might as well have him facilitate RJH's travel abroad to be with Seri.
Episodes 6, 7, and 9 were the best for me. It had everything I needed in the drama - tension, romance, humor, some catharsis. The villains overstayed in SK, tbh.
You're not wrong. If they had gone with the original ending as planned (at least according to netizens) he would have defected, married Se-ri, had a family and they would have lived in Switzerland. 

i've read the lack of rings (which was the first thing I noticed as well) seemed to be a continuity error given that the Swiss scenes were shot first - although I also noticed the lack of rings at the border transfer.
Me too! Hahaha
Meeeeeeee hahaha. Wanna watch it before it gets too late :(
It's available NOW!!
It’s out! And I can’t watch it because we don’t have electricity :(
Some NK people (at least within the world of CLOY) leave NK all the time. Dan's mother, for example.  RJH's father is a lot more powerful than her. He could have arranged for RJH to be Division 11, or whatever it took for RJH to go abroad and be with Seri.  

The writers could have easily gone that route, but didn't have the guts, I guess.
Or at least rings again...
I’m in the same boat, it’s hard to watch anything else. I hope they reunite for another drama...soon as I’m already having withdrawal problems knowing that next weekend, we won’t be getting any new episodes.
I was wondering if they might have filmed alternate endings. 

IMHO, they had a "wedding" of sorts with the private exchange of the couple rings in her bedroom...although neither one were wearing them in the end Swiss scene which makes me anxious to no end. I get it was most likely a continuity error but that means the bedroom scene may not have been contemplated when they were filming in Switzerland...just a thought.
I hate this withdrawal syndrome but I also love it... It just means the drama was good haaha
NGL I am SUPER glad they did not end it like this. That would be way too much, bring up too many questions, and detach from how we remember the beautiful couple the way they are now. That feels more like a cliche American movie ending as opposed to a kdrama ending IMO
I wouldn't have even minded a old newspaper or photograph in this idea gently hinting that reunification had occurred, so you know eventually everyone ended up together.
Fuck! They missed the chance to do this but something tells me there might be a season 2 for that!
If you want to see RJH AND Seri as senior citizens watch the swindlers where HB wears old man prosthetics in one scene, and SYJ as an elderly princess Doek-Hye when she finally returns to Korea. Then use your imagination; that’s what my mind flashed to when they talked about it whilst drunk
Hoping it would have a sequel even just a full-length film. :(
Sigriswil - Kim Kyoung Hee (it's on Spotify)
Same! Anyone know what it is?
I don't think JH is in Switzerland most of the time, he just goes for that concert performance. But yeah, you'd think between his father's connections and SR's money they could figure out more than 2 weeks/year.
I think he can only come once a year to participate in the scholarship. That must’ve been his student performing.
And how FABULOUS did she look with that red dress and her instrument upon her back?!

She'll star with my man Song Seung Heon [in Shall We Eat Dinner Together](https://www.soompi.com/article/1382820wpp/seo-ji-hye-confirmed-to-star-alongside-song-seung-heon-in-upcoming-mbc-romance-drama)?
We all need to petition Netflix to co-produce a season 2 with TvN/Studio Dragon. That’s the only we can get a season 2.
I'd give anything to see the ducklings again
Me tooo!!! OST on repeat lol
Interesting article.  Thanks for the link.
Omg SAME. It's actually 3am where I am right now, and I'm trying to see if there are any snippets of updates even though there's only 4 hours left until the finale airs LOL.
Don’t worry, for only seeing each other 2 weeks out of an entire year, babies will come sooner or later. We just have to use our imagination. 😁
It's torture
I am wondering too!!!
I actually really liked Dan's ending. She doesn't let it ruin her life and is instead portrayed as strong and independent.
It’s a good ending, I think it was the most realistic ending they can do tbh.
Can i upvote because ure right, but downvote because i also hate the guy
The reason why she wanted to have euthanasia was because she felt like she wasn’t fully accepted by her family (being an illegitimate child and all). She bounced back to become a successful CEO after her trip to Switzerland where she learned paragliding and learned to appreciate life :) that’s how I interpreted it! Haha
There are 2 versions:

“Photo of my mind” by Song Ga-In

“Hill of Yearning” by April 2nd
Having had a deeper think, the ending reminds me of Goblin. Some people will dislike this, I also struggle with such finales. Bittersweet and open, you know they will be together but the how's and when's are left up to your imagination. Perhaps reunification eventually happens or you craft they made a permanent home in Switzerland.
they built that redemption arc for him just to kill him in the end wtf
Yeeeep,>! second lead syndrome.!<

>!Was hoping he'd pull through....!<

&#x200B;

That said, you can actually spoiler that. Still a bit early for the rest to finish watching
I WAS SO PISSED ABOUT IT. I LIKED HIM.
probably just to mess with RJH mind or that RJH father does benefit from Cho illegal activity.
i'm a bit confused to why RJH wanted to kill himself..does anyone understand that part?
Itaewon Class is absolutely brilliant even though it starts a bit slowly. Keep persisting!
Where did these come from!!!
I normally see it uploaded at 11PM Korea Standard Time..
Australia? Usually midnight but fair warning the finale is two hours.
Usually 10pm, Philippines Time ❤
How are they not blinded by the flashes 😂
Um... who are those kids at the beginning?
Sooo many flashes lol
Is it two hours long? I checked the tvn schedule and it's supposed to end at 10:40 so I think it's the usual.
Is the military director supposed to strip him down in a strip search? lol
Instead of secretly listening to people talk, he is now recording natural sound for broadcasting. You can tell how happy he is working under the sun instead of in the dark. Just my understanding.
He is now what is called [a foley technician!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking) Recording the air is a type of ambient sound to be added post-production.
Thanks for all the responses guys, got it.
He deserved better!!! I couldn't stop crying TT
The actress has a new drama in the works where she is the lead
I think it’s just a general comment that he wasn’t really trying to put his heart into making their relationship work, hence he rather look at the sceneries than her?

And then when she saw Seri being in one of the photos and how she was the only person Junghyuk voluntarily took a photo of, she realize it was “destiny” that the two of them were fated to meet and ultimately end up together.
I thought it was more of a redemption arc than anything? Plus he died en route to a hospital, pretty sure SK ambulances couldn't do anything either.
They didn’t even try CPR on GSJ in the ambulance. Wonder why?
I know. I am sustaining myself on BTS clips and youtube compilation videos
Congrats on ur first on air drama! Gosh, I don’t even remember what my first one was. I always had this negative feeling about having to wait for dramas but as I got busier and busier as I grew up, on-air dramas have become something I look forward to, no matter the day they are aired. Thankfully CLOY is aired on a Sat-Sun so I really looked forward for the weekend with this one.
Man Bok is finally able to use his talent for something other than wiretapping.
Yeah I would have been more happy if it was permanent move to Swiss versus them living a double lifestyle. But at least they’re together 2 weeks out of an entire year.
Exactly! There’s no sense of urgency for the medic team when her line went flat. And when defibrillating, the doctor should’ve said “clear!”
Same here... I think it may be something to do with the EP being 2 hours?
Yes. Two weeks is all they get.
[deleted]
Your balls will remain untouched.

Well... maybe a slight squeeze, but they’ll bounce back.
I think it was really well done. Everyone is a critic with complaints of course but even with that there aren't many. The universal consensus seems to be that it was good.

I think you will survive to watch more kdramas :-) Your first three are among the very best that there are though. I guess you could consider that you're arriving at a very good time for the quality of kdramas. Congrats and enjoy :-)
I need a follow up romcom with Dan and Seungjoon
I also didn’t enjoy the ending, you’re not alone.
https://www.instagram.com/p/B8prnkBnTM4/?igshid=1b4r9pjza3q3k 

If it helps, the official photographer posted this with a caption implying they really do settle down in Switzerland
Huh! I felt this strongly also!

The classical music pro v amateur joke is made between them twice- first when they first talk about it, YSR says: *I'm quite good at the piano too, I can play Fuer Elise without the music* and when they are in the boat on the first failed attempt to escape, RJH says: *As I'm never going to see you again, let me tell you NOT to say you're good at the piano because you can play Fuer Elise without the music* and in the last episode, when the piano student is performing Debussy's Clair de Lune and RJH comes in late- YSR says *He's just started* and RJH says *I know* - so these are things that are intended to show that RJH is the pro musician and YSR is the amateur. So it makes no sense he did not at LEAST say Nocturne No 2 (because I bet the one they want you to think of is indeed that one, Op 9 No.2, although a pro pianist probably has a different favourite nocturne.
Is there a podcast about CLOY?
BAWLED. the entire time.
Yees :( wanna see him nakeed
So it just ended which means it might take a while for netflix ugh
I appreciate the lack of spoilers in this comment
good?
How would you rate it?
I agree.  This is not a happy ending.  I suppose one could justify it by saying they are waiting for reunification, but no one reasonably expects that to happen.
The wrong train line might be a call-back to ep.5, where SR and RJH were camped out at the NK train, and SR said there’s an Indian proverb about taking the wrong train but ending up in the right station.
Yea same. I’ll need time to ruminate on the finale to see how I really feel. You can definitely tell that the writing took a different turn than what was originally planned. This is one of the rare occasions where I feel like the show would’ve benefited from having extra episodes since there were so many characters and arcs to resolve. OR they could’ve resolved certain plot points (like the main villain and Seri’s brother) a little earlier. Then there’d be time to develop the other relationships
I think the other director knew he was not going to win the case considering JH's dad high-rank and position and the fact that he (JH's dad) will not let his son die - killing JH on the spot would remove a threat (JH) and diminish JH's dad power. 

As for the JH and Seri in Switzerland... I am thinking JH is there for good (or at least temporarily long term) to pursue his dream of becoming a pianist.

I am assuming they bought a vacation house and the house becomes their meeting point - frm the photos displayed in the house... it seems like the house has been occupied for quite sometime. So that scene could be months/ yesrs after Seri met JH.
[removed]
Earlier RJH was asked to join the National Sympthony Orchestra as the pianist. Guess that explains his ability to visit Europe and Switzerland specifically for musical events..
1) I think he was referring to their history over all and doing a callback to the convo they had in the field that night on the way to Pyongyang.

2) All he would have is a NK cellphone and you can bet they would be monitoring that sucker given that he had gone to the south and came back under suspicious circumstances. Any provable contact with Se-ri would have been dangerous for her and him. As it was it took approximately 3 years before he could make contact with her again.

3) Sadly, only in the collective imaginings of fans and twitter users...
The "wrong train" refers to the conversation Seri and RJH had in episode 5, when they spent the night outside  the disabled train.  She tells him about an Indian proverb in which a person gets on the wrong train to end up at the right station.  That conversation by the campfire was probably my favorite scene in the whole show.  Seri recognizes RJH's disappointment with life, and tries to comfort him.  It was such a beautiful human scene of two people just talking.  SYJ and HB's chemistry at its apex.
I don’t think RJH literally meant he took a wrong train. As for international calls on mobile devices, 7/10 times devices doesn’t work in other countries.
yeah but given the political climate with NK and SK  that was not put in [RI family plushies](https://i.imgur.com/2AEtj7g.jpg)

I'm not sure what you mean about not holding hands in public.  They held hands in the concert hall.

I agree about the sad ending though. Being together only two weeks a year (in real life it would be more like two weeks every five or 10 years) seems like a form of torture to me.  Not to mention, if RJH is supposedly there as a mentor or chaperone of students, he probably couldn't much of his time with Seri.

RJH's father should have made him a Division 11 agent in China or someplace like that.  Seri and RJH could then have been together.
Ep 16 is about 2 hours long. I think it's not yet finished in Korea
*spoiler* STILL NO SHIRTLESS RJH SCENE?! C'MON!
Should be a LEICA M-P (TYP 240).
Because you will “mostlikelytocry” all over again? Just teasing you. Cute username.
I’m wondering too. It has shown up quite several times but can’t find it in ost
I wouldn't say that it put NK in a positive light. I would say that it humanized it.
I feel that SK always treat with NK respect when they are writer about them. Ah least the one I watched.
[removed]
Her revenge was to punished those responsible for Gu’s death. Basically she got in contact with the NK informant and they sent all the account information to Seri using their China back channel. That was how the second brother and his wife was charged with crimes. The wiretap that Seri had of the brother and wife admitting to plotting her shooting wasn’t legal or count as evidence since it was wiretapping someone without their consent.
I think jong hyuk mentioned something about taking the wrong train and ending up at the place seri was. So it wasn't like he knew that seri was gonna be paragliding at the mountain; he just happened to finally meet her there. I think this was done to once again reinforce the idea of the power of fate in their relationship, how they keep finding each other in the most unlikely situations. I realize that this might still sound very unrealistic but it was written that way to show that their connection is something that transcends physical boundaries (i.e. DMZ) AND also the boundaries of human understanding. Which is why we kept hearing that them meeting and their relationship is not coincidence (something that can be explained by chance) but rather fate (something beyond human power, something that was predestined with no alternate endings possible).

Wow i rambled a lot. Tbh i might just have gone crazy from all the withdrawal symptoms im experiencing rn.
The first we saw of RJH in Switzerland was when he showed up at Seri's paragliding.   So we don't know who got there first.  Probably her.  RJH no doubt went to all the places Seri might be, hoping against hope that she would be there. (Of course in the real world he would call her phone to tell her he was outside NK, but this is not the real world).

And he doesn't live in Switzerland. He only goes there occasionally when either his orchestra or students are there (again in real life, he probably wouldn't be allowed to go there more than once or twice in 10 years, so the whole two weeks every year premise is nonsense).
Well Se-ri was going to Switzerland a bunch to find RJH as evidenced when we see Se-ri aimlessly wandering the streets and returning later to Seoul and her mother who asks "Did you not see him?". Later in the conversation her mother says, "It breaks my heart to see you return in disappointment every time." So we know she's made the journey several times to Switzerland without meeting him. 

To the same effect Seri also talks about posting articles indicating her company has yearly concerts in Switzerland. They then cut to her wandering the streets of Switzerland again. So we don't necessarily know how many times she's gone to Switzerland before they ultimately meet up. 

The conversation she has with the Swiss man at the banquet is the best indicator that indeed they only get two weeks a year with each other: 

Banquet Hall Convo: 

Swiss guy, "Will you stay here for two weeks this time as well?" Seri, "Yes, well, for me this is the most wonderful two weeks of the year." 

My guess is he was on tour with the National Symphony Orchestra when he finally met up with Se-ri in Switzerland the first time; however, he is allowed to return with the NK kids who participate in the competition giving them two weeks every year to be together.
The way I see it, 2 weeks is for tourist visa holders so I am thinking that Switzerland is their place to "unite". 

It seems valid that they do not choose for the 2 to move to Switzerland or at least they did leave the thinking to us, viewers, because realistically Se-ri cannot leave everything she built in SK (I am thinking if they change citizenship, Se-ri has no one else to give her empire to), same way for RJH.

[so much better ](https://imgur.com/a/UxrUL3Q)  Lets imagine they’re baking in Seri’s oven and she is r showing
but why did dan have to suffer such heartbreak :(
What would the correct happy ending be then? And how was the ending rushed LOL. Everyone wanted a happy ending, and they delivered it as realistic as it can get. Episode was **paced beautifully** without wasting any of our time with fluff. I'd like you hear your points though
That was an in-joke of sorts. Kim Soo Hyun returned to a character from a previous work in his career, the 2013 film 'Secretly, Greatly'! That movie tells the story of three North Korean secret agents deployed to South Korea, one of which is played by Kim Soo Hyun as character Bang Dong Goo - disguised as the village idiot. That's why he turns wacky when talking to the boss of the restaurant.
I got the impression that the wife is acutely aware of her husband's shortcomings and chooses to be positive towards him despite that and to be his number one cheerleader. I think she realizes that he's not the most capable lad in town but she does her best to help him play whatever hand of cards his family give him.
Honestly I think that’s the smartest way to operate a big business, own the majority of the shares and let someone else run your company while you are out enjoying life (golfing in Seri’s brothers matter).
I think the eldest brother knew his wife only wanted to stay with Seri at the hospital because Jeong Hyeok was there
I guess he was jealous of Ri Jeong Hyeok!
He probably was jealous of JeongHyeok, and they had that scene because it was a funny twist on the wristgrab cliche (because it was about JeongHyeok instead of the girl being angry and he wants her back). and your comment history is full of you complaining about stupid things. Go deal with real feminist topics.
Fellow late-watcher here (quarantine has given me more time for kdramas...), you are not alone! I was really hoping they’d come up with a reason for him to stay in NK because of her uncle’s power or something. I was ugly-crying throughout the last two episodes.
Just watched it. FML
i mean i finally finished the last 4 episodes today and i am WRECKED someone send an ambulance
Yup. Also that scene in NK when she was crying outside SJ's house and then went to drive after JH in the snow...her acting is so powerful and memorable. I can't think of another actress who has moved me the way she has.
What really got me was when she is in Switzerland and hears the piano and runs towards it thinking its RJH. When she sees that it's someone else her expressions go from elated to hearbroken so quickly. That was a serious piece of acting.
[deleted]
Thanks! He had a very pivotal role. At first, he ratted on people at the expense of innocent lives and his own conscience and morality. Then, he ratted on people for justice, humanity and redemption. This challenging role would have suffered under the hands of a less capable actor, but in his, Man Bok truly shined.
She looked so badass in her last scene with her fashion on point and walking with her instrument. 😍
How about...just Crash Landing On You, but where Seo Dan and Goo Seung are the main characters this time.
Seriously! That character deserved a better finale!
i thought the whole point was that she can be happy and fulfilled without a romantic relationship
DOTS was good but then ending and the part where they were reborned out of anywhere was very irritating, Way too force happy ending. But here it was a much better end be it for the Second or main leads both the stories were managed in a beautiful manner. Even though go seung joon's death hurt but the way Dan handled it and her last scene was so powerful to watch :'). Seri and Jeong hyuk what should I say, they are everything. Even the supporting characters were so so so so good!!!!
It's funny how people who hold DOTS close to their heart also likes CLOY. To me, CLOY definitely beat DOTS as my favorite KDrama since watching it 4 years ago
Lucille the end of this show felt fulfilling enough for me to not be broken up.  Even though it's a bit like losing a friend, I'm happy to have gotten a happy ending. Without that, I'd surely dwell on it for weeks... Or start pushing fur reunification.  I swear sometimes I'll watch dramas and I feel exactly like you -- so emotionally destroyed that I can't even watch anything else. I hope you feel better soon!
...and then the earthquake in Canada...the ending of DOTS was goofy.
That aint too far off from the truth lol
Seri didn’t have friends before NK just employees she was a bit tyrannical with. She really cherished those relationships
And watching her mom watch Dan grieve ... you know she isn’t just crazy over the top.
SAAAAMEEE huhuhu I teared up when they realised Seri's inspiration behind the products. I don't know how the main product line name was translated but 그리움 geu-ri-um means "longing" as far as I know so it did hit me plus the BG started playing and I just can't
The funny part was the NIS chief doing what RJH’s dad did when discovering the nature of their relationship - massaging in between the brows like “crap he loves her”
[THIS was seen around on social media like IG](https://imgur.com/a/ooBjY85) 

And SYJ holding a different chunker baby  in like a nightgown (can’t remember if I have that pic saved or just saw it) 

There were also plushies that looked like the set of Seri’s office that looked like a pink mom, green dad (broccoli?), and 2 mini versions
At that point I dont think there could have been a way for them to be together. If he had been brought back to south korea he would have been used against seri and probably in jail for having stolen the money from the second brother. He would have been alive but still apart from Dan. 

The only ones we can be mad at is the second brother and his wife. Their greed not only cost them their freedom but someone's life.
>and just when we are totally shipping them, he dies.  
>  
>I mean, why????

That's K-drama for you. That's why I don't watch much K-drama as a general rule, because of their habit of sad endings. I was deathly hesitant to start this too, but since Son Yejin is my all time favorite Korean actress, I gave it a shot.
I agree! I was actually glad there was somewhat minimal romantic scenes. I don’t think I was able to get over the their age difference and lack of chemistry. But I loved the show and I really liked the ending too!
I was watching the finale on the train today and I snort laughed when I saw that bit. And the look on his wife's FACE when she was asked about it by the other ahjummas!
My guess is, when we saw him, that was literally the first time he left NK since becoming a musician again. And sure it'd be easy to contact her, once he had the internet, but it's also easy to use the internet track her down especially given his, ahem, non-civilian skills. A bit stalker-ish? Maybe, but let's not dwell on it.
She told her employees that her phone would be turned off.  Kind of a weak explanation, but that is what they used.
My guess is that it's not possible to call from NK.
But he pretty much moved to Pyongyang after he left the military to become the National pianist.
No I don’t think so. I think at the end, they show a Montage of their lives during the time they were  apart, and that reminded me of the show’s intro. Sorry for not being more clear!
I'm more of a handsome-comrade-finally-flashing-a-Coglate-commercial-themed-smile-at-us type of person 😂
When I was watching the episode and saw her genuine smile, I had to pause for a moment. My heart just shattered. I know the difference between genuine and fake smiles, but I was always used to seeing a genuine one first. To see a genuine smile after so many episodes of lesser ones affected me so much.
Dazzling! And life affirming.
Yes! That too. All I was wishing for that scene was for RJH's dad to do the actions. And he did.
In my head he was like was like 

'I warned you not to mess with my son, and still you did. *gun fires. twice*' Yes! 

Perfect. Just perfect to end all the action scenes.
The revenge itself wasn't shown but it was well explained.. 

She talked to GSJ's companion (Cheon) in NK, the scene where she took off her sunglasses. She told him she wanted to seek revenge to everyone involved both in SK and NK, so she used her power and money to send Seri all the evidences of recordings (it was transacted in China)  to spill to details to SK-NIS that it was Sehyung and his wife that initiated the plan.
I was referring to Kwang Beom. Hahaha
Pyo chi su and joo muk both have too much lines and for the 2nd half, Eun dong as well.. 

The only time I remember Kwang Beom to have a lot to say was when he was explaining that he's being scouted in SK (yg, jyp, sm). Then this finale he has some to say too.. That's what I thought
and what a treasure he is, he is!
Me, too! He's a perfect witness of the old Se-ri to the new improved version!
Agreed. This show had to balance on a razor thin political line this whole time, and it did it beautifully.

The thing that stuck out to me the most was the difference between the NIS and the State Security Department. The compassion and professionalism of the NIS officers made me really appreciate living in a country with the rule of law.
Omg that's amazing how you mentioned they didn't let anyone stay in SK because it would be too much a propaganda and it shows that no matter how grim the world looks at NK, some people would choose to go back and stay because it's their home. With that, I can say that the CLOY team really did a great job on the proper representation of NK!! (Even if some would say it's too unrealistic)
I love the term duckling for them😆
We should've seen this coming when Seri told the other NK ladies that her and RJH are like Gyeonwu and Jiknyeo. In hindsight, that was probably as obvious as a foreshadow you can get on their ending really.
I was thinking the exact same thing. Only thing to hold on to 😭
In my fantasy, Seri and RJH decide to live in Switzerland and have a family there. Seri will have someone manage her company in Seoul and she can start another business in Europe. RJH becomes a very successful musician and they will have talented kids who will play all sorts of classical music. The paternal grandfolks will fly in once in a while because the kids wouldn’t be able to go to NK, but they will spend a lot of time visiting their remaining fam in Seoul. Aww, my heart. Hahaha
I think his dad could've worked out a job for him somewhere at a North Korean embassy (Switzerland?) That way he would reside permanently in that country (at least for a couple of years) and Seri could move there to be with him. But that would be both of them setting aside everything else (families, her company, him piano).Though I think they could work it out anyway (him establishing himself as a piano player in that country and Seri flying back and forth to SK every now and then). I don't know I'm still so emotional about this...... I thought I could sleep it off and be okay in the morning but in my plans I somehow disregarded the possibility of being too emotional to fall asleep so I'm still messed up
For sure. Heck it doesn't even have to be plausible realistically. I mean it was already realistically implausible how Se-ri was able to survive in NK that long, let alone even being able to go back to SK under those circumstances. Seeing as this is still considered fantasy, they could've just made up any old BS for it to happen.
It’s not possible to emigrate away from NK and just settle in a new country without severe consequences. That’s considered defection and if you do that the NK government will punish or kill any family you leave behind in NK. So JH’s parents would be in danger. 

Some lucky people can leave NK temporarily for schooling or special jobs, but they always have to go back to NK.

JH would probably defect after his parents die of old age.
South Korea wasn't ready to fight in 1950. Without the US (and the UN) intervening, there would be no South Korea today.  The whole peninsula would be under the North Korean regime.
Yes! When the camera was following him from behind as he made his was to Se-ri.... I was like, how is even the back of his head so attractive?! Hairstyle def helps 😂
Agreed
On the same vein, I’ve always wondered how Dan’s uncle climbed the ranks. 😂
I mean he is a General and Director of the political bureau of one of the most secretive and authoritative regimes in the world. Dude is a cold blooded badass that might have killed alot of people. Don't forget he also had his men ready to kill Seri at night when he abducted her. His actions in the last episode just goes to show the absolute lengths of love that a parent is willing to go to for his or her children
My Xiaomi phone lets me schedule messages, too. Haven't verified the one-year limit tho
Still, PPLs are often very obvious. I think this one actually had impact in the story.
ALL OF THIS... My post was getting too long, so I didn't even breach the subject. However, I referenced how Se Ri evolved from what felt like a cold woman at the beginning of the series ( please make sure to blur my face but show my earrings for the tabloids) to someone whose life changed because of love. Not only RJH but her mother's, and in a way, her father's (given the strong patriarchal society).   
I noticed the more dramas I watch, the more I am interested in well-rounded characters who have no hidden agenda. I am less interested in love triangles, although they are a guilty pleasure and will watch them from time to time, and more into dramas that present real life (or as close as one can get). My Mister and CLOY are perfect examples of this.
Nicely summarized. 👏
Totally agreed. Kdrama has evolved so much.
It’s highly possible. This topic is a very risky one since the beginning, it’s not a fantasy drama where the writer can basically do anything she wants based on her imagination.

I’ve read articles that there’s some legal action going on with the drama because of political things. 

Promoting the idea of love can conquer anything, including trespassing the law between borders, possibly also the idea of defect if you have money, etc etc are all very sensitive.

I think S2 is highly unlikely, but maybe with the popularity of the show we might get a short special ep with this. Vague, but just reassure the audience that it’s indeed a happy end for them.

Or they might just share the pics for that and that’s all. I’m actually convincing myself already that the true ending is they both could settle down for good and have their twins. The ending on ep 16 just didn’t do it for me. Realistic but too sad. 😂
It’s a deleted scene. They originally planned to have the ending with them having a wedding and twins (there are pics of the twins at SR’s apartment in Seoul), but due to some political controversy, they deleted those parts and only aired the current epilogue
*Memories of the Alhambra flashbacks return*
Seo Dan's Mother plays the poor mom and Uncle plays the maid's husband
Me too. I was like... what?!?
Considering the first msg of RJH suggesting to meet at Switzerland was a year after he went back to NK, then it time skips another year to her looking for him at Switzerland, before coming back home to tell her mom about the disappointment again. If we assume the next time she's there is a year later, that's at least 3 years before they finally reunited. In the epilogue, it sounds like the 2 week annual trip is a regular thing. Her employees though assume that this is an LTR with a foreigner, so I'd imagine it would take more than 2 weeks a year trip to come to that conclusion. She's gonna have to visit the Swiss at least multiple times a year for them to suspect there's an LTR going on. So it's safe to say it might be 4-5 years post going back to NK by the time the epilogue comes, which is already plenty of time for whatever narrative surrounding RJH to blow over, and maybe already figured out a more permanent way to remain together. Keep in mind he made the msg to reunite at Switzerland while he was still in SK custody, so he already had a plan in motion since then. I can't imagine these 2 characters, with all their riches, connections, and ingenuity, can't figure out at least to constantly be together in Europe for more than just 2 weeks a year.
Correct, he’s only able to travel outside of NK with the NK music students during that time. That’s what I got from the short and brief interaction.
I’m really glad to hear this. Peace be with you. 😂
Hey, thanks for the link! I checked the description for any more info and was able to type in Park Sang Hee into the description and it didn’t leave me disappointed!

I found the other OST that pulled my heartstrings and it has an MV that really made me shed a tear just seeing the whole orchestra...


https://youtu.be/6u1loc6_2_s

Edit: I also found the singing version which is what I was actually looking for (but I’m still gonna stream the orchestra ver ofc!) but it has a different name called Longing Hill by April 2nd and the female version by Song Ga In💕
Thank you thank you!!!!!
I forgot the exact Korean name for the story but it’s about a couple separated by circumstances. 

The boy is a mortal and the girl is a fairy from heaven, they fell in love but were separated by their different backgrounds. A deity took pity on them and allow them to meet on a magical bridge formed by magpies one day every year. 

This day is the 7th day of the 7th month in the Lunar calendar and it’s kinda known as an Chinese Valentine’s Day. 

I guess in this case Switzerland is the magical bridge?
[This legend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowherd_and_the_Weaver_Girl) that was mentioned on the show.
Will do so!
It’s not here yet. They still have to air it in Korea in about 7 hours from now. They just put it in advance haha
It releases in a little less than five hours from now.
I don’t have a chance to watch it yet and don’t mind spoilers at all.
Agreed, if I clicked into this post before seeing the episode I would expect to see spoilers.
Yeah I know this is a fantasy. And the topic itself is a real political situation between two countries. There’s lawsuit/controversy about the political issues about this drama already about the original ending is supposed to have the scene of their twins (there are leaked pics). That’s why they cut to this slightly vague one instead.

I’m not complaining tbh, bc I myself don’t really see any other possible solution for this as well haha. But it’s just a shame that real politics are involved, otherwise we’d have gotten our most unrealistic but best fantasy-kind of happily ever after for them (at least I prefer that since it’s started as a fantasy already).
I need to sign up for this group too haha
count me in!! hahaha
I had that thought, too. It's also possible that RJH's dad could get taken down someday in a political purge or something. The situation isn't exactly stable.
I think the fact we didn't get an ending we are used to in Kdramas, with room for us (without a season 2) to imagine all the possibilities, is what makes CLOY fantastic.   
I wholeheartedly believe they deserve a happy ending, but relationships look different depending on the people, and it may mean not being together every single waking moment. Some can argue it could be a metaphor for the NK/SK relationship, so close yet so far away.  Whatever the writers meant, I think it was beautifully done.
Great post.  Totally agree!
OOOFF, I hadn't thought about the possibility of an eating disorder, but I can see how her "picky princess- I only eat three bites" hints to it. 

And yes, the character's change is extremely beautiful.
I’m just glad his dad finally grew a pair of balls to use his power to get rid of those trying to manipulate and take his role.
it’s called Sigriswil. it’s available on apple music. im waiting for it to appear on spotify. up until now ive been listening to it as a video recording of the scenes 😅. every single time the song came on i just dissolved into a puddle of tears.
I agree, IU's song is okay but not particularly amazing. It's soothing, but that's how her voice is. It's too much falsetto for my taste
Late to the party, but he said he could only shoot clays in SK and happy that he can shoot real birds in NK.
[deleted]
Yeah I was thinking the same thing too! But then I had the same thought..well it's not soldier RJH. This might be a different side of him we haven't really seen.
Thank you I just watch a preview and it looks great!
Thank you! i didnt even think to look at other k dramas from the same writers - good call
I cantttt😭😭 this set the bar way too high that nothing will be good enough (had the same problem after watching Goblin). The plan is to scour the internet for videos of binjin to make my stupid self believe that they are actually dating irl
so much feels right. It's been a long time I found a show like CLOY. I'm having withdrawal symptoms now.
when was this shown? was it in the drama itself?
His death may be important to advance the storyline- 

1) It motivates Seo Dan to take down Seri's second brother.

2) It ends the Seo Dan/ GSJ arc, where it is difficult to conjure a happy ending.

3) It affords GSJ a sufficiently satisfying closure, where he knows someone mourns for his death.

4) At the same time, his death would preoccupy Seo Dan to the extent where RJH becomes secondary to her, allowing RJH to be with Seri.

In any case, we will know conclusively in about an hour! Can't wait!
The twin babies could have been for the scene with baby Se Ri. It's common to cast twin babies for a baby role
Exactly!
I wish too.. but looking at how kdramas work it doesnt seem like a possibility. Only NETLFLIX can help us.
Yes, yes, yes, healer! ❤❤❤❤ if you feel like you missed a lot of skin in CLOy, healer will give you that. Clean and warm. Their hugs are one of the best hugs in KDrama world. It's just so heartfelt - you'd want to be hugged how healer huggs Park Min Young. And their english OST is also beautiful. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yesss the leads rly got a good chemistry
Scarlet heart ryeo...messed me up but was so good!
I quit watching half way through Bong soon.. she got to be the most clueless superhero.
Thanks! That or healer was next on my list. Since Mr. Sunshine is on Netflix here in Canadia, will check that out first
I quit after the third episode, something about that drama just wasn’t captivating enough.
Haha thanks I'll put that on my list. Ngl Hotel Del Luna made me ugly cry too. My mom thought my girlfriend broke up with me because of my hysterical crying.
That's why I don't understand why people think he just moved to Switzerland as head of the National Symphony Orchestra and Se-ri pops in to visit.
No, she was wearing her ring at the border.  You can see it at 32:13 when she puts her hands to his face.
Can it come out already pleaseeee
Remindme! 20 minutes
Yes sameeee
When I read this, I imagined you in NK!
you're kidding I hope you got it now!
I'm actually crying for you.... It's so good
I’m forgiving of the rings when they finally reunited; and view it as the sponsor (the maker is a sponsor of the show and did Seri’s parents, brothers and wives rings) or production crew oversight. Switzerland was the first filming location they did. The last scenes (or one of them) HB and SYJ shared were the surveillance in the park.
Yes. I had the same thought too. I think the show adjusted its ending after comments from a political party that it was glamorizing NK (which I completely disagree with).
The only thing that will snap me out is watching the second season of kingdom. Hahah. I need zombies because nothing else can compare
Highly doubt there will be a season 2. Unless magically Netflix decides to co-produced it with TvN, if not, it won’t happen.
I’ve been trying to look it up on Spotify and I can’t seem to find it still. Are you also from the US? I’m thinking it hasn’t been released on Spotify over here...unless I’m somehow using the wrong search terms
Sigriswil - Kim Kyoung Hee (it's on Spotify)
This next project sounds quite different and interesting. Thank you for posting the link :-)
Yeah that’s why it’s bittersweet I guess. Dan has always been my favourite and definitely a good role model tbh. I’m just glad GSJ’s death had a purpose and moved the plot i.e. the brother and sister in law’s downfall. I’m also glad to see her mum being supportive (something this show does best!). So although I’m sad GSJ died, I’m glad it wasn’t in vain
Yeah definitely a good ending! Its a best of both worlds kinda thing >!wherein they don’t have to choose between their family or each other. I would’ve been sad if RJH would never see his family or ducklings again and now he can update both ducklings and Seri about each other.!< So I’m still grateful for what we got
That depends which guy?!
Yea, I get you, I just wanted more eps tbh, It would have been good to see more details and the build up to both of those.
Thank you so much!
RIGHT??? I yelled because the guy didn't even CPR lmao
Yeah hoping it’s the former otherwise they would have a lot to tie up in the 1+ hour! (Also hoping the uncle doesn’t turn out to be a baddie like what some here have hypothesized)
I think he was just overwhelmed with emotions at that point of time and thrown off by Cho’s last words about the threat to his parents and YSR
A North Korean defector was an expert helping to write the drama. So I believe the argumentation in this particular scene. He felt he hit the wall. No escape from the most impossible of situations. He stays - his family gets punished. He goes - they get punished anyway. He loves his family too much to let them suffer like this - they already went through a huge loss once. Seri would probably get punished for harbouring North Korean individuals but it wouldn't be the capital punishment his parents would receive.
No idea. Saw it on Twitter. Thought it was harmless because the music was so gorgeous than noticed i had not seen those scenes before.
Yeah, sorry, I meant to say Australia. CLOY finale finishes when the BTS tracklist drops, so I guess I won't be sleeping tonight! Thank you!
The street kids and the young Se-ri :)
It's 1 hour and 50 minutes long and it's already on Netflix.
His ending was beautiful. I’m really happy he didn’t die as so many expected.
I always like Manbok because he's still competent even when crossing to SK. Him recording Se Ri's room led to her reconciling with her mom and (partially for) the second brother's downfall.

So happy he got a more fulfilling and less dangerous job.

I'm also happy the former insurance agent got triple his former salary. That man deserved it.
oh, I see. Tbh I wanted to more of her in this role, living her life and all.
I' think you're generally right, but RJH was definitely looking around for someone on the mountain tram and in other Swiss scenes.  I think that had to be Seri.
Haha, thanks! It's been a bit of a challenge over the last week especially, because I finished watching a bunch of things and now I'm on a total slump. I can't get into anything at all, so the wait for the CLOY episodes have been felt that little bit extra.

Until recently, I was watching both episodes together on Sunday evenings, but this weekend I'm watching them as soon as I can each morning. The anticipation is real!!!
Yeah they just sort of sat there in the ambulance. With the defibrillator I'm pretty sure it didn't even touch her skin 😅
Yeah its probably due to that.. so 30 more mins haha
Its up now!!
Honestly I loved this show but this somewhat ruins it for me. I think they could have found a way to have them be together, with it making sense still
It's now on spotify. You can look for the official OST there :)

You're not the only one😭.I bawled my eyes out and did the ugly wailing and sobbing, it was exhausting. I wished for an ending so good that would make me feel better after all that crying...and that's not what I got.
Do you know what the caption is saying?? Is there any translation?
You're probably right.
Yeah, I am of the opinion that the villain outstayed his welcome by several episodes.
No I don’t think here’s there long term. Otherwise Seri would’ve handed the company to a manager and moved there with him. The photos look like they meet there once a year.
Hahahaha I know! Seri is living the dream
I choose to believe his parents arranged that for him. Dan’s mom made JH’s mom think about the love JH walked away from to return to NK and keep his parents safe. He could’ve defected to the south.
SR’s number would’ve worked in most part of the continent. And RJH could’ve drop her a message or call once he’s out of NK, using a non NK phone. Given his military background, he must have memorized her number with ease. 
I kept thinking why didn’t he do that? It will make both their lives easier without all the finding each other by fate.
They were holding hands under the table. I read somewhere that they were hiding it. 

It was nice seeing them together, but I didn’t like the fact that they didn’t have a life together abroad. The Division 11 plot that you proposed seems better. 

It was sad and I agree with you. :(
it’ll probably finish in about 40 minutes! then another hour before it comes on Netflix with subs? i’m not sure :)
Found it! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M0SUTehO1tw
I agree. But isn't humanizing it also putting it in a positive light?

Edit: given that they are always portrayed as bad guys and villain (not saying that all NK characters here are good) but they made NK characters that will be loved by the people.
Which one?
Swiss city scenes: Zürich

Snowy place JH and Dan visited: Jungfraujoch

Paragliding scene: First, near Berggasthaus

Concert scene: Victoria Jungfrau

JHSR’s loveshack: Lungern, specifically the house at the end of Mühlefluh street

Also how did I know? I was in almost all the exact same places but was 2 months too early to catch them filming the show there 😭
Haha all good. I hear what you’re saying and I understand their encounters are based much around fate. Personally, it’s just too unrealistic for my taste and the ending wasn’t for me.
There is no indication that moving forward in the future, two weeks a year is all the couple is going to get. That second time Seri reunited with RJH in Switzerland was during a time she managed to get a two week “do not disturb” vacation and “the most wonderful two weeks of the year” (to quote your line from the episode). 

It does not necessarily indicate they only have two weeks per year together from then on. It just meant that during their second reunion for that year which is also their first *planned* two week reunion since first meeting in Switzerland again after paragliding, it will be Seri’s most wonderful two weeks of *that* year.
I totally agree, I had to pause and yell "what rhe fuck" when THAT happened. Most intense part of the episode + the standoff gun scenes.
Agree. Beautifully paced. My heart still (dont know how to explain it huhu) but im happy and okay with it. I felt like the writer did her best for the audience to part well with the show. Though I like for the ducklings to stay in SK, its not possible. And honestly, I'm thankful that the ending was like that - no matter how bittersweet it was. I'm okay with it and thankful for the ending. I will believe in their love for each other (is what I feel like the writer wants to share) even for SD and GSJ. Just love and nothing more. But I will still root for SD. And why did GSJ die? His shot was in the heart. Huhu. Hayyy. 

I'm just thankful. Thank you, CLOY team for such a show.
Hmm, personal feels. I love and live for the acting but something about they wrap the ending up was shallow? It was nice, yeah, but not like "YES!YESSS! YESSSS!!!" more like "Oh, yeah, cool."  Realistic? Not really because it felt like our MC going Switzerland, was it forever? or just 2 weeks every year?
Same here. I literally just finished the last episode. 

Man, this was such a roller coaster of emotions, especially towards the end. I'm so glad I decided to give this a go, though. Everyone worked so well off of each other. 

I also can't believe how happy I am for Seo Dan. I disliked her initially but she grew on me. The relationship between her and her mother was also lovely. Honestly, almost all the relationships (not Se Hyung and his wife lol) portrayed in the drama were beautifully written and acted.

And I miss the ducklings and Man Bok so much. Can we please have a spin-off just focused on their lives?  

There's so much I feel and want to say about the drama but I don't know how to put everything into words so I will just settle on thanking the cast and crew for this lovely drama.
That shit hurted 🤪
They both deserve a Baeksang for that scene alone!
I don't know why but I was expecting SG to appear from the side of the trees and smile at her. I don't know why....but I was expecting him to come back so many times. I didn't want him to go! ;(
Her outfit in the last scene was an amazing look. I want it all ID-ed.
Something like Con-man hitting on you? :)
They translated it as ‘Saudade’ which I thought was really fitting :)
설마... Maybe they reserved an extended epilogue or short to show their married life post main drama if the show achieves some sort of record breaking rating? Like a special fan service? Pleasssseee
Thank you!! Would love to see that plushie-on-set post if you have a picture or something.
I feel like it would have been easier than RJH/Seri since he was already on the run hiding in NK and Dan was wealthy. I was really hoping they had pretended he died and he really went “far away” like Dan was telling RJH but when it turned out he was for sure dead, I got soooo sad. Loved his character
from Switzerland
Ah I see :D It's ok! Had to rewatch the intro to check, but any excuse for a rewatch is good haha!
Yes! He doesn't need to say a word to catch our attention. His character is the perfect balance to the riot and craziness of the other ducklings.
>  The compassion and professionalism of the NIS officers

I think this is the first kdrama I've watched where the government agency was actually likable
Seriously I've never liked the NIS so much, especially after all those political dramas like Designated Survivor or Chief of Staff. They were really likable and so funny (jeonghyuk's security footage, analyzing love, and the NK5 purchases).
The actual NIS is pretty terrible and oversteps its legal boundaries all the time, mind.
Well CLOY has critics who claimed the show romanticized the north.  There are actually NK defectors who had watched the show and made commentary on YT (what I had seen was pretty positive or described for the most part accurate) There was A North Korean on production helped HB with his accent and the show but HB already played a NK in a movie).
This is officially the ending for me, no one can tell me otherwise. I'll fight them if they do.
That kinda sucks as Seri wouldn't have the opportunity to care and interact with RJH's parents.
Hahahaha I know right!!!! That was why so many of us were suspicious of him during the CCK court scene because it looked like the show was hinting at a darker persona hidden underneath that jolly exterior!!
My take is they're releasing the pics as an "epilogue" on its own. There's a picture of a baby in seri's apartment too. So now i have no idea if they really had another ending in mind.
Do you have links to articles on legal action related to the show?
my goodness. if you didn't mention, i wouldn't even know o m g
Sorry I might have missed it but when did they mention the legend? (This probably means I should binge the entire drama again, surely that would be the only responsible thing to do.)
Please do. The withdrawal is real and the questions, comments still remain.
But they posted that it's here now
Apologies, I was going by my local time as it  was 2am when I commented
> the original ending is supposed to have the scene of their twins (there are leaked pics).

All the leaked pics I've seen are of a baby that's supposed to be baby Seri, or the baby from a crew member dressed in a tomato costume, and not the twins. Unless I'm looking at the wrong ones. And if there is such an ending, was it filmed already, and just cut?
I totally get what they did here. Honestly I’d be fine with this ending if it’s for any other drama. It’s indeed, as you say beautiful and bittersweet. But CLOY is just that special drama for me unlike any others that’s why I still feel heartbroken despite we get a ‘happy ending’.

I don’t think there’s gonna be S2 to be honest. Everything basically is wrapped up, but a special ep or something is possible
This song has been my favorite. I’m so in love with it and the lyrics hit me right in the feels. I couldn’t wait until is became available on free streaming apps that I had to buy it from Apple. Amazing song. ❤️
Completely agree
I think their last scenes were the NIS park surveillance of their body language; and then the kdrama to end all scenes when they are at the border and Seri shows up
Same hahah. Well they did wear identical coats to the wrap party! I hope they are holding hands under the table and a few yrs from now we hear an announcement. Oh by the way they got married 5 years ago, and SYJ has been MIA for a couple years because they have a 2 year old. But she is seeking her next award winning role lol
Yes. I cant explain it. But I'm really happy with the ending. Like I ended reading a book with satisfaction. I do not need to let my imagination run wild and that's mentally satisfying, hehe if you know what I mean. Like I can move on knowing that was the case but my heart is still full. Ughhhhhhh words cant explain lol but yes too much feels. 

I feel like crying as I let go of the show.
No it’s photoshop. Somebody took the pics from the photo shoot  they did to promote the show ... and the [actors who played Seri’s father and the NIS chief holding a baby / twins on social media veins the scenes](https://imgur.com/a/ooBjY85)
No, it's a fan made photo.
It's coming out in an hour?
OMGG Park Min Young and Ji Chang Wook were so believable as a couple! Their skinship was so natural and the progression of their relationship was organic. You can tell that their characters were drawn to each other
Any idea what’s the English OST?
Throughout the first and maybe second episode you may feel a little confused because there’s so much action (I was a bit but the cinematography and compelling actors kept me in). But they’re like background stories or histories that are interwoven into our  our characters. Everything will make sense when things go into the bigger picture. It’s a great drama

Hahaha I was thinking it was the perfect way to end off the series (maybe not the most convenient)

My situation is actually very similar lol. 
(I’m from South Africa and load shedding (power cuts) are a common thing here) so seeing it happen in the series was quite funny and unfortunately very relatable)
No :( 
But it’s ok... I’ve decided to use the last of my phone battery on it!!
I’m just going to watch it on my phone!
Wouldn't the hero defecting be the opposite of glamorizing life in NK?
What were the comments and by who?
I'm watching "Tell me what you saw" really good as well
Hey, can you send me a link, when I manually search it, I don’t get any results :/
Looking forward to it! Like both actors so much.
The ambulance guy that didn't do shit when my smol baby died :(
I think being a high level official in a government headed by a mad man might mean that you shouldn't put your head up too often lest it be chopped off. Dad may have wanted to minimize talk of his son's death in case it brought a lot of scrutiny onto him and the rest of his family.
No worries, I've been staying up the last few weekends waiting for the new episodes because who needs sleep :)
Thanks!
Yeah, that fortune teller conned us. Lol.
Yep, I think my comment applies to before he first saw her at the bridge, and yours applies to after.
>so the wait for the CLOY episodes have been felt that little bit extra.

Oml tell me about it!! My friends and I talk about the episode all night trying to predict what happens next  (we don’t watch the preview scene at the end for the suspense) and it really got worse tonight cos we’re getting more impatient now that it’s about to end. I’m still pretty bummed. I really love the writer cos she’s done so many romantic comedies I’ve grown to love. Idk what I’ll do without this drama for a while. I typically watch 2 on air dramas but nothing caught my eye this time around. I might try to watch some shows that are already complete bc I can’t even watch any newer, unfinished dramas that can live up to CLOY. GOOD LUCK TO US 😂😂😂
Argh.
How? Se-Ri wouldn't live in NK. If Jeong-Hyeok stay in SK he would be considered a traitor and his parents would be executed. This is the best closure without making the characters choose each other over their parents and country. It's realistic.
Is there a link? I don't see it on the ost list on spotify
*You can’t handle the truth.*
"all four seasons and twelve months of time with you and breathe, I'll be with you everyday" it's the lyrics to one of their OSTs (by IU I think)
It would have been too easy and wouldn’t create any anticipation. 😁
They were sitting kind of awkwardly (I don't know why he didn't move his chair closer to her) but the people behind them in the audience could clearly see them holding hands.  I think that is the way most people hold hands when sitting at a table, not up on the table itself.
Yes, that's true! As an American it was very interesting for me to watch how NK was portrayed in this. We only see them as bad guys, impoverished or imprisoned, or refugees.
On top of my head right now there is The King 2 Heart, descendants of the sun, The movie Secretly Greatly,  a little on Doctor Stranger. There is more, I Just need to remember. But I said treat with respect it is to humanize its citizens, not to validate the regime.
[removed]
I can respect that!
I'm not sure what a "YES!YESSS! YESSSS!!!" ending would be, i'm curious exactly how you would've liked it to end. >!They spent half the episode with the timed messages which was eventually led up to them meeting so I don't think the pacing is bad. And I think it's a 2 week thing every year (for now), nothing else says otherwise. !<
Yeah, exactly! When Dan entered the scene, I rolled my eyes thinking she would just be another spurned ex, but she was so much more.

I also loved how almost everyone had character development! 

A spin-off would be amazing. I thought I recovered but then I started listening to the soundtrack and couldn’t. It’s definitely a drama I will rewatch someday!
I also discreetly wished for him to surprise everyone that He is actually alive - especially surprising Seo Dan. But I think that Seo Dan’s character actually manifests women’s strength - that women do not need a man to be happy. For Seo Dan, she already found her happiness (although he did not live) - he will live in Seo Dan’s heart forever. For Seo Dan, she has already found her true love. Her character is very powerful for someone who was born and raised in a conventional and conformist place.
Ikr i was was holding on to that till the end credits sadly it didn't happen :(
Plot twist: It take place in an alternate universe where Goo Seung survives but Se Ri dies instead. 😭
[here you are!  I thought they were going to market it with the plushie from her birthday. ughh](https://imgur.com/a/Slm9Vv6)
Oh, right!
This is series is definitely a utopia haha
Hahah you’ll like them more because Hyun Bin will play a NIS agent in his new movie that opens by the end of the year. It’s about the Korean hostage crisis in 07 when the Taliban took missionaries
even in Vagabond the only likeable NIS agents were Go Haeri (Suzy) and Gang Joo-Cheol, and Gi Tae Woong (Shin Sung Rok) once it was certain he was on the good guys' side.
I don't care much about the romantization (sure there are issues of proper portrayal but come on even the entire kdrama industry romanticize SK a lot). I think NK deserves this romantization as well because at least it will make viewers think twice about the generalization of NK as poor, puppets, refugees, etc. and there is life in NK that most media take away from it just because their society don't adhere to our definition of progress. I acknowledge the absurdity of their government and the suffering of its people and CLOY showed it as well so I think the show balanced the good and tge bad properly. The most important thing is it left a better representation of NK.
I read in an article somewhere that there's a couple of humanitarian and political groups who want to file a complaint against the people behind the drama because they see them as NK sympathisers. Oh what would it be like once this drama is smuggled into NK, the impact it'll make beyond entertainment. It was a privilege to see such work in my lifetime.
Yep. That’s what makes their relationship so impossible and sad. Even their “happy” ending comes with lots of limitations. But let’s imagine his parents died of old age soon after the epilogue so he was able to defect to SK and marry Seri.
Wait what, where did you see the baby pic? I haven’t seen it and I need to haha.
And I think this might be part of an extended epilogue actually, hope they’ll release it
The legend was mentioned when the ajummas had a drinking party with Seri while JH drove Dan back to Pyongyang. 

Seri tried to tell the ajummas she has a forbidden love with JH. She first brought up Romeo and Juliet. The ajummas were like “who?”. Then she mentioned this legend. And they all went “Ah! Now we understand.”
I agree. I am going to binge it again for clarity
OP didn’t necessarily mean to say that the episode is *HERE* but she meant that “today’s the *day*”. Ig u can say it’s a figure of speech. The post itself says that it airs at 9pm KST and the show lasts for an hour and a half and I bet u wait a bit longer for the subs so if you calculate it and convert it to your time, then that would be when the show’s available
There are some pics of baby twin girls at SR’ Seoul apartment but those are hard to find, guess it’s been kept from leaking further. And also the actor who played SR’s dad and the NHS guy holding the same twins (this you can find I think).
i literally paid for apple music a few hours ago and have been listening to it on repeat
Lolol nice to meet a fellow delusional fan😂😭
Ahh I see, thanks for letting me know. The twins are so cuuuute though!!
Yea, on Netflix!
Yes, totally!!! The best ever. Especially the kitchen scene. ❤ like so natural.
Michale learns to rock- eternal love..
I see! I hope you managed to watch the finale on your phone.
It's worth it! The episode is lovely.
I'm under the impression that, since some SK shows illegally make it to NK, they wouldn't want to give the people up north ideas.
Ikr!!! For someone who's been working in medicine ward for way too long i felt offended and frustrated...
True. And if he's as noble as his two sons and seeks justice for his son's death, he would end up in this rabbit hole of discovering this spider web of corruption and more enemies which is ultimately to the detriment of his family. Given his age and capacity, he could only use his power to protect his loved ones, those who are remaining alive.
Apparently only HB got flowers...hahaha
Hi. Here is the [spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/46paHZ8Md6AICwfjybLjOM?si=_1bhUnfLTIKXgJ9AuT4lUg)
Thank you! Feeling empty right now. Any news or bts im ready to watch and read!
Oh I guess it wasnt the only one that humanize NK. But it's just that CLOY is somewhat new and focused a lot on NK since it made things work in the current timeline and society as well as situated almost the entire drama in NK showing how the society could be like aside from the characters.

(Also never validate the regime or any regime in the first place coz whether it's a capitalist or communist society, the leaders suck)
Heh I was lucky enough to be able to travel there with my family, shall count my blessings 😌

Hope you get to go there someday in the near future!
I think what most people were hoping was that he be inSwitzerland on a more permanent basis where he and Se-ri could have their life together there - not for just two weeks of every year. 2 weeks is bittersweet.
Man, my own comment is getting downvoted for my opinion lol.... I would had liked it to have one more episode to settle everything regarding the brother of Seri, some sort of closure between both the parents of our MCs? I think it's kind of a bittersweet thing, u do u. I honestly just didn't had the "feel", different people, different reactions. Have a good day!
They never actually said he died... There was that ambulance scene where he flatlined but they never used those words as far as I recall. And Seo Dan simply said he'd gone far away. 

(I mean, I'm pretty sure he died, but jeez, a girl can hope).
Yes and also he restored / reinforced her confidence. She grew up lacking confidence and was just following RJH much of her life. GSJ gift is the sacrifice he made for her to live so she can continue being her strong, steely self
I would've preferred that tbh I was bored with the main couple after a while. I just wanted seo dan and gsj to be happy. BUT NO let's kill him off for no reason
Hi, here it is: [baby in seri's apartment](https://twitter.com/bingingonbinjin/status/1229220787632005121?s=21)

They even released promotional materials including merchandise of [twin stuff toys.](https://twitter.com/whereisluna1/status/1229062134711177217?s=21)

This has made me curious and skeptical if the ending was what they originally intended.
Oh okay! I remember that but I only know the story from Chinese folktales so I didn’t pick up on the Korean names. Thank you!
I thought of the myth after watching the episode last night, forgetting that it had been mentioned previously (still not sure where)! But that’s one of the big reasons why I actually like the ending — I like how it’s a modern-day homage to such a classic love story.
They literally said "well folks it's here". That's not a figure of speech for today's the day.
You got a link kind sir/ma'am? :)
That’s wonderful. Enjoy the song
It’s either twins or the same child lol
Thank you!
I did! And it was great!
Wow... it really was
OOO, a NK edit vs SK edit...I would watch that ;)
I'm sure North Koreans already know the various considerations when it comes to defection.  I doubt the producers of CLOY were concerned about promoting defections when 99% of North Koreans will never see the show.
Thank you for your service!! Very much appreciated
The difference with CLOY is that they spent a lot of time at NK than another other drama. I agreed with you.
Bad brother is in jail, good brother is doing well with Seri. Seri's parents are happy she's alive and well in SK. RJH's parents are happy that he's alive and well. Maybe you're saying to resolve some tension between the RJH's mother and father? but one more episode to explain that would be a definite overkill. As viewers, I think we can rest easy knowing that the family's are reunited and happy.

For the record I didn't downvote you. I can try to see other perspectives, but I when you claim that the ending was "extremely unrealistic" and was "waaaay too rushed" (more objective POV's) without any real substance, as opposed to just saying that you didn't have the feel (Subjective), I can't just let that go without a proper explanation lol
[deleted]
Ah thank you so much!! Someone said that there are parts that they didn’t air, the baby part might be the extension of the epilogue we got.

The scenes in Switz were filmed first so to actually change the ending might be difficult. Maybe they just chose not to air the part with the baby (or they’ll release later I hope so)
😪
I didn’t have the one with the twins in SR’s apartment. It used to be on twitter I believe. But the 2nd I have it saved on my phone, if you’d like I can email you lol
There's hardly anything to thank... Its my job its literally the only thing i know i can do well. Also why is everyone upset about no twins 😒
Sure, glad to explain it to u.
Ah. Well there goes my faint hope ...
Yup. I was also holding onto hope until this very same part :(
If we're lucky, TvN might release a special episode or add some extra scenes in the DVD
Can you PM? lol

I thought the pic of the baby in the apartment was the baby Seri one. Or is there a pic with 2 babies at the apartment?
I'm sure you can do a lot of other things well! :) And we need twins for .. science. And we thirsty ppl
Thats one way to look at it 😂
