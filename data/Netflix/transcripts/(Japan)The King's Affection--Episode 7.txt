PREVIOUSLY…


Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?


Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un of the Crown Prince


is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?


-No.
-Your Royal Highness!


Why do you have this book?


That girl must have been someone
quite special to you.


-She was my first love.
-You have a big problem!


The Minister of Personnel
lodged an appeal for your resignation.


For my resignation?
I'm in need of your help.


You are the only person
who can help me now.


There is nothing I can do for you.


So I advise you to stop asking.


You could have punished just me
from the beginning.


Why are you torturing my innocent friends
and putting everyone in danger?


Moreover, he deceived
me and the Crown Prince.


The degree of his crime is quite severe.


Who is going to get killed?


I order you as the Crown Prince.
Hand over the prisoners.


If you do, no one will shed
a drop of blood here tonight.






Allow me…


to answer that question.


I was the one…


who moved the prisoners.


I was taught that prisons are where
prisoners receive punishment,


not where they are meant to die.


Despite that objective of His Majesty's,


their living conditions
have become horrendous


and have led to prisoners starving
or freezing to death.


It is why I seek forgiveness
regarding the unsanctioned transfer


of said prisoners.


You dare interrupt today's ruling


to notify me of this frivolous matter?


Your Majesty, I have urgent information


regarding the incidents at Samgaebang.


This is not a matter His Royal Highness
should involve himself in.


I'll allow it.


Speak.


Royal Tutor Jung never disobeyed
the custom of our class system.


Those who actually did…


are them.


Enter.


One is a herb gatherer


who supplied pharmacies within the capital


and one is the custodian
of Literary Licentiate Choi's storage.


Repeat to His Majesty what you told me.


The accusation that
the physician of Samgaebang


only prescribed pricey medicine
is a false one.


Literary Licentiate Choi over here
bought all the medicinal herbs


available from villages


and stocked them in the storage he owns.


Regardless of age,
people started dying left and right


due to a lack of medicine.


After learning the truth, Physician Jung
found herbs that provide similar remedies


and made them affordable.


It resulted in the price drop
of the herbs in storage


which prompted this accusation.


Is this all true?


Of course not, Chief State Councilor!
I'm being falsely accused.


No, we speak the truth!


I have a ledger that lists
all transactions of the herbs.


MEDICINAL HERB INVENTORY LEDGER


Unlike the rumors surrounding Samgaebang,


you are saying it was a place
that helped the unfortunate.


It never indulged in foul play either.


Yes, but I guess


that depends on what you view
as following the rules and being dutiful.


All I want to say is that it's a place
that didn't go against the justice


I wish to promote in this nation.


And Royal Tutor Jung shares
the very same values.


I also believe His Royal Highness' claims
to be true, Your Majesty.


But you were the one


who first raised questions
regarding this matter!


Please forgive me for acting rashly


without taking a deeper look
into the underlying truth, Your Majesty.


I hear you.
However, that was not the only issue.


Jung Ji-un became a royal tutor


without disclosing his prior operations.


If I dare say so, Royal Tutor Jung
never lied about his past endeavors.


I accepted his teaching
while aware of his past,


and I'm sure you remember
that I informed you of this matter.


But you chose not to listen to me.


In the end,


you were the one who moved forward
with appointing him as my tutor.


So if anyone's to blame,


it would be Your Majesty
and the high officials of the court


who did not properly conduct
a background check.


So us being negligent is to blame?


Do not forget.


The path I choose


will be your path.


And if you deviate from that path,


I will not forgive you,


no matter how much I adore you.


I wish to take


that path with you.


Aren't you curious


as to in what way…


I wish to follow your lead?


Is the Crown Prince ready
to fight his battle?


EPISODE 7


Thank you so much.


Your gratitude should be extended
to His Royal Highness, not me.


Your Royal Highness,


no words can possibly convey my gratitude.


There is no need to thank me.


I just could not sit idly by


when I knew the truth.


If you head to Seorin-bang,


you'll be able to reunite
with your assistants.


I had no idea you'd take action
in solving this issue.


Well…


He's your friend, isn't he?


And he's also…


my tutor.


JEONOKSEO


-Ji-un.
-Ji-un!


Ji-un.


You obtained the Crown Prince's trust
in a short amount of time.


I'd expect no less
from someone as prodigious as you.


If you ever harm them again--


I won't force you…


to find a place within the royal court.


But don't you dare think about
being a hack of a physician again.


For your sake
and your mother's especially.


Just remember that it isn't easy
to cope with your one and only son


being chewed out.


My lady!


My lady, the night is deep.


-My lady, where are you headed?
-Stop this. I can't take it anymore.


-My lady, it's dangerous.
-Let go!


-My lady.
-I won't let this slide.


-But it's dangerous.
-What could be so dangerous?


-Let go of me!
-My lady!


Let go.


-Those blabbermouths--
-I knew it.


I was wondering whose voice was so loud.


Ji-un!


Gosh. Are you all right? Are you?


Of course I am.


My lady, your shoes don't match.


You can give me those
and go about your business.


Did the ladies in Bukchon
speak ill of me again?


No, that's not it.


They once loved to pass around
the medicine you prescribed,


but now they're saying ridiculous things.


They're obviously jealous
that you became a royal tutor,


so how can I let them carry on?


That's feisty coming from
the inspector's better half.


From what I hear, you used to be
the most timid maiden in the village.


My one and only son made me
a salty woman, that's why.


Until when will you find shelter
elsewhere from home?


It's time you moved back in.


Your father is gravely worried about you.


I'm sorry.


Goodness, I repeated the same thing again.


Just come by whenever you want to.
Like today.


Your room is still as it was.


Success doesn't mean
finding work at the palace.


Doing what you love and being happy
is the definition of a successful life.


So don't let others intimidate you


and live your life as you wish.


Don't let others dictate your life.
Do you hear me?


What…


Weren't you going to leave the palace


once you saved your assistants?


How could I possibly leave
when you went through so much


to clear my name?


I decided to stay where my heart lies
for a while longer.


Your heart?


I seem to have had
the wrong idea about you.


I let your nicknames
Five Step Prince and Ice Prince


cloud my judgment


and assumed that
you were audacious and cold-hearted.


However, that wasn't the case.


Your generosity knows no limit,
Your Royal Highness.


You could have easily been written about
in this Confucian classic.


A cold-hearted soul


who doesn't bat an eye
even at the sight of death?


No, that was only a preposterous rumor.


I'm living proof of it, don't you agree?


That being said,


why was His Royal Highness
given the nickname Ice Prince?


Because his heart
is icy cold all year round--


Ice is clear and sparkles under the sun.


It is more elegant than any other jewel.


And that is the origin


behind his nickname the Ice Prince!


Why does it feel like there's a chance
of him getting a promotion before me?


Your Royal Highness.


Your Royal Highness.


We have fine weather today.


Isn't it nice to enjoy
a lecture outside for a change?


You should watch where you're going.


Walking backward will surely
make you trip and fall into a pond.


I'm more sturdy and nimble
than people think


which is why I have never tripped before--


Goodness!


Your Royal Highness.


How cool.


Wait for me, Your Royal Highness!


THE WATER IS COLD AND THE NIGHT IS CHILLY


WITH WIND…


What have you been
taking your time writing?


WELCOME RAIN ON A SPRING NIGHT


A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT


"A good rain knows its seasons right."


I don't think
I properly expressed my gratitude


for the help I received.


Like the good rain
that falls when most needed,


I will be someone who you can count on.


Just like you were to me
when I needed you the most.


Goodness.


It's raining, Your Royal Highness.


Perfect timing, don't you think?


A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT


Your Royal Highness, it's Bok-dong.


What is this about?


Oh, Court Lady Kim ordered me
to check if you're set for the night.


I see.


-By the way, Bok-dong.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.


It's about Royal Tutor Jung.


Has he been getting along
with those at the royal institute?


You have no idea. Life at the palace
must be like second nature to him now


considering how he brings them alcohol
and gladly trades shifts.


He is as amiable as they get
and is highly praised by the rest.


You can tell


that he's nothing like his father
from the way he acts toward you.


Why do you ask about him though?


What? No reason.


If you're done, dismiss yourself already.


Yes, Your Royal Highness.
I wish you a good night.


A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT


Since His Majesty is in poor health,


it might not be a bad idea
for the Crown Prince


to greet the envoys.


I'm well aware of your desire
to give more authority


to His Royal Highness.


Then I'll trust that


you will make a formal request
to His Majesty.


But I hope you don't think
that I will blindly act


according to your desires.


It's what I noticed with the incident
involving the royal tutor,


but lately,


I haven't been pleased about you


overstepping your authority.


Overstepping my authority?


I…


vowed my allegiance to the former king


with blood on my lips.


How could you possibly say such a thing


when I put my life on the line
to help him take the throne?


I understand your fondness
for the Crown Prince,


but His Majesty is also
someone you must serve.


If you offend him in any way,
you will answer to me.


Your Highness, then wouldn't it
only be fair that you lead by example?


What?


More and more key officials
are being appointed in your favor.


You should never forget


that it is I who have been
considerate of your desire


to give your family power.


You dare threaten me?


Of course not, Your Highness.


All I want


is for those after
His Royal Highness' crown


to no longer be a threat.


That is all.


Therefore…


I suggest we refrain from
pointless squabbles, Your Highness.


A foot disorder?


-Has Father's foot disease returned?
-Yes.


His Majesty has been overwhelmed
with state affairs


and his prognosis isn't good.


Aside from Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong,


he's the first to protect you
from close proximity.


Hasn't it been uncomfortable?


I should learn to get used to it.


I cannot forever be served
by only Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong.


Right.


Your Majesty.


Leave the herbal tonic.


Father.


It is I.


I see. What brings you by?


I would like to make a request.


Please let me be
in charge of receiving the envoys.


Aren't you aware of
that being Prince Jaeun's responsibility?


Actually, I was hoping


to greet them in your place
when they arrive at the palace.


I'm aware that the same request
came from the Queen Dowager as well.


And who says that is what I want?


I will greet the envoys
according to custom.


You are dismissed.


Father,


do you still not have faith in me?


I am well aware that you were against
my installation as Crown Prince.


Was it…


because of my maternal grandfather?


Or…


was it…


because of Gyeom?


What is your reason…


for bringing that up after all this time?


I understand that
you find my grandfather to be difficult.


But this is what I want for myself.


I ask you


to put your faith in me this time.


I…


won't let you down.


He sure is adorable.


There is something
quite adorable about him.


How are preparations coming along
at the guesthouses for the envoys?


Have you heard from the governor who went
to Uiju to accompany the envoys?


You should pace yourself and take it easy.


I am taking His Majesty's place.


There can be no room for error.


Let your mind rest for now.
We have to be at the market soon.


I will first retrieve
the report sent by the governor.


Your Royal Highness.


I hear lectures have been canceled
to focus on greeting the envoys.


Yes, I'm afraid I won't be able
to attend for the time being.


I see.


Since you're busy, I'll keep it short.


Not even the legendary physician Hua Tuo
has seen these pills


which were made
with a drop of dragon tears--


Do you have nothing to do?
Why don't I ask Royal Scholar Yang to--


Hardly. I actually have
urgent business to address.


Take some when you are having
a difficult time.


It will give you courage
and relieve you of anxiety.


Then…


Oh, right.


Was it Royal Tutor Jung who just came by?


No one can match his anti-climactic ways.


They are all of good quality.


As if.


Let me take a look
since I know a thing or two.


I'll take this one.


Have them delivered to Samgaebang.


This one right here.


And this as well as this.


-You know what? Just send them all.
-Yes, my lady.


They are all to be sent to Samgaebang?


Like I said, I owe them that much.


What on earth?


You must be the type
to apologize with gifts rather than words.


Oh, well…


Wait, is that wrong?


I'm apologizing for my wrongdoing
by buying them what they need the most.


I only do so because I can afford it.


I'm just saying.


Anyway, why are you carrying around
that hand plow?


Oh, this? I'm looking
for some flowers to plant.


I can't afford to buy them
like someone I know,


so I must acquire them myself.


Wait.


Forgive me.


For putting you in a predicament, I mean.


I wanted to apologize in person,


but I couldn't muster up the courage.


Why are you laughing?


Well, because I was only joking.


Besides, you shouldn't apologize.


It's not like you told lies
just to get me into trouble.


Never did I think


you'd be a fun person to tease.


Let's see.


Why do you wish to plant flowers
within the palace grounds though?


Well, they're pretty. That's why.


We should hang up more square lanterns
to light up the streets more.


-Will do, Your Royal Highness.
-Good.


And the decorations?


They should also be prepared accordingly.


What's the matter?


Oh.


It's nothing.


Do you know them?


Yes, he is--


I mean, they are colleagues I work with.


I see. Do you work
at the royal institute then?


Well, I guess.


I see.


May I ask who we're speaking to?


Oh, forgive my belated introduction.


I am Shin So-eun.


There are no other empty seats,


-so go ahead--
-Actually, since we ran into each other,


why don't we sit down for a meal?


Four bowls of soup with rice, please.


Didn't you say you were busy?


Never did I imagine you having
an affectionate side, Royal Tutor Jung.


Affectionate?


How pretty.


The flowers, I mean.


Oh, these.


He spared me a few.


Anyway, how do you two know each other?


Well, that's…


It's a very long story.


Here's the food you ordered.


Goodness. We should eat first.


-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.


All right. Allow me to add a spoonful.


-Allow me.
-It's fine. I'll do it myself.


This is more of my specialty,
so let me do it.


I said it's fine!


Goodness. Are you all right?


I'll do it myself.


Lord Jung, your sleeves are also stained.


I'm… I'm fine, but…


GWANGHWAMUN


I guess it's been a while
since you set foot


in your homeland.


Homeland? What a joke.


NOKUNGAK


We did our best
to make your stay here with us


as comfortable as possible.


I do hope everything is up to par.


We appreciate all you have done for us.


You can speak more at ease now
for we have prepared much as well.


This ornamental knife
has accompanied us from Ming.


It's a lucky one, don't you think?


I'd rather rest, so please leave us.


I'm sure you're aware that a new emperor
ascended to the throne a year ago.


From what I hear,
those two played a major role.


This way, please.


They await you.


I'm glad you're here.


Why is Lord Sangheon meeting
with Royal Tutor Jung?


Royal Tutor Jung has
a history with the Vice Minister of Rites,


so he must be here to greet him.


Would you like to join them?


And say what at an uninvited event?


I'd only be interrupting them.


I heard I was urgently summoned.


Was it by you?


I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.


I'm the one who had you summoned.


Physician Jung!


It's been too long.


What brings you here?


I couldn't locate you in Ming,
so I thought the Left State Councilor


was pulling my leg
when he said he'd let me meet you.


Who knew we'd meet again like this?


Left State Councilor, I'm truly grateful.


To find out that one of my people
saved your life


was a great shock on my part.


I guess this is what destiny looks like.


As if that even qualifies
as saving one's life.


That's a little dramatic.


I'm afraid I must apologize.


Duty calls at
the Office of the Inspector General.


Physician Jung,
allow me to pour you a drink.


It truly has been too long.


I agree.


So the rumors about
the Left State Councilor


being the richest in Joseon were true.


Then tell me. What is it that he wants?


He was hoping to be given permission
to develop the land in Yeoyeon.


Yeoyeon?


Barbarians constantly invade that land.
Why would he want to develop…


I see.


He wishes to build an army under
the pretense of protecting the border.


How greedy of him.


Let him know
that he does not need to worry.


Thank you for the warm welcome.


However, if you had focused
more of your energy


on the roads leading to Joseon,


I wouldn't be so fatigued from the trip.


That means we'd be clearing a path
for the barbarians up north,


which is why we've been hesitant.


You still should have
cleared a road to Ming though.


Developing the land in Yeoyeon will make
trading with Ming less demanding.


That place is
a strategic point for our defense.


Hasty decisions cannot be made.


That's why I'm offering my assistance.


I will mention the issues
regarding Yeoyeon to the Emperor,


so all I suggest is that
you send a quick response.


Goodness.


Isn't she beautiful?


Especially the one in the second row.


Is there a girl who has caught your eye?


Please do not hesitate to tell me.


It can be ten or a hundred.
I'll make sure you receive them tonight.


I hear that girls sent as offerings
are quite adored.


One of them was blessed
into becoming an imperial concubine.


The girl to serve you tonight


will also be a lucky one.


I see.


So I can have my pick of girls?


Your request is my command.


From what I hear,
your wife's beauty is blinding.


Could I take her back with me?


Pardon?


Goodness. That was quite the jest.


A jest?


Then were you taunting me just now?


Being sent to Ming as an offering
is an honor


but not when it comes to your own family?


No, that is not what I meant.


What is the meaning of this?


There's nothing to be alarmed about.


It's just that this man
made promises to me that he can't keep.


I will punish him accordingly
once I gather all the facts,


so please let your anger subside.


Goodness. What is there
to investigate and find out?


If needed,


he can be executed on the spot.


Wait. But…


Please spare my life!


That is enough.


You are in the palace of Joseon.


His Majesty stated
that he'd get to the truth,


so let our system take over.


Leave and await your ruling.


Yes, Your Royal Highness!


This isn't your place.


Allow me to greet you.


I am Jung Ji-un,
a royal tutor at the royal institute.


You seem to be upset
at this festive banquet,


so I'd like to serve you a drink.


Would you accept it?


Please don't be like that
and accept this drink.


I'd consider it a great honor.


You speak out of place
knowing that you are favored


by the Vice Minister of Rites.


Get lost.


Because the drink was from you,


it was divine.


Is that so?


Then have some more.


That's about enough.


Do you not realize
that you're dishonoring the Emperor


by not showing courtesy?


Yes, that is enough.


So this is where you were,
Your Royal Highness.


Did you have to make me feel uneasy
by doing what I didn't order you to do?


It was an important banquet.


I was only worried
that things would escalate.


It is not your job to worry about me.


Pretend you didn't see anything


or hear anything from now on.


That is how you will be.


Wait. There's another child.
Go and get him.


-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.


Sit down.


I said sit down.


It is not your job to worry about me.


Is this what you serve as food?


Is there a problem?


That'd be my question to you.


What you served is nothing but waste.


What is one supposed to eat?


Forgive me.


I had the kitchen prepare what you enjoy,


but they must not suit your palate.


Prepare the food again.


-Yes, Your Royal Highness.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.


Has a decision been made regarding
the man who taunted me last night?


His mouth should have been
ripped at the corners


to stop him from spewing nonsense.


The Office of the Inspector General
is reviewing the case.


He will be severely punished
once they come to a ruling,


so please let your anger subside.


How about you just
let me deal with him instead?


Executing the punishment myself
means less work for you.


Even a man guilty of treason
is punished by law and custom.


So I suggest…


you drop this.


Acting tough, are we?


What…


did you just say?


What do you mean?


What was that?


You dare treat me with disdain?


How dare you communicate
in code in my presence!


That… That is not true, my lord.


Communicating in code?
That is hardly true.


I will have the food served again.


Follow me.


How dare you follow him out.


Damned wench, you just
don't know your place, do you?


Court Lady Kim!


What are you doing?


As you can see,
I'm teaching her some manners.


Why? Does this require
proper procedure too?


Do you know what I despise the most?


Words or actions of disrespect
which you just showed.


Today, you will be taught some manners.


Court Lady Kim!


Court Lady Kim…


Oh, no.


My gosh.


Court Lady Kim…


Your Royal Highness…


Your Royal Highness…


- Your Royal Highness, you must not!
- Your Royal Highness, you must not!


You must not do this.
Your Royal Highness, no!


Oh, no. Your Royal Highness…
