Hye-jin.


Yes?


When I go back down to Gongjin,
can you meet up with me?


Meet up?


Of course, I can.


I really hope you can.


I have something to tell you.


What?


They fixed the streetlamp.


Hye-jin, are you there?


Yes, I am.






Let me know when you're back.


I'll treat you to a meal.


Okay. I'll see you soon.


Okay. Drive safely.


-I will.
-Bye.


Who are you?


Who said you could enter my home?


We have a home security system.
The police will be here in no time.


I know there's no security system here.


I had it installed yesterday.


-What are you doing with your phone?
-What?


Are you calling the police?


There's no one to help you now.


What the hell?






Don't make a sound.


It's a great night
to catch a sick pervert.


Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?


-Did he hurt you?
-No.


-Are you really okay?
-I'm so terrified.


Yes, this is 14 Abnaru-gil, Gongjin-dong.


Hye-jin!


Chief Hong!


Chief Hong!


My gosh.


-What on earth happened?
-It was the damn pervert.


He deserves to rot in prison.


That was a close one.


-He should rot in jail.
-Watch your head.


-Can you believe it?
-What the hell?


EPISODE 10


There wasn't any nerve damage,
so stitches will be enough.


I'll get back to you soon.


Thank you, doctor.


What a relief.


Doesn't it hurt?


Of course it does.
Even paper cuts hurt like hell,


but the knife was this big.
At least 30cm, right?


Don't exaggerate.


It was a paring knife
with a blade length of around 15cm.


I thought you'd still be in shock,


but the doctor in you
calmed you down already.


That bruise. Did he hurt you?


Oh, it's nothing.


What are you talking about?
You're hurt. Let me see.


How bad is it? Does it hurt?


Why didn't you tell the doctor
when he was here?


Your injury is much worse.


Ms. Dentist.


Why are you crying?


Gosh, I was so scared.


Who jumps at a guy


with a knife in his hand?


I was just…


I was afraid he might hurt you.


Seriously.


Seong-hyeon?


Director Ji.


Hye-jin, are you all right?


How did you know I was here?


Oh, well…


I came back to pick something up


then saw police cars
and your neighbors near your place.


I rushed over here
as soon as I heard about you two.


-I see.
-Right.


Chief Hong, is the injury serious?


No, it's only a graze.


You seem more shocked than we are though.
Are you okay?


Me? No, I'm okay.


I was really worried.


I'm so relieved that you two are okay.


Well, I…


I came back…


because I forgot my tablet.


I need to head back up with my hard drive.


Now that I know you're okay,
I'll get going.


At this hour?


Yes. You must be really shocked,
so take good care of yourself.


Chief Hong, thank you
for saving Hye-jin. I mean it.


Don't mention it.


I'll get going then.


Right. Seong-hyeon--


We're ready for you. I'm afraid
only one guardian's allowed to stay.


Go receive your treatment.


Sure.


You jumped in front of a knife,
but you're afraid of needles?


Anyone who has been burned by hot soup
flinches at the sight of it.


Thank you.


That was out of the blue.


I don't think


I thanked you officially yet.


You did unofficially though.


Look at me.
The way you've been looking at me.


It's been shooting out words of gratitude.


That's ridiculous.


So what now?


What do you mean?


About tonight.
Your place is now a crime scene.


Oh, right.


Welcome, it's your…
No, it's not your first time.


It's my third.


As you know, three is a lucky number.


Like samseon jjajangmyeon


and best-of-three set matches.


And they say the third daughter is
always the prettiest.


That's so silly.


Anyway, it's better
than staying home alone tonight.


Ms. Pyo went to Seoul, right?


Yes.


Make yourself at home
and let me know if you need anything.


I need clothes to change into.


Right.


Should I go fetch some from your place?


Or would you like to wear
something of mine?


Would they fit?


-Would they be too small?
-Probably too big.


I see you're done.


The clothes are too big for me.


They are not. They fit you like a glove.


You know, you have such broad shoulders.


What do you mean?
It's clearly too big on me.


It's just that you have narrow shoulders.
They fit just right.


You just have to have the last word.


Anyway, drink this.


What is it?


Chamomile tea. Nothing's better
for relaxation and good sleep.


Drink while it's hot.


It'd better be good.


-What is this?
-Keep it on you.


It's easy to get aches
on a night like this.


Your muscles must be in shock.


Why do I need a blanket
on such a hot summer night?


I'm good.


You've got cramp.
See? This is what I was talking about?


Let me see. Does it hurt a lot?


What are you doing?


Didn't you wash your feet?


Of course I did.


Then stay still.


The spasm will get worse
if you don't treat it right away.


Meow if you don't have
anything better to do.


Meow…


Lick your nose too.


Forget it. You can stop now.
I think I'm good.


Really? Are you sure?


Yes.


All right.


What's with the special plates?
Is it someone's memorial service?


My grandfather.


When is it?


Tomorrow. Hold on.


It's past midnight, so today.


Do you remember a lot about him?


No, I don't.


I want to remember everything about him,


but it keeps fading away.


His voice, his gaze, and his hands…


He had rough palms, you see.


He was a sailor who then ran an oil shop


after my parents passed away,
so it's what you'd expect.


But his hands were so big
and exceptionally warm.


He raised me with them.


I bet you were a troublemaker
when you were little.


The boy in the photo
has "mischief" written on his face.


I was absolutely
all over the neighborhood.


I stole the squid
the old ladies had hung out to dry


and played soccer all day
until my neck was badly burned.


-Soccer?
-Yes, I loved the sport.


Just like you,
I had a pair of shoes I loved so much.


My blue soccer cleats.


I see.


Do you still enjoy soccer?


No, I don't anymore.
I don't even watch it.


Why not?


Because of soccer…


No, because of me,


my grandfather passed away.


He had a heart attack.


But he wasn't found in time.


If only I hadn't gone out…


to watch the World Cup matches.


Don't tell me you believe
that he wouldn't have passed away


had you been at home.


Those what-ifs are pointless.


There are too many variables in this world


and they're beyond our control.


So it's not your fault.


You've been thinking that way
all this time?


Your grandpa must've been fuming
in his grave.


Would he be that angry?


Of course.


Isn't this


the first time you talked about yourself?


You're right.


You're the second person


that I've told my personal stories.


Second?


How dense of me.


Tea won't cut it, right?


Are you done?


Second?


-Thank you.
-Enjoy.


Seong-hyeon, I enjoyed your show today.


Me too. You have a great voice.


Thank you so much.


-My gosh.
-Gosh, he's handsome.


He actually talked to us!


Babe, you look stunning today.


You should've dressed like this sooner.


Hold on. Did you perhaps
dress up like this since it's my birthday?


-Of course not.
-What?


Don't be mistaken.


It was for me, not you.


-What?
-You heard me.


You can wear
all the expensive clothes in the world


but you look like the cheapest person,


and I deserve better.


Cheap?


So you must've overheard me.


Let me explain.
Let's talk somewhere private.


No. I don't have any more time
to spare you in my life.


The three months I wasted
is more than enough.


Hye-jin!


Seong-hyeon.


Just a second.


Thanks, Seong-hyeon.


Those heels are pretty.


You know,


I spent two months' salary on these.


My hands shook at first,
but I just went for it.


Come to think of it,


I had never bought anything for myself.


You did good. You need to give
yourself a gift now and then.


But I guess all pretty things have thorns.


I didn't expect to see blood
on my first day wearing them.


-Just a second.
-What?


-These…
-But--


It'll be better
if you soften the back of them.


Nothing's easy at first you know.


Whether it's wearing shoes
or being in a relationship.


Here.


Much better now.


-Why don't we go eat something?
-Sounds good.


-Come on.
-Sure.


That was good.


I could tell.


I was only being polite
since you cooked it for me.


Why did you insist on cooking
with a bad arm though?


Well, I'm never going to let you
do anything in my kitchen again.


Why not?


Someone's calling you.


MI-SEON


Hey, Mi-seon. Did you get there safely?


-Yes.
-And your mom's surgery?


She was just taken to the operation room.


The doctor told me not to worry
since the procedure


isn't all that invasive.


I'm sure it'll go well, so don't worry.


What about you? Is everything all right?


Here? Of course, everything's good.


I'm fine.


Don't hurry back,
and be with your mom as long as you want.


You're on indefinite leave.


We'll see.


I've got to go.


Good night.


Sure.


Here, drink this.


-Thank you.
-Sure.


You should head back.
You have work in the morning, right?


It's my day off tomorrow. What about you?


Well, after my mom's surgery is over,


I'll stay until she wakes up


and leave early in the morning
when my sister comes.


Hye-jin told me to stay here,


but I should still go to work.


We can go together then.


Gosh, no.


Pulling an all-nighter
will only exhaust you.


Besides, I feel bad
you had to run into my father.


It's all right.
I'm more worried about you than myself.


You must be exhausted,
so get some shuteye.


I'll wake you up
as soon as your mother comes out.


But you must be more tired than I am.


I'm used to working the late shift.


So I'm not tired at all.


Don't just stand there. Come lie down.


I feel bad about chasing an injured man
out of his own bed.


Think of it
being reserved for the spooked.


All right, then.


You don't think
someone might break in again, do you?


With me here?


I meant, into my place.


If you want, I'll install
a front gate tomorrow.


What if someone climbs over it?


Then I'll put up a wire fence. No, wait.


Let's plant mines instead.


I'm just saying you can be at ease.


-My gosh!
-What the hell?


What was that?


It was only the wind.


-Wind?
-Darn it, it's unusually strong tonight.


-The wind?
-Yes.


It came out of nowhere.


-What now?
-Hey, Bugyeong!


-Bugyeong, you…
-Who's Bugyeong?


Gosh, that startled me.


It's the fishing village chief's dog.


-I see.
-He must've eaten something funny.


He's been howling like a wolf for days.


I see. Well, sweet dreams, Bugyeong.


-Good night.
-Bugyeong--


Go to sleep now.


-Sure.
-I'll be outside.


Okay.


So you'd rather stay up all night here?


What else can I do when I can't sleep?


You can go to bed.


I'll put you to sleep in five seconds.


-How?
-Just lie down. You'll find out.


All right.


Wait. Is that poetry?


Yes. To those who don't read
a lot of books like you,


this works like a charm.


I read a lot of books, you know.


Name one that inspired you
in five seconds.


-Five, four--
-Get reading.


Here I go then.


Well…


You can keep listening


or go to sleep.


"Doorkeeper.


'You can't be here.'


Saying that is my job.


It is my job to deny your purpose.


It is also my job
to deny you the next day again.


And waiting for you the next day
in order to deny you


is also my job.


It is my job to fall in love with you


while waiting for you


the next day.


Thus, denying my love…"


Chief Hong.


Who is


the first person you told


about your grandfather?


There was this person.


Someone very warm-hearted.


Damn it.


What? The pervert
that broke into Dr. Yoon's place


is the one who tried to abduct Ms. Yu?


-Exactly.
-My gosh.


I just got back
from testifying at the police station.


-No way.
-Lieutenant Kim said


he has 11 priors.


-What?
-Eleven priors?


They found a truckload of
women's clothes that he'd stolen.


Remember that red bra of mine I mentioned?


He's the one who took it.


It was among the items he stole.


That son of a bitch.


-He must've stolen my dress then!
-Right.


My gosh. When did that foul man
come to live here in Gongjin?


About two months ago,


after wandering around
after getting out of prison.


But he couldn't shake the habit.


That damn pervert!


He deserves to have
his limbs ripped piece by piece.


That son of a bitch deserves hell.


-That pervert--
-Can I see him if I go to the station?


You foolish…


By the way, is it Sunday?
Why are you here?


You should be in school!


-Yes, you should be in school.
-Stop nagging me!


-Go on.
-You'll be late again.


-Hye-jin!
-You--


My gosh.


I'll text you later,
so tell me all the details. Bye!


-Dr. Yoon!
-Dr. Yoon, are you all right?


Hello, all.


I was so shocked to hear what happened.


I heard he cut your arm with a knife.


It must hurt. Oh, dear.


Goodness. Dr. Yoon,


you look haggard now.


-Are you all right?
-Once again, rumors travel fast.


I'll tell you.
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.


And as you can see,
Ms. Dentist seems fine too.


Who are you to speak for me?


She's right. Be quiet.


Anyway, I'm fine.


I'm sorry for concerning you.


Please don't say that.
As your landlady, I'm completely ashamed.


I'll get you a security system right away.


-Yes, you should.
-Thank you.


In the meantime, have this calming pill.


Taking this when you've been startled


will calm your heart right back down.
Have it now.


There. Go ahead.


-Thank you.
-Sure thing.


There you go.


Chew and swallow even though it's bitter.


Ms. Gam-ri, what about me? Where's mine?


Well, I only had one at home.


I'll get you one later on.


Dr. Yoon, I brought this from my store.


Have some honey water.


What? Again, where's mine?


-Seriously?
-Because I only had one.


Are you actually on your way to work?


Shouldn't you be taking the day off?


I can't let the clinic close for the day.


Then stay right here.
I'll get you a cup of coffee.


-Your favorite, iced Americano.
-No, it's fine.


I just want to get you some, so wait here.


What about me?


-Where's mine?
-Stop it.


By the way,


how did Chief Hong
come to your aid last night?


I'm glad he did,


but were you two there together
that late at night?


This I should hear.


Right? You guys
showed up here together as well.


My gosh.


I have to say,
the curiosity is killing me.


Why on earth are you all giggling?


Because we're curious.


Gosh.


Is it just me, or is everyone
more worried about you than me?


Why do you keep following me?


You'll end up at the clinic at this rate.


That's where I'm headed.


Why?


To get a free cup of coffee.


Today, I'm craving instant coffee.


We do serve a great instant coffee.


-Hye-jin!
-Du-sik!


Hey, Eun-cheol.


Mi-seon.


How come you're here together?


We heard about what happened last night.


Are you all right?


Why didn't you say anything
when I called last night?


I didn't want you to worry.


I'm fine, so don't worry.


How's your mom?


Yes, her surgery went well.


It's all thanks to you.


That's a relief.


I told you to stay by her side.


Why did you hurry back here?


Well, I'm glad I did.


Look what happened overnight!


My gosh.


I won't leave you ever again.


I'll be right next to you
as if we were joined at the hip.


Talk about déjà vu.


Tell me about it.


Are you all right though?
I heard you hurt your arm.


Where does it hurt?


-Which--
-Let go.


-Were you terrified?
-Yes.


-Are you crying?
-It was scary.


-Of course.
-But…


What's the deal with Officer Choi?


Oh, that?


Well, he drove me
to the hospital in Seoul.


He even stayed with me
until my mom was out of surgery,


and drove me back here.


What?


That's what I call
being taken out of the friend zone.


While he sat with me outside the OR,


I was reminded of old memories.


When my dad was hospitalized,


Pil-seung never came to visit him
at the hospital.


He was afraid
my parents might bring up marriage


if he met them.


I knew we should've killed
that rat bastard.


At first, it was Eun-cheol's looks
that I was drawn to.


My heart beats faster for those
who look like Hong Kong movie stars.


-Right.
-But now I'm in trouble.


I think I'm in love with him.


Wait. Isn't that a good thing though?


Yeong-guk,
I've never had any romantic feelings


for you.


I hope we can continue being good friends.


You'll never know why I wanted a divorce.


Fine. Let's keep it that way forever.


Just live your life.


My goodness. You startled me.


Why are you acting like you saw a ghost?


Damn it.
The stress could actually kill me.


Always the scaredy-cat.


So what brings you by?


I'm here on official business, sir.


Is that so? Then have a seat, ma'am.


I'm sure you're aware of the unfortunate
incident that took place last night.


Yes. I mean, yes, ma'am.


So the zone chiefs
and area chiefs discussed


and decided to form
a civilian patrol unit.


And that's final.


So you discuss it with City Hall


to get us extra security measures


such as security cameras and alarm bells.


-Answer me.
-Sure.


Don't just say yes, and do it.


I'll be counting the days starting today.


Hold on a second.


Are you leaving already?


I said my piece, so why should I stay?


Well, I'm not done yet.


We need to talk about a private matter.


-What you said yesterday--
-I have nothing more to say.


-Hwa-jeong, please. I--
-Hello?


Hey, Yun-gyeong.


Yes, sure thing.


I should be there today.


Yes, of course. Got it.


What is it?


What the hell is it?


Tell me what it is. It's driving me nuts!


Just tell me already!


Fix it for me!


Dad, please!


Bo-ra, come on.


How can you act this way


when your parents work
their fingers to the bone


to provide for you?


I-jun, I'm fine.


I'm a merciful saint.


My game console!


What's with this quiet yet familiar scene?


-Hey.
-Hi, Uncle Hong.


Hey, I-jun.


Bo-ra, who on earth upset you?


Uncle Du-sik,
Dad won't fix my game console.


Is that so? Is that what upset you?


Oh, my. Look at these big drops of tears.


But you should know
it's not that he won't fix it.


He just can't.


He's a fool, you see.


No matter what happens,


-I will not lose my cool.
-I'll fix it for you.


I'm a genius.


Where is it? I-jun, can you get it for me?


Thanks.


Let me see. So this is it.


Screwdriver.


You seem fine for someone
who got nicked by a knife.


-Are you disappointed?
-No.


I'm relieved, that's all.


I guess I was worried.


-I have an order to place.
-Don't.


-It's--
-Hey, Yun-gyeong.


I called to say that I'm closing up
my hardware store for good.


-It's--
-You're busy, so I should shut up?


-It's--
-I love you too.


-It's--
-Don't say it.


-Hey--
-Quiet.


-I'm merciful.
-Your dad is what?


-A fool. And I'm what?
-I'm a saint.


PLACEMENT OF ORDER
WINDOW LOCK


Wait.


Isn't that Director Ji's car?


WRITER WANG


Hello?


Are you insane?


How can the main director
not show up for editing?


You're right to call me insane.


What is it? Where are you right now?


In Gongjin.


What? Why are you still there?


No way.


Does this concern your good luck charm?


Dr. Yoon?


I've known you for seven years,


but I've never seen you this way.


Seong-hyeon.


A ship can't be navigated properly
without its captain.


Sorry.


Ji-won, can you cut me some slack
just for one day?


Just today.


Starting tomorrow,
I'll pull myself together again.


It's just for today then.


Don't let your personal life
affect work again.


Until when will you see me
only as a co-worker?


CHIEF HONG


But he doesn't have any relatives.


Is he hosting the memorial service
all by himself?


Aren't you getting off?


I have a few things to sort out.
You should head home first.


Should I wait?


No, don't.
You must be tired from the long night,


so go home and rest.


Then come home before it gets too dark


and call me if anything happens.


Got it. See you later.


Sure.


Ms. Pyo.


If you're free,


can we have some coffee?


Didn't you say coffee?


Well, that's just something
people commonly say.


I prefer beverages
that taste like herbal tonics.


Anyway, I asked you to have coffee with me


to say something.


I have something to say too.


Sorry? Then you should go first.


Okay.


Well…


I wanted to thank you once again
for what you did yesterday.


There's no need.
I just did what I needed to do.


Right. Your occupation
requires you to serve the people,


and you offered me your services
for two days.


Right?


Sorry?


I've dated my fair share of guys.


I was offended when you talked
about how easily I start dating,


but you were right.


And that time,
my feelings for you weren't serious.


However,


those feelings ended up
growing into something more.


I'm scared that they might grow


as big and tall as Jack's beanstalk.


But that's not me, you see.


-Ms. Pyo--
-So I…


So I…


have decided to put a lid on my feelings.


Sorry?


I'll put some distance between us
so that you won't feel uncomfortable.


So you can keep being comfortable with me


and only consider me
as one of the citizens.


ASSORTED JEON FOR SALE


Is he inside?


-No, I'm out here.
-My gosh!


You startled me.
Don't sneak up on people like that.


Is spying and being shameless
your specialty?


You're in my yard.


What brings you by?


You said it's your grandfather's
memorial service today.


You can't cook since you hurt your arm,
so I picked up some jeon--


Chief Hong!


-Hey, Dr. Yoon.
-Hello, Ms. Yeo.


What brings you by?


I cooked these as a snack
but made too much.


Serve them for today's service.


A snack? This is too much.


It's really nothing.


Starting from the bottom,
there's beef jeon,


-croaker jeon,
-Croaker.


pollack jeon, tofu jeok,
and flat meatballs.


Nothing, did you say?
It doesn't get more luxurious than this.


This is the least I could do.


My family got out of the hole


after we took over
his oil shop 20 years ago.


We'll return the favor for generations.


Is I-jun on board with that?


I-jun's motto is to carry
one's gratitude beyond the grave.


-I'll get going then.
-Thanks, Hwa-jeong.


-Have a good day.
-Thanks!


-Bye.
-Bye.


Thanks!


What were you saying again?


Well, I bought some jeon--


-Goodness.
-Hello, ladies.


My gosh. Ms. Gam-ri, what is all this?


-Give it here.
-Chief Hong.


It's red snow crab.


-Gosh.
-Let me take that.


You're supposed to serve octopus,
but it's currently a closed season.


So I steamed some crabs instead.


-Gosh--
-I seasoned some vegetables for you.


-Ms. Mat-i.
-Chief Hong,


I made beef radish soup. It's still hot.


Ms. Suk-ja, this must've been heavy.


-I got you some pollack and halibut.
-I see.


-Thanks, Nam-suk.
-Sure.


I brought some jujube and chestnuts.


Geum-cheol peeled the latter for you.


You brought this over
when you're close to popping?


-Du-sik.
-Hey, Chun-jae.


These are apples and pears.


-Gosh.
-I just found them on the street.


-Watch it.
-Goodness.


Since I can't cook,


I bought some hangwa and yakgwa.


-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes, hello.


Everyone knows everything
in this neighborhood.


As if it's anything new.


Shouldn't you get on it?


Yes, I should.


Do you need any help?


No, I can handle it on my own.


Thank you, everyone.


It's nothing new.


We just have a lot of free time.


I can't believe what I'm seeing.


Are you really the dentist I know?


Did someone assume your identity?


That sure is a lame joke.


Stop that and just take this.


Just a second.


-What are you doing?
-Didn't you buy this for my grandpa?


I did, but--


You got it from the market, right?


My grandpa especially loved
their perilla leaf jeon.


You sure have an eye for good food.


MAY YOU REST IN PEACE


I should get going.


Enjoy your time with your grandfather.


You can stay if you want.


What?


If you want.


Grandpa.


It sure is a feast today, isn't it?


Everyone in the neighborhood pitched in.


Please enjoy whatever you want.


There's a lot that you like.


Would you like to say hello?


Hello.


I'm Yoon Hye-jin.


A 34-year-old dentist.


I hope we get along.


What's with the introduction?


You told me to say hello.


We'll eat in ten minutes.


He was always a fast eater, you see.


Chief Hong, you spoke in a dialect.


This is my hometown after all.
I spoke in one when I was a boy.


Right, of course.


Snow crab at a memorial service
is a rare sight for me.


It's my first time serving it.
He used to love it though.


I see. You and him must have
liked different taste in food.


You don't like snow crab.


Me? Not at all.


What? But that's what you said.


What should we have? Snow crab?


No. Something else.


That's because
I couldn't be bothered at the time.


I enjoy crabs,
but peeling them is a hassle.


Besides, there are so many other dishes.


I see.


What are you doing?


Did you just…


peel it for me?


Well, it must be even more bothersome


with that injured arm.


Thanks.


Sure thing.


Gosh.


This was your plan all along.


Of course not.
It landed near your right dimple though.


-Where? Here?
-Here. Eat it.


There you go.


Unbelievable.


You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?


-Of course not. It really was a mistake.
-Aren't you?


It won't happen again, so enjoy.


Really?


Shrimps and crabs are
too bothersome to eat.


Compared to the effort you put in,


the outcome is too small.


It's still delicious though.


I know. Come to think of it,
my grandpa is the only one


who's ever peeled them for me.


Right. Peeling these are a true hassle.


It takes a lot of love
to do this for someone else.


Well…


However, right now,


this is a special occasion.


It's my fault you got injured.


You're right.
This will take four weeks to recover.


It hurts.


-Just eat.
-Okay.


It's good.


It's really good.


Wait. Let me walk you home.


You don't have to.
You have a lot to tidy up.


Forget about that. It's dark outside.
Think about what happened last night.


I live right around the corner


and Mi-seon's home today.


-I can call her on my way home.
-But still--


No, don't walk me out.


Bye. Don't walk me out.


But…


Did I really say "love"?


What the hell was I babbling on about?


I should sew my lips together for good.


Hey, Hye-jin.


Seong-hyeon?


Were you waiting for me?


Yes.


You should've called.


How was your trip to Seoul?


What? Oh, it was good.


I asked you to spare me some time
once I got back from Seoul.


Can you spare me some now?
Or is this a bad time?


-Right now?
-Yes.


We should eat. I'm hungry.


Sure thing.


I'm sorry about this.
I already had dinner.


Are you okay eating alone?


Yes, of course.


Go ahead before the ice melts.


Okay.


-Hye-jin.
-Yes?


Hye-jin.


Yes?


I…


Hye-jin.


Yes, that's me.


Right.


Jeez.


I'm sorry to ask,
but could you say "Action" for me?


"Action"?


Yes, I practiced a whole speech for today,


but I'm finding it
hard to actually say it.


Can you do it for me?


I don't know what this is about,


but here goes. "Action."


Hye-jin, there's one thing
I regret in life, and that's…


And that's…


What is it?


Well, it's…


You see…


Seong-hyeon, could it be…


Yes?


Are you in financial trouble?


What? No, that's not it.


If that's the case,


I could lend you some
although it wouldn't be much.


Not telling you how I felt.


I've been regretting
not telling you how I felt 14 years ago.


Then I ran into you again in Gongjin,


and I thought long and hard about it.


I didn't know if the butterflies
in my stomach were due to my past feelings


or if they're the feelings
I have for you currently.


The conclusion I came to is this.


I like you.


Just like I did all those years ago.


No, even more than that.


I like you a lot.


Gosh, please don't.


I don't want to burden you.


And I'm not asking
for an immediate answer.


I just wanted to tell you
before it was too late.


I didn't want to regret it again.


My gosh.


I think I can finally eat.


I'll really have this all myself.


Sure. Go ahead.


This looks delicious.


It's so good.


Grandpa.


My friend was a bit loud, wasn't she?


That's just how she is.


She talks and giggles a lot.


You easily get distracted in her presence.


Still…


it feels empty now that she's not around.


What took you so long?


Oh, I met up with Seong-hyeon.


He was waiting for me outside.


For what reason at this hour?


What? Did he confess
his feelings for you or something?


Mi-seon.


Get ready for a career change.


You're firing me over a joke?


No, I'm saying you should
set up shop as a fortune teller.


Really?


Right? What did I tell you?


I told you
Seong-hyeon had feelings for you.


Wait. Why don't you seem happy?


It's just complicated, that's all.


What could possibly be complicated?


He's from a nice family and has
a good job and a great personality.


He's the man of your dreams.


Besides, you used to have a crush on him.


Fate brought you together again,


and he finally confessed his feelings,


so what's holding you back?


It's just that…


Because of Chief Hong?


Are you serious?


No, it's not.
Anyway, that's enough about me.


What about you?


How are things between
you and Officer Choi?


I told him I'd back off.


-What?
-He's right, you know.


I don't take relationships seriously
and I'm scared of commitment.


But you finally met
someone you truly like.


And I think
there's a chance for something real,


but you're backing down?


What's with us both?


No wonder we're friends.


How about we go to Seoul this weekend?


Seoul?


I mean, we'll never be able
to take our mind off these things here.


And I could really use some diversion.


We could go shopping
and eat something delicious.


Yes, and have fun at a hotel!


-Yes!
-Yes!


Let's do this
We're off to Seoul


Off we go.


I'm stoked right now.
What should we do first?


Isn't it obvious?
First, we visit your mom.


No need for that. She already
got better and is now at my aunt's.


Besides, she grew sick of me
after seeing me for two days in a row.


Really?


Then what should we do? Any ideas?


Shopping? No, wait.


How about a hotel pool?


No, let's get a massage at the spa.


Why choose when we can do them all?


Seriously. Could you be any smarter?


-Hey.
-Yes?


I see you did your hair
for our trip to Seoul.


Those are some sweet curls you put in.


I know. The curling iron
worked well today…


What is it?


-Oh, no.
-What is it?


Damn it. I think I left it plugged in.


What?


What do I do? Should we head back?


Unbelievable.


What are you doing? Who are you calling?


-What?
-The emergency service?


No, Chief Hong.


Right, there's always Chief Hong.


No. No way!


Don't call Chief Hong. Hang up!


-No, don't!
-Chief Hong?


No! I'm serious. You can't!


Don't!


Is that Ms. Dentist?
Please tell her to be quiet.


Chief Hong, could I offer you an easy job?


What is it?


Could you go to my place right now,


enter Hye-jin's room,
locate the dressing table,


and unplug the curling iron on it?


What? You've got to be kidding me.
You can do that yourself.


We're currently far away from the house.


-Where?
-In Seoul.


You went to Seoul? When will you be back?


Tomorrow.


So please help us out this once.


You can't let us burn down
Ms. Yeo's house.


Right, I'll get it done.
That's all you need, right?


-Yes! He'll do it.
-No, wait.


Chief Hong, all you need to do
is enter the house,


take a left, and unplug the curling iron.


Don't look at--


He hung up.


Damn it.


Whatever.


Yes, whatever.


Let's just go.


Who knew I'd be doing a job like this?


Stay calm. You expected this.


You didn't expect her
to keep the house pristine.


That's right.


Damn it.


What the hell?


Are you kidding me?


I can't believe
they made me waste my time.


Damn it.


All right.


Here too.


Good.


And now…


All done.


Hye-jin, look. Do you think it'll suit me?


Yes, it's adorable
and will look good on you.


Right? I guess I have my figure to thank.


I should still try it on though.


Sure. There's a fitting room over there.


Really? Just a second. This is adorable.


It'll look good on him.


-Hye-jin!
-Yes?


No way! Twirl for me.


Wait. Like this?


It's pretty. It's perfect for you.


No, this isn't the one.
Let's go over there instead.


-Sure.
-I bet they have prettier ones.


Hey. What do you think of this?


It's a nice shade of purple.
You should check it out.


How is it? Is it good?


It's so good


that I wouldn't notice
even if the others stopped breathing.


Must you always be that annoying?


Is seeing me die something you want?


I only meant it in a figurative sense.


Ms. Gam-ri.


How is it?


Why do people even
have something like this?


It's sickly sweet
and too cold for my teeth.


But you enjoyed it the most.


That's only because it's so hot.


By the way, where's the restroom?


It's right over there.


Mat-i, I'm coming with you.


Why on earth would you
follow me to the restroom?


Because I want to go too.


I should get them new dishes.


-That hurts.
-Of course it does.


Weren't you aware of that
when you took the knife for her?


The situation called for the action.


Du-sik, you have feelings
for the dentist, don't you?


Not this again.


We're just friends.


I turned 80 this year.


All my life, I've been diving under water
fishing out abalones and sea urchins.


I can now see through people
like I see through water.


She has taken up
all the space in your heart,


so why on earth are you fighting it?


Du-sik, life may seem long,


but it really isn't.


Throw away unnecessary thoughts


and be honest with yourself.


Okay?


HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT


Cho-hui!


It's a little early for dinner,


but it's better than having it late.


I was hungry anyway. Thank you.


I hope it's not too salty.


It's perfect.


I heard from the police
that you gave them a statement.


Thank you.


I'm so relieved he was caught.


It could've been terrible
for you and Dr. Yoon.


Right.


So how have you been?


How's your mother?
Didn't she suddenly collapse back then?


She passed away last year.


She needed help after collapsing,


so I took care of her.


Your mother must've tried very hard
to stay by her daughter's side longer.


It must've been hard on you too.


What about your brother?
Don't you have one?


He emigrated to the US
about ten years ago.


So it's just you.


Loneliness must've drawn you back here.


You used to love seokbakji.


I still remember you devouring it
when you first rented our room.


You remember that?


It must be because
I value eating the most.


I tend to remember
things related food well.


Meanwhile, Yeong-guk
gets the blues every season,


so no wonder he and I don't get along.


Hwa-jeong,


Yeong-guk and I--


I heard.


But what happened isn't your fault.


Mom!


Why keep the floor this slippery?


Ms. Yu!


Hi, I-jun.


Hello.


I-jun, did you have fun today?


-Hey.
-Hey.


Would you like some dinner too?


No, I have urgent business
and should get going.


Have fun.


Gosh.


It's fine.


He won't die, so eat up.


It sure is nice to be here.


Now I know why everyone
wants an apartment by Han River.


Is that so?


What's with that dry response?


Maybe I've been away for too long,


but Han River is narrower than I remember.


What?


I mean, compared to the sea
I always look at in Gongjin.


I see.


We haven't had a course meal in ages.


Gosh, this smell of butter.


Hye-jin, we're having lobster.


I love my life. I really do.


Why are you giggling?


Oh, it's just that the lobster
reminded me of something.


Recently, I had red snow crabs
with Chief Hong


and the crab meat got on his face
as I snapped the shell open.


That was so funny.


You haven't tried them, have you?


They're much better
than imported lobsters.


Maybe it's because
it was directly from Gongjin Harbor,


but the crab meat was so sweet and soft.


There wasn't any sauce,
but it was still delicious.


-Hye-jin.
-Yes?


You've been weird today.


How so?


You're not yourself.


At the department store,


though you acted like
you'd max out your credit card,


you didn't buy any shoes or clothes.


All you did was look at men's clothes.


When did I ever--


And even now,


you keep talking about Gongjin


as if all roads lead to it.


Right.


Why am I being a party pooper?


You know what?


In order to get
the Gongjin vibe out of me,


we should go to a spa after this.


Sure. Sounds good.


It's so good. I absolutely love it.


It's raining.


The forecast never mentioned one.


Maybe it's a shower.


But we need to head to the parking lot.


You have an umbrella, right?


It's not far away, so let's run.


What?


Why do you keep acting weird?


What do you mean?


You hate getting wet in the rain.


Feeling uncomfortable and damp
is your worst nightmare.


Are you nuts? I'm all drenched!


So? Don't you feel refreshed?


No, I don't.
It feels uncomfortable and damp.


So what?
Let your hair down and just feel it.


You're bound to meet
unexpected situations in life.


Even if you use an umbrella,
you'll end up getting drenched.


Just put your hands up
and welcome the rain.


Hye-jin, what's with you?


Where'd you get this?


On the street.


-Are you okay?
-Chief Hong?


So you're okay.


It's so hot.


I guess someone got the romance going.


It's unnecessarily pretty.


Don't go.


Don't…


leave me behind.


Ms. Dentist?


Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?


Are you really okay? Did he hurt you?


Hye-jin!


What's the matter with you?


You just ran out like some crazy woman,
and it's scaring me.


And you happen to be in a floral dress.
It makes you look crazier!


Mi-seon.


I think I should go.


Go where?


To Gongjin.


What?


I'll call you later, okay?


Yoon Hye-jin, that crazy wench!


She finally came to a realization.


Congratulations on the level-up.


Way to go, my friend!


What am I supposed to do now?


Chief Hong.


Chief Hong, are you home?


MS. DENTIST


Chief Hong!


Chief Hong.


Ms. Dentist?


I thought you wouldn't be back
until tomorrow.


I couldn't wait until tomorrow
to say this.


I like you.


I have feelings for you.


I'm one of those people
who plan every second of their lives


according to a lifespan of 99 years.


I don't like people crossing the line
or crossing it myself.


And I'm fond of expensive shoes.


I guess I'm your complete opposite.


It's the same with
our blood types and personalities.


I bet we're not compatible in any aspect.


We're probably as different as
penguins that eat krill


and polar bears that feed on sea lions.


But to hell with all of that…


because I like you.


Ms. Dentist, I--


Don't say anything.


I'm not asking anything from you.


I…


My feelings for you
keep inflating my heart,


and it could burst at any second.


I can't help it anymore.


I…


I can't…


deny it anymore either.


Do you like them?


I love them! I'm going to
play soccer in these every day.


Stop gawking at the shoes


and blow out the candles on your cake.


No, I have to make a wish first.


Please let me and Grandpa
live a long and happy life together.


Blow them out already
before the cake gets covered in wax.


I won't ask for much,


so please grant this old man's wish.


When Du-sik ends up all alone,


please send him someone


so that he won't be lonely.


Please send him someone
who will be good for him.


All right. One,


two…


three!


That little girl…


was Ms. Dentist?


Can we hold off being a couple
for a few days?


Are you having second thoughts
now that you have to dump him?


I want time to sort out
the past I've had with Seong-hyeon


and the time I'll be spending with you.


Hye-jin dumped me.
She says that she already likes someone.


Today's our first day as a couple, right?


Were you always this physically oriented?


Why don't you lock
the front door from now on?


Chief Hong!


I've lived for 34 years without you,


but each day seems
to last forever since I've met you.
