The sheriff and highway patrol are aware.


Okay. Thank you, Bert.
Just can you keep me posted, please?


Okay. Bye-bye.


[knocking on door]


- Hi.
- Hey. Any word yet?


No, no.


So who's doing what?


Preacher is driving through town, looking.


Um...


Brie and Brady are walking the riverbank


and Mike is trying
to track Jack's cell phone.


When I left the B and B,
Jo Ellen was still manning the phone tree.


Bert and his mechanic are out looking.


Good. So, what can I do?


- You sure you wanna stay?
- I won't let you handle this by yourself.


Well, the hospital said I could call back,


- if you could call them.
- I'll call. Grace Valley?


- Okay.
- Thank you.


[phone ringing]


- Jack?
- [Stacie] Mel, it's Stacie.


Did you get my message?


Stacie, hi.


Hey, so I'm in Clear River.


I was hoping
we could have dinner tomorrow.


Listen. I'm dealing with an emergency,


- so I can't talk. I...
- I really need to see you.


[phone beeps]


I'm getting another call.
Just call me tomorrow. Oh, God.


Hello?


[woman] No John Does
in the last hours, Dr. Hayek.


All right.


Could you transfer me
to the morgue, please?


[theme music playing]


Mel, just hang in there.


We will find him. Yeah.


What did Mel say?


[sighs] No sign of him yet.


I can't just sit around here.
I'll drive around...


You shouldn't be driving
with your macular thing.


Fine, fine.


- I'll call Denny.
- He's at the movies.


- His phone's off.
- See?


I'll go.


A, you are not cleared to drive,


and, B, you just said you had a headache.


I'll take more aspirin.


Let me repeat,
you are not cleared to drive.


We're getting to be like your truck.


Something breaks,
they no longer make replacement parts.


- It is called aging.
- God.


I wish Lilly was here.


She'd be over in a flash.


Muriel. Sorry to call so late,
but do you think you could drive...?


That would be great. Yes.


- She's on her way.
- And then what?


Well, we grid the county map


and then we drive one section at a time.


Pull up a photo of Jack
in case we need to show it to some people.


- Vernon, we have to find him.
- We will leave no stone unturned.


[phone ringing]


[beeps]


Hey.


[crying] Hey, Preach.


You found anything yet?


No. Sorry.


What if he had an accident
and he's trapped?


We've got all hands on deck.
We'll find him.


It's been six hours
since anybody has heard from him.


We've got to stay positive.


I know. I'm trying.


Actually, hold on.
I think I see something.


- What the hell, Jack?
- What are you doing here?


- Looking for you.
- What?


- I got him, Mel.
- My God. Thank God.


Oh, sh*t. I need to get to the wedding.


It's over, man.


- Huh?
- It's over.

Mel, I'm so sorry I missed the wedding.
I know how important that was to you.


Oh. Okay, okay.
Right, so that's what you're sorry about.


[scoffs]


- I thought something happened to you.
- No, I'm fine.


Oh, yeah.
Well, clearly that's not the case.


Look. I, um...


Something came up
and I didn't handle it well.


Great, so you decided to drink.


I thought I could sleep it off.


I don't even know what to say to that.


[scoffs] You know,
I had the entire town looking for you.


I'll apologize to everyone, but right now
I wanna make things right with you.


Mel, look, I know I messed up.


Okay? I'm sorry.


Just go.

Not yet.


- You're something else, you know that?
- The feeling's mutual.


And thanks again for last night.


I know going to a wedding and then
helping me look for Jack wasn't fun.


It was fine.


And at least he's okay, you know?


I just don't understand.


- He's always been so responsible.
- That's the problem.


He acts like he's untouchable, but...


the stuff he's seen...


it's dark.


It doesn't magically disappear


just because you pretend
you got everything figured out.


Well, how did you handle it
when you got back?


Not well.


I got in fights, went to jail.


I didn't do it the right way, but...


I did let go of a lot of stuff.


Jack is hurting.
I don't know how to help him.


Just be there.


When I got back,
I didn't have anyone I could talk to.


My uncle had his own problems.
And I think if I had someone I felt...


close to, it would have really helped.


And how do you feel now?


Now I feel happy.


I know it won't last,
but right now, everything's good.


- What do you mean, it won't last?
- This is you taking a break.


Yeah, at some point,
you'll wanna go back to the city,


your big corporate legal job


with your fundraisers
and your opera tickets.


It just ain't my world.


- I hate opera.
- You know what I mean.


Brady. This isn't some vacation fling.


I'm in love with you.


Right now, that's true.
And that's enough for me.


All right,
well, in case I haven't said it already,


thanks for bringing me back to my truck,
for putting me up last night.


My couch is your couch.


You talk to Mel?


- She's not picking up her phone.
- What are you gonna do?


Go to the clinic, apologize.


Hope she's calmed down.


- I don't blame her for being mad at you.
- Neither do I.


[Preacher] Hey, listen, man.


I want you to know that I think of you
as family, so I'll be straight with you.


Work out your issues,
find out what's going on up here.


Hmm.


Talk to Barry Martinez, he's a therapist.


Tell me, how is a civilian gonna
understand what I'm dealing with?


He did two tours in the Marines.


He's got a master's in psychology
and he runs my veterans support group.


I told you, I'm not gonna be
sitting around in a circle


with a group of guys
talking about my feelings.


He does one-on-ones. I've been doing them
since Christopher disappeared.


Without Barry, I would've lost it.


Glad therapy works,
but don't think it's my thing.


Whatever it is you're doing,
it ain't working.


At least give it a try, man.


- What is that?
- Blueberry muffins for Muriel.


As a thank-you for last night.
Can you drop them off on your way to work?


Well, sure, sure. That was...
That was very thoughtful of you.


She was a good sport last night.


For putting up
with your backseat driving, she sure was.


Jack is safe,
and that's all that needs to be said.


Mm-hm.


Have you seen Denny?


Yeah, he left a note,
said he's running errands.


Oh.


So...


what are you doing today?


I don't know.


I can't stop thinking about Lilly.


Last night made me realize how much
I depended on her in emergencies.


Muriel is not exactly a calming influence.


Mm. Mm.


Why don't you give Tara a call?


Maybe seeing her
would help you feel closer to Lilly.


Maybe, or it'll make me miss her more.


What if seeing you makes Tara feel better?


That'd be pretty good, wouldn't it?


Hey. Mel here?


- She's in with a patient.
- I'll wait.


- You want some coffee?
- Sure.


- How do you take it? Black?
- Yeah, thanks.


- Cheers.
- Yeah.


So any idea how long she's gonna be?


It's hard to say.
She's been out of sorts this morning.


- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's tired, distracted.


- Last night was hard on her.
- Right.


I know this is none of my business,
but it's obvious how much she loves you.


It is none of your business.


I'm just trying to help.
Mel's a great woman and...


Look, I don't know what you're hoping
to get out of the situation.


You have no idea
what you're talking about.


I'm not hoping to get anything.
I'm simply observing.


Do me a favor,
keep your observations to yourself.


Hey.


I need to talk to you outside.


Thanks for the coffee.


[sighs]


What the hell was that?


Why are you being rude to Cameron?


He got under my skin.


Okay. What are you doing here?


I need five minutes.


What happened last night was unacceptable,
and I'm sorry I made you worry.


Okay, you know what?
Worry doesn't come close.


I thought you were in a ditch.


- I couldn't drive.
- Oh, right.


Right. You couldn't drive.


- What happened to quitting?
- Last night was an exception.


The night of my sister's wedding
was an exception.


Look, it's not gonna happen again.


- How am I supposed to believe you?
- I made a decision.


I'm done. I'm done with drinking.
I'm done with living in the past.


Jack, trauma is not a switch
you can turn on and off by yourself.


I know. I get it.


- You get it?
- Yeah.


Then why do we keep having
this conversation?


You know what?
I can't talk to you anymore.


[door slams]


[phone ringing]


Hey, Stacie.


Hi. Oh, I'm glad you answered.


- So can you meet me for dinner?
- Tonight's not a good night. I...


I really need to see you.


I know, but I didn't sleep
at all last night.


Can we do it tomorrow?


Paul and I are leaving in the morning.
What if you go early?


Hey. Here to pick up Hope's lunch order.


- Tuna on rye?
- Unfortunately, that's the one.


- Not a fan of tuna?
- Not when it's in my car.


Hey, so Ten Pins in Clear River's doing
cosmic bowling tonight. Wanna go?


Um...


I can't. Preacher's leaving early,
so I'm closing tonight.


- How about tomorrow night?
- Maybe. I'll have to check with Connie.


Okay. No worries.


Just let me know.


- Okay.
- See you later.


- Why are you lying to him?
- Why are you spying on me?


I have never seen you volunteer
to talk to Connie about anything.


- Ugh. You're so annoying.
- But I'm right.


Fine. I was looking for a phone charger


and I found a stash
of Klonopin in Denny's stuff.


- What did you do?
- I told Doc.


Why did you do that?


Because it wasn't prescribed to him,


and if Denny has a drug problem,
Doc should know about it.


If it was his dad or grandma, maybe
they gave it to him to help him sleep.


He doesn't seem like an addict.


You think he has a good reason
for having those pills?


He might. You'd have to ask.


You're right. Thanks.


- For what?
- Being such a good friend.


Hey, Ricky. How's it going?


Love sucks, Preach.


[knocking on door]


Come in. [clears throat]


Okay. If you're here
to read me the riot act, don't.


I know perfectly well what I did.


I just came by to say,
if you need anything, I'm here for you.


- God, I screwed up, Brie.
- Right.


Because you're human.


Why are you being so understanding?
I've been pretty tough on you.


Oof. I know. You gave me a free place
to live, you helped me get a job,


introduced me to your friends,
I can't believe we're still talking.


Well, you're family.
I'm always gonna look out for you.


It goes both ways.


How's Sugar? Have you been riding?


Few times, but it's hard.


I keep expecting my mom's
gonna walk out of the barn to greet us.


And that'll never happen again.


You've been so brave,
and taking care of Chloe...


I should be thanking Chloe.
She's the reason I get out of bed.


In fact, I should relieve the sitter.


Oh. Oh.


Thanks for coming over.
I didn't have it in me to face the farm.


I totally get it.


You know, it can be bittersweet,
but when I'm out there,


I feel like Mom's all around me.


Wish I had a place like that.


So make one.


Go somewhere you think
she'd have loved and make it your spot.


And do what?


[chuckles] Nothing.


Just reflect.


I'm not very good at sitting still.
Let alone being quiet.


Well, might be worth trying.
It's been really good for me.


- Thank you.
- Oh, sweetheart, thank you.


[on voicemail] You've reached Denny,
please leave a message.


Denny, Denny, it's Doc.


I was wondering
if you would stop by the clinic today.


There's something I want
to discuss with you, privately. Bye.


- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?


Ah.


I'm okay.


- Could have taken the day off.
- I know.


I just didn't want
to be alone with my thoughts.


Oh, I have been there, believe me.


- And you and Jack have a lot going on.
- Yeah, we do.


[phone ringing]


Look, I'm not making an excuse
for what Jack did, but, uh...


The veteran's experience
is uniquely complex.


- [phone chimes, buzzes]
- I know.


I know, I just...
I don't know how he'll get out


of this destructive cycle
if he won't get help.


It's the fear.


The fear of reliving the pain...


that trumps reason.


Maybe this will clarify things. Uh...


January , ,
was one of the biggest campaigns


by the North Vietnamese
in the Vietnam w*r.


Took me years


before I could say
the phrase "Tet Offensive" out loud.


It was that bad.


Doc, I'm so sorry.


- I'm not telling you this for sympathy,
- [cell phone chimes]


I'm trying to explain how deep
some vets bury the trauma of w*r


in order to function day to day.


Not something I'm ever gonna understand.


I feel so helpless.


All I'm saying is don't give up on him.


What you guys have is...
Well, it's worth fighting for.


- [phone ringing]
- Yeah.


Well, someone is really trying
to get ahold of you.


It's Stacie, my sister-in-law.
She wants to have dinner tonight.


It's not like you to avoid someone.


I don't know if that's entirely true,
but I'm just exhausted.


And she is, uh... difficult.


I know it is your nature
to put others' needs above your own,


but give yourself a break on this one.


Just do what's best for you.


Yeah.


Hello, Daniel.


- It's Brady. Do I know you?
- We have not been formally introduced.


I'm Melissa.


- And?
- And this is my operation.


Well, it's a family business,
but I run the day-to-day.


That so?


And how do I know
you are who you are and not some cop?


Calvin promised you the keys
to the kingdom when he retired.


Is that right?


I also know
your collaboration with law enforcement


precipitated the raid on Emerald Lumber.


- That's not true.
- Cut the crap, Brady.


If there's one thing I cannot stomach,
it's a liar. Just ask Calvin.


- That's why he's been... demoted.
- So why are you still dealing with me?


Because you have collateral,
which I believe will keep you in line.


You're talking about the business?


Oh. I'm talking about
your girlfriend, Brie.


- Now, when the shipment arrives...
- Like I told Calvin...


I don't deal with the dr*gs.


Well, our night business
might spill into your day business.


So I'm gonna need you to cooperate.


Fine.


But just so you know...


if anything happens to Brie...


I'll burn this place down.


Ooh. Passionate.


I like that.


I'll be in touch.


I went to the clerk's office
to check for small water sources.


But when I pulled up a topography map,
I found an inconsistency.


On a current map,
you won't find any water sources


near Shelter Mountain,
but an older map clearly shows a reservoir


- just east of the lower bridge.
- [phone ringing]


- Where's the map?
- In my car.


- Okay. Sounds good. I'll go check it out.
- Well, we'll go.


- I found the map. I'm going with you.
- No. Brie, it...


It's not safe. Calvin's probably armed.


I've gotten this far.
I'm not just gonna walk away now.


Okay.


Fine, but I'm calling for backup.


And if anything goes down,
you follow my orders.


For example?


If I say "run"...


you run.


Didn't want to startle you.


Come in. Sit down.


Sorry it took me so long to get here.


- I was hiking.
- It's okay.


- So you wanted to see me.
- Yes.


No easy way to say this,
so I'll just be direct.


It has come to my attention
you have a bottle of Klonopin


that is not in your name.
And in addition to that,


I suspect you went through
the clinic's financial files,


which are highly confidential.


And after the incident
with the drug cabinet...


I gotta think to myself
there's something seriously wrong here.


I did go through the clinic's financials
without permission.


Why? Why would you do that?


When my dad passed away...


I got a big insurance payout.


It's a lot of money.
I wanna use it for something good.


Something that'll help people
and live on in his memory.


I'm not following you here.


I used the funds
to pay off the clinic's mortgage.


Thought it'd be cool if you received
a zero-balance mortgage statement.


Wow, I...


I don't know what to say,
except thank you.


That is extremely generous.


You and your practice help so many people.
This is what my dad would've wanted.


I'm glad you think so.


But I still gotta ask,
what about the prescription?


Now, if I tell you, you're gonna look
at me differently, and I...


- I don't know if I can stand that.
- I have trusted you so far.


It's time you gave me
the benefit of the doubt.


And you promise you won't tell anyone?
Even if you think you're trying to help.


I give you my word.


Muriel.


If you're trying
to get me to like you, you're winning.

- Stacie?

I...

- Well, I'm here for Mark.


If you needed something,
he would have shown up, so...


Oh.


Yeah.


Mel, I know that I have been...


I've been terrible to you.


Yeah, that reminds me, I, uh...


I got your sonogram.


Oh, I'm so sorry. I...


I shouldn't have sent that.


It was insensitive.


I also apologize
for asking for your wedding ring.


It was totally inappropriate.


Oh.


Uh, wow. Okay.


Um...


- Thank you. Thank you for apologizing.
- I really mean it.


I believe you.


Yeah, we're really excited.


Just having a hard time
with knowing that my daughter


is never gonna meet her uncle Mark.


I'm sure it's hard
not being able to share this with him.


Yeah, it is.


Mel, Mark loved you so much.


And you knew him better
than anybody, so I was thinking


if we work together, we could help
keep Mark's memory alive for my daughter.


Yeah, that would be nice.


I'm glad that you called.


Actually, nobody knows this yet,
but we're gonna name her Monroe for Mark.


Oh, Stacie.


Mark would be thrilled.


Are you really that mad at me?


What now?


Well, my aunt from Portland
is throwing a baby shower for Todd and I,


and we sent out the invitations last week


and I haven't gotten a response
from you or Mel.


- We didn't get an invitation.
- Well, I'm positive I sent it.


It didn't arrive.


Okay. Well, um...


all the information's in here.


The club had a cancellation,


so we're having it there
instead of the B and B.


Uh, there's gonna be a chocolate fountain


and Todd's buying
a case of Dom for the toast.


- Sounds fancy.
- You're gonna be there, right?


- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
- You were so pissed at me


for not telling you the twins were boys.


And one of the things I respect most
about you is that you're honest.


Even when it's something
I don't wanna hear.


- There were plenty of those.
- There's plenty of those.


But I learned that I can depend on you.


That's all I really want for the twins,
is parents they can trust.


- Because I never really had that.
- I know.


Thank you.


You know, Char,
our boys are gonna have two parents


that love
and support them unconditionally.


Yeah.


That's better than either of us had.


- You should feel good about that.
- I do. Yeah.


But there is one thing
that's kind of been bugging me.


What's that?


Why didn't you tell me
you and Mel are getting married?


Huh?


I saw Mel at a store
buying a wedding dress.


No, no, her sister got married.


Oh.


So she was telling the truth.


- Well, why wouldn't she?
- I don't know. To protect my feelings.


Charmaine,
we just said I've been straight with you.


- Yeah.
- All right? So is Mel.


So going forward, you never have to worry
about being lied to, okay?


Hey, Jack,
Barry Martinez is here to see you.


[Jack] Thanks.


I gotta go, but we'll talk at the shower.


- Okay. Thanks. Yeah.
- Thanks for the invite.


Hey. Jack Sheridan. Thanks for coming.


Barry. Glad you called.


Yeah.


Uh, why don't we speak in my office?


So Preacher said
that you were in the Corps.


Yeah. Third Battalion, First Marines.


Oh, Thundering Third.


You guys were some of the first Marines
to get into Iraq, right?


Mm-hm.


- So you were there for...
- Phantom Fury, yeah.


Yep. It was as bad as advertised.


So how did you get into this?


Well, over Marines from my battalion
have committed su1c1de since .


That's more
than we lost the entire operation.


So I figured
if I can help just one soldier...


it would honor the ones
who didn't make it home.


- That's pretty noble.
- Not really. It's...


It's what helped me recover.


What can I do for you?


Uh, I don't know.
Probably nothing. I mean, I...


Just things haven't really, um...


been going so well.


- Have you tried therapy in the past?
- No. No, I kind of try to rely on myself


- to solve my problems.
- [chuckles] Right.


The best thing to do
is you take whatever's broken apart...


and you put it back together
piece by piece.


That way, you can be sure
you found the source of the problem.


Okay.


And how long does that take?


No, if it's done correctly,
there is no timeline.


Hey. Up for a visitor?


Come in.


Would you like to sit down?


Yeah, sure.


Uh...


So, um...


I... Like, I didn't know if I should call.


I want to apologize.


I know it seems like
I've been sending you mixed messages.


That was never my intent.


It's just that
when you started asking me those questions


about Christopher, Paige...


I didn't know how to answer them.


It's, um...


It's not my story to tell.


Mm.


That's very cryptic, don't you think?


Bottom line is that Paige and I...


we're not together.


Thank you for clarifying that.


[both chuckle]


Still, I am not a clean slate.


Now, if you don't wanna deal with me,
you know, I get it. I've got baggage.


We all do.


Truth is,
neither of us are fortune tellers.


Instead, all I can do
is be as honest as possible.


Well, if we are laying our cards
on the table...


I have feelings for you.


- And I think you have feelings for me too?
- I do.


Your smile,
it knocks me out every single time.


So for right now,
that is all I need to know.


Thanks again for seeing me and just
for being so awesome about everything.


Oh, my gosh, of course.
I can't wait to meet Monroe,


and if you ever need a break,
just let me know and I'll fly down.


Oh, I will take you up on that.


- No, it's my treat. It's my treat.
- No, no, no.


- We are celebrating you becoming a mother.
- Aw.


- Okay?
- Thank you.


- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.


Um, There's something I wanted
to tell you, but it's not really my place.


Okay. What?


Okay.


Mom hired a lawyer
to seek custody of your last two embryos.


What?


Mark told her
that you guys had two embryos left


and she got it in her head
that she could hire a surrogate


and raise Mark's kid.


I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that's just so insane.


- I don't even know what to say.
- I totally agree and I'm so sorry.


I didn't want you to be blindsided.


Mm. I gotta admit, this isn't exactly
how I imagined this day ending.


Mm-hm.


[phone ringing]


Let me turn this thing off.


- Can you just give me two minutes?
- I'm not going anywhere.


[chuckles]


Hello.


[Christopher] Preach.


- Christopher?
- I don't understand.


Uncle Vince is acting weird.


- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


Where are you?


- I don't know.
- Christopher,


this is important. You recognize anything
about where you are right now?


No. We've been driving around a lot,


- but Vince makes me hide in the backseat.
- Whose phone are you using?


Uncle Vince's.


- He let you have it?
- No.


Usually hides his phone at night,


- but he fell asleep and left it out.
- That's very brave of you.


I remembered your number from summer camp.


Good for you.


Preach...


I wanna come home.


I know, buddy.


We're gonna get you home.


You sure
there isn't anything you can tell me


about where you are?
Are you near the ocean?


- He's awake. I gotta go.
- Christopher...


Hey.


I'm gonna take a shower.


All right, can we please just talk first?


- We already talked.
- So you'd rather stay mad?


No. But there is nothing you could say
that's gonna make me feel better


- about what happened last night.
- I know, and that's why today,


I met with Preach's therapist.


- You saw a therapist?
- Yeah.


Barry, he's a Marine.


Okay.


- Why did you decide to call him?
- Because I agree with you.


I need help.


And I can't just keep telling you
that I'm gonna get my act together.


Okay.


How was it?


It was awkward as hell.


I agreed to do a few sessions with him.


Hey, Jack...


- if you're doing this for me...
- No.


I mean, you're part of the reason, but...


I'm tired of pretending everything's okay.


You taking this step means a lot to me.


I meant it when I said
everything's gonna get better, okay?


I really meant it.


Okay.


I was scared.
I thought something had happened to you.


I know, I know, I know,
and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know.


I love you.


- Sorry. I can't lose you. Okay?
- You're not going to. No.


Everything's gonna be okay, I promise.


I promise you.


Listen, um...


I have to tell you,
I went and had dinner with Stacie.


- How did that go?
- She told me that Mark's mom, Cassandra...


- wants custody of my embryos.
- Oh, come on. Is that even a thing?


[scoffs] No, but, I mean,
anybody can file a lawsuit.


- But what...? What about...?
- No, she doesn't know I'm pregnant.


So if she finds out,
she's gonna want custody of the baby?


I don't know.


If it turns out to be Mark's baby...


Think she'd go through
with something like that?


I don't know.
But when Cassandra wants something,


she will do anything she can to get it.


- Here it is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll wait for backup.


- Well, where are they?
- I gave out the coordinates.


Should be here any minute.


I don't see anyone.


Hey, look.


Is that Calvin?


Yeah.


Howard, where the hell's backup?
Got eyes on Calvin.


[Howard] We're closing in now.
Do not engage. I repeat, do not engage.


Crap. He knows we're here.


He's getting aw...
