I heard you have been going fishing


with Uk these days.


That is true.


It is so boring to fish alone.


You once said that


Uk shares the same fate


as Master Seo Gyeong.


Is that why you are encouraging


and guiding him?


I am not the one guiding him.


Then is there someone else?


Who is it?


Do you know who that person is?


No one is teaching Uk


how to do spells right now.


I can be sure of it.


It was confirmed by his maid


who is always by his side.


Are you saying he progressed


that much single-handedly?


He may have become a mage of Jeongjingak


thanks to his schemes and good luck.


But he has no skills.


I am sure you have heard


of our ongoing bet.


He has yet to win once.


You are right.


If he had a master, his master would have


prevented him from being humiliated.


Reading Words of the Heart


had won him respect.


But our bet has humiliated him.


Seeing how he has not given up,


that object


must mean a lot to him.


Are you all right? Can you see?


Yes. And you, Young Master?


Did you get hurt anywhere?


You are right.


I did not know


how important this was to him.


Once Uk returns,


Beom would want to have


their duel right away.


But he is busy fishing right now?


And Mu-deok is letting him do that?


Gosh.


I doubt she would have let him.


So you can also see


that Uk listens to Mu-deok.


He is stubborn about things


no matter what others tell him.


But he always listens to Mu-deok.


We can also protect


the monsters from this world.


The monster


he was talking about was Naksu.


If he is looking for


the ice stone to protect her…


-They must not be together.


-What?


Why not?


Do you not like that they are close?


I do not.


If they end up going down the wrong path,


there will be nothing I can do.


Uk is someone who can potentially


bring chaos to the world.


What if we support and raise him


into an uncontrollable individual


and he becomes the center


of the world's attention?


Are you afraid that he will desire


to become king according to his fate


and bring chaos to Daeho?


It may be possible


if he learns of the King's Star.


It will forever broaden his horizons


and desire to achieve greatness.


Jin.


How long did it take you to reach Chisu?


Chisu?


It did not take me long to reach Ryusu,


but it did take some time to reach Chisu.


It took me three years


to look into the sky's energy,


three years to read the land's energy,


and four years to feel


the energy around me.


The energy from the sky and land,


and water that bridges between them.


It took me ten years to master them all


and reach Chisu.


That is incredible.


It took me 13 years.


And it took Yeom twice as long.


I was the second fastest after Jang g*ng.


But you see…


We say this energy flows


between heaven and earth.


But in fact, this is just water.


It took us over ten years


to finally grasp this energy.


But there are those


who can do that from birth.


Simply put, they are geniuses.


But to the world,


they seem reckless, unreliable,


and even dangerous at times.


Did I just


reach Chisu?


That is because


they are different from the rest of us.


Some could be jealous of them.


While others could be worried about them.


I will definitely win tomorrow.


I caught it.


Really?


Uk.


You have reached Chisu.


We react that way because we do not know


how they will use their terrifying powers.


Will he save this world


like Master Seo Gyeong did?


Or will he do the very opposite?


We do not know.


So are you saying


that you will continue to watch him?


Do not worry. I am debating as well.


If we need to get rid of that power,


I will do so with my own hands.


Uk, is your probation period over?


That is why I am back.


So you destroyed Cheonbugwan?


Do not exaggerate.


-Hey.


-You are finally back.


I am your final opponent.


-I see.


-I feel bad that


you will not be able to win


since I happen to be your last opponent.


You are right.


I hope the finale will not be boring.


I am counting on you.


What was that?


Did he undergo a new kind of training?


I heard he only went fishing.


Do not worry. He is just talking big.


I will humiliate him


in front of the Crown Prince today.


Your Royal Highness.


My foolish young master


lost nine duels so far


and thus made you lose


nine precious gold toads.


I do not deserve to look you in the eye.


Is there one duel left?


He trained hard,


so he will not disappoint you


this time around.


If I am not to be disappointed,


he should lose again.


You took me for a fool.


You were using my gold


to train your young master.


Thanks to the duels,


you had the satisfaction of watching


my young master get humiliated.


I believe that alone was worth the gold.


Yes, they were entertaining.


I hope he will lose this time again


so I can see you cry


after losing this to me.


Uk has the other half, does he not?


Since he had given this to you,


was this a symbol of love?


Did you give this up so you could use me?


If Uk loses and this becomes mine,


I will destroy it.


You must lose something as well.


What a pity.


Your heartwrenching love


will be thrown away.


Do as you please.


That jade did its job


by allowing my young master


to have ten duels.


Did you not say that


this was precious enough to bet your life?


If he and I shared feelings


worth betting my life on,


losing that would not affect


the feelings we have toward each other.


So you really do not care


if you lose this?


Fine.


Then I will throw this away.


So it really meant nothing to you.


Then you have deceived me.


You had said


it was your most precious belonging.


But if you do not care about it,


that means you have lied.


How will you pay for what you have done?


You said you have bet your life?


Fine.


This time, place yourself for the bet.


I already lost nine gold toads.


I do not wish to lose another.


The reward for this next duel


will be you.


Do as you please.


If Jang Uk loses,


you will be serving whoever beats him.


Yes, Your Royal Highness.


I will keep that in mind.


So you are Uk's last opponent?


I am Cha Beom.


I will defeat him no matter what.


You must win this duel.


If you fail,


I will see to it


that you never succeed in life as a mage.


Can you give me your word?


There are always variables in every duel…


Forget it!


I only need those


who will definitely win the duel.


Give me your word.


I am afraid I cannot do that,


Your Royal Highness.


No one expected him…


to defeat you either.


There is only one person who can b*at him


at all costs.


It is Seo Yul.


Seo Yul.


The bet started as nothing serious.


But I am beyond annoyed at this point.


I spent nine gold toads


just to put that arrogant Uk in his place.


Imagine how ridiculous I will look


if he happens to win the final match


due to some bizarre reason.


So I need someone


who can b*at him for certain.


As the best mage of Jeongjingak


and my cousin,


I believe you are the only one.


I know you two are very close.


But as the Crown Prince and your cousin,


could you help me out this once?


Yes, Your Royal Highness.


Really?


You will fight Uk for me?


I will win.


I give you my word.


That is right.


You of all people can do that.


Did Mu-deok really promise to serve


whoever b*at Uk?


Yes. Instead of the gold toad…


She decided to put herself as the bet.


Then I will b*at Uk


and take her in as my maid.


All right, then.


The person fighting Jang Uk


for his last duel. Step forward.


Uk.


The person you will be fighting against


is me.


Yul could not have volunteered


just so he could let Uk win, right?


No way.


When Dang-gu volunteered,


Uk refused to fight him.


He will not let Uk win.


He gave the Crown Prince his word


and said he would b*at Uk.


You may begin.


Yul was right.


Uk has greatly improved.


That is my shield spell.


When did he master that?


He just picked them up


through his previous duels.


Did he master all of his opponents' spells


from his previous nine duels?


He has learned and is mimicking


some spells from his previous duels.


He did it.


The duel has ended.


Seo Yul has won.


I knew it.


Uk lost all ten duels.


How did he use Tansu at the end?


He collected the energy in the air


and turned it into water.


That is absurd.


Only those


who have reached Chisu can do that.


When did you reach Chisu?


I told you yesterday that


I had something surprising to tell you.


That is incredible.


Congratulations.


Uk!


You have reached Chisu.


Congratulations, my friend!


Did you see that?


Our fellow mage, Jang Uk,


has reached Chisu!


-Really?


-Hey.


-Congratulations.


-Congratulations.


-You are amazing.


-Congratulations!


Hey!


Let us head to Sejukwon.


Mu-deok just left with the Crown Prince.


They are probably


putting an end to their bet.


I am just worried they may be


up to something ridiculous again.


I will go and check.


Yes. You should take care of her.


After all, you are now her owner.


That is what we want


the Crown Prince to think.


So Yul can go to see Mu-deok.


Uk, come with me to Sejukwon.


Let us go. Hurry.


-Be careful. Come on.


-That hurts.


Watch out.


Like you said, my young master


was defeated ten times.


You have won, Your Royal Highness.


You already knew


that he had reached Chisu.


That is why you did not hesitate


to place yourself as the bet.


Had Master Cha Beom competed


like he was supposed to,


my young master would have won.


He is no longer your young master.


You will be serving Yul from now on.


You said you two shared


quite intimate feelings.


All right.


I hope you continue doing that


while serving a new owner.


That is ridiculous.


How could he have reached Chisu already?


It is true. We all witnessed it.


Is this true?


My goodness!


He is truly incredible!


Uk, look at you!


-That hurts!


-Sorry!


Master Heo, I am in pain.


You stepped up because you were worried


that I might have to serve


Master Cha Beom, right?


Thank you so much for your kindness.


You will be serving me from now on.


That was a promise


I had made for the duel.


I need to pretend


to keep up with my promise.


Of course.


Feel free to let me know


if you need me to run any errands.


I will not need anything from you.


You can visit Uk whenever you want.


However,


there is one thing I ask of you.


Once I complete my training here


and return to Seoho Fortress,


there is someone


I would like to take with me.


Please help me


do that.


I did not know you had someone like that.


Give me your word.


Promise that you will help me.


You are asking me this favor as my owner.


I will do so at all costs.


There is a soul shifter


in Sejukwon right now.


So how could you bring Uk here?


What could I have done? He was hurt.


I told him to rest up for a few days.


-Is he badly hurt?


-No.


It is nothing serious.


How reckless of him to fight against Yul.


We should have just let him


keep fishing with Master Lee.


We should not have summoned him.


They must have done


more than just fishing.


Uk reached Chisu.


What?


Is that not incredible?


How unbelievable.


He is indeed extraordinary.


What have you been learning


while fishing


with Master Lee?


I learned how to catch a Golden Fish.


So he was determined


to help you reach Chisu.


-Has he taken you in as his pupil?


-No, Master Heo.


There is a reason


why he is taking care of me.


And what could that be?


Was there something


that…


he told you about?


It was regarding a family matter.


I caught onto it and asked him first.


It seems like you are already aware of it.


I had hoped…


you would not find out.


No.


It was not something I could turn


a blind eye to upon finding out.


What will you do?


About Maidservant Kim.


What about her?


Master Lee is trying to win


Maidservant Kim over


by treating me well.


So what will you do?


I mean, Master Lee is a wonderful man


who has helped me greatly.


But still…


I thought I should give you


the opportunity first,


given our history together.


What opportunity?


Did you know that Master Lee


has recently been staying at our house?


I was wondering where he was staying.


So he has been staying at your house.


Yes.


Since I am away, they must be enjoying


a lovely meal together.


Since she has a soft heart,


she loves providing for


and feeding others.


It is only a matter of time


until she falls for him.


I truly hope


she can marry a loving man.


If it is fine with you,


I would like to root for them.


Master Lee is unbelievably older than her.


But on the outside,


he looks younger than you.


It is still absurd.


He practices chastity while training.


How could they get married?


I had cut off my libido to train,


but I have since recovered.


It is not impossible.


Marriage should be consensual.


She needs to want it as well.


She has been in love


with a certain individual


for all these years.


Jin.


Do you really think


she is still in love with Jang g*ng?


I know her the best.


So please do not assume things.


Goodness.


You call others slow-witted


when you are the slow one.


You know nothing!


It has been ages


since she stopped loving Jang g*ng.


He was here


last time as well.


It is freshly-made quince tea.


It is fragrant.


Is it not good to keep


withered flowers at home.


It is not easy to find flowers


since it is colder now.


But I should listen to you


and throw them out.


I liked how the flowers


kept me company.


I completely forgot about the cups


and only brought the kettle.


How did they come back to life?


Was it Master Lee?


How beautiful.


He must have been


the one who gave her


those wildflowers too.


You are truly kind and warmhearted.


Am I?


Feel free to stay here


as long as you want.


I will cater to you as best as I can.


Thank you.


Was she Jang g*ng's wife?


Yes. She is very beautiful, is she not?


She must be the woman Jin


was head over heels with as Yeom said.


She has not withered away


and is still just as beautiful.


Perhaps that is why


he still cannot forget her.


Or perhaps,


he just does not like me.


I do not know.


I understand it was


the Crown Prince's command.


But how could he forbid me


from visiting Mu-deok?


She must be worried sick about me.


I am sure she is just busy.


I told her you were doing fine.


No.


Do you think


she would be relieved after hearing that?


She needs to see me in person.


Come here.


Seeing her will only hurt you.


I use this homing bird


to send letters to Seoho Fortress.


It would take three to four days


for a horse to arrive there.


Does this bird really fly that far?


How incredible.


Do you have the whistle I gave you?


I am sorry. I do not carry it with me.


It was given to you


by the person you are in love with.


I am hurt.


The homing bird will return


after two long blows on this whistle.


You seemed to be good at this.


Give it a try.


There.


The bird has returned.


Now, do two short ones.


I only said that to put him at ease.


He was worried that his pet bird


might have suffered during the winter,


so I told him that.


See? Mu-deok is doing well.


Wait. Uk.


What exactly did the Crown Prince


and Mu-deok bet on?


The thing you wanted to get.


It does not matter.


I cannot get it now since I lost.


But how could she look


so nonchalant after losing it?


-So what was it?


-Do not ask.


Why have you not once visited Uk


in Sejukwon?


There is no need to mind me


just because I am your new owner.


That is not why.


I am just trying not to be shameless.


So you really do not care


if you lose this?


I must find it.


I need to find it by tonight.


Only then can I see him without shame.


I knew it.


Uk has cut off his libido.


He dishonored the mages and ran away.


It was odd how he improved so quickly


and b*at the Crown Prince.


He chose to become Master Lee's pupil


and has practiced chastity.


Did you all see Master Lee?


He was Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,


and Master Heo was his pupil.


But he looks younger than our leader.


That is because he practiced chastity.


I heard he does not age because he reached


a high degree at such a young age.


Really? I heard he became young again


thanks to a spell.


A spell?


Whatever the case may be,


Uk sure is determined.


So what if he has reached Chisu?


If it were me,


I would have never practiced chastity.


Of course not. Me neither.


-He is so persistent.


-Tell me about it.


They are just jealous.


Young Master Jang is subjected


to all sorts of horrible rumors.


I was able


to get some much-needed sleep lately


thanks to her medicine.


I am glad


that your herbal medicine is effective.


I used the valerian that I got


from the wetlands of Wol Fortress.


It is known for its calming effect.


It must have helped you relax


and fall asleep better.


I can see why Master Heo recommended you.


Thankfully, I am now able


to get some sleep.


But the ringing in my ears


and the splitting headache still remain.


They have worsened


after the news of the soul shifter


surprised you last month.


A soul shifter tried to enter the palace.


There could easily be one in here already.


Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu


strengthened the security,


so do not worry.


The soul shifter who tried to enter


the palace was one of his men.


There were also rumors


about a soul shifter


being spotted in Cheonbugwan.


I cannot trust anyone.


It seems like your anxiety


stems from your heart, Your Majesty.


What do you think about finding


an alternative way to calm yourself?


Do you know Hemp Master Lee?


The last pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.


I have heard of him


but only saw him once in Songrim.


My grandfather was his pupil,


so I have heard stories about him.


He may be able to relieve your anxiety.


Are you saying he can tell


if there is a soul shifter around me?


I do not know him that well


since I have not met him.


Perhaps you could invite him


to your palace and ask for his help.


I told you to clean her room every day!


How could you let the water


in this vase rot?


I am sorry, my lady!


Imagine if Bu-yeon returned


and saw this vase full of stagnant water.


She would be disappointed in me.


Change the bedsheets,


and get rid of that!


She cannot see,


so why would you place that there


and run the risk of her tripping?


Dozens of girls have come,


but none of them were Bu-yeon.


Being disappointed over and over again


must have made Mother easily distressed.


I agree.


But it will be your birthday soon.


-Here.


-What is this?


Father, they are so pretty.


But it is not my birthday yet.


I will get you


something prettier on your birthday.


I will try it on right now.


Please put it on for me.


Sure.


Let me see how pretty you are.


You always used to braid my hair


back when I was little.


Mother never did that.


I am sorry. Did that hurt a lot?


I am fine.


I must have lost my touch


since it had been a while.


I am sorry.


That is all right. Do I look pretty?


You are always beautiful.


Park Jin sh*t me with this bow.


I was defeated that day.


I cannot give any excuses


or take back the outcome of a fight.


But once I regain my strength,


I would like to have


a proper fight with him.


What are you doing?


I am cleaning, my lord.


Be careful what you touch.


Touch a w*apon filled with the energy


of a high-degree mage,


and a girl like you could get hurt.


Even I am aware of that, my lord.


But I did wonder


why you would place this here


when I have to clean the desk.


I usually hang it up well.


I simply forgot.


But you are still young.


I cannot believe


you are already forgetful.


I am just worried as a member of Songrim.


What if you forget to pay me?


My lord.


Please be healthy. You are still young.


I will come back later to clean, my lord.


What a clever


and daring girl she is.


How did Mu-deok


and Uk first meet?


I do not know the details,


but I heard he paid her debt


and took her out of Chwiseonru.


Then go to Chwiseonru


and ask around about her.


Find out her background


and what kind of girl she is.


I am just curious that is all.


I do not know well either.


But the broker who brought her here


is in the capital at the moment.


I will tell him to go to Songrim.


Hey, you there.


We met in Sari Village, right?


What is it this time?


So-i.


Have you not seen her in the capital?


Do you know where she could be?


I do not know.


She is not a native of Sari Village.


She only stayed for a few months


and then stole the villagers' belongings.


Let me know if you catch her.


Where can I find her?


Darn it.


You have made some bad friends, So-i.


Could she have gone to find Mu-deok?


I will take you to Jinyowon soon.


But there is something


we need to take care of first.


Here. Eat this.


You took my purse, right?


Give me back my ring.


Are they the ones you met in the capital?


That is correct,


but why did you bring them here?


I love that you are persistent and smart.


But that is also what makes you dangerous.


There is something I want you to see.


Assistant Gwanju.


Thank you for feeding me.


Be afraid.


Betray me or get your cover blown,


and you will meet the same fate.


All right.


Tell me if there is anyone else


who will recognize you.


I must get rid of them.


Is there anyone else?


Yes, my lord.


Search thoroughly.


I definitely threw it in there.


I cannot find it.


Search over there.


I had searched that area thoroughly,


but there was nothing.


Look again.


I can barely see--


Yes, Your Royal Highness.


I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.


Yes, look over there.


What are you doing?


I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.


Yes, look over there.


What are you doing?


It is none of your business. Go on.


I am afraid Eunuch Oh


will needlessly suffer.


So I must say something. May I?


What is it?


Could you possibly


be looking


for this?


You found it?


I searched day and night


and found it not too long ago.


You threw it away.


Since I picked it up,


it is mine once again.


Goodness.


Eunuch Oh, you can stop and come out.


Yes, Your Royal Highness.


Darn it.


Thanks to you,


I retrieved something precious.


I owe this all to you,


Your Royal Highness.


That is right.


I did not destroy it


or throw it too far away.


You only found it


because I threw it nearby.


If I may dare to try to understand you,


could you be giving yourself credit


and being grumpy


because you feel bad?


As Filthy Mu-deok,


you ought to just listen to what I say.


How dare you try to understand me?


I apologize, Your Royal Highness.


Your Royal Highness.


Your Royal Highness.


Master Heo told me to tell you


that Master Lee is here.


All right. Is he at Sejukwon?


Yes, Your Royal Highness.


His pupil, Jang Uk, is with him.


It is said that Uk


made such sudden progress


thanks to Master Lee's bizarre training.


If that were not the case,


he would not have been able


to hold a candle to you.


Let us go.


You are now serving Seo Yul


instead of Jang Uk.


Had I competed and b*at Uk,


you would have served me instead.


Had you competed instead,


there would have been no chance


of you becoming my owner.


I would have let him win out of pity.


Do you not pity him?


Everyone in Songrim knows


that Uk is practicing chastity.


-Right?


-Do not feign ignorance.


You must know best.


Are you not the one who serves him


the chaste herb tea every day?


I have never done that.


How else did he reach Chisu so quickly?


He is not even Jang g*ng's real son.


His mother married into the Jang family


and gave birth to an illegitimate son.


Now, her son will end


his family's line for good.


His father blocked his gate of energy


so Uk would not carry on the family line.


But he managed to open it again,


so he should at least be chaste.


That is true.


You are obnoxious and despicable.


What?


What did you just say?


-You heard me.


-How dare you?


-Say it again.


-Then you will hit me.


Tell me this instant!


Tell them.


If they must hear it,


make sure you tell them loud and clear.


You are obnoxious and despicable!


That is what she said. Did you get that?


-Yes, Your Royal Highness.


-Yes, Your Royal Highness.


Mu-deok, I had given you something.


Show them.


I had bestowed that sachet to you.


If someone hits, swears,


or mistreats you while I am not around,


you must tell me.


Yes, Your Royal Highness.


You may go.


It is foolish of you to make an enemy


of someone so powerful out of jealousy.


You have ink on your shoulder.


You can erase that black ink


with white rice.


The two colors may contrast one another.


But mix them together,


and they will get rid of that stain.


Those were some wise words.


Where did you read that,


Your Royal Highness?


Somewhere.


It is something you may see


on a highly competitive exam.


Is my young master not here?


I heard you were injured.


Are you better now?


Yes, thanks to you.


Thank you for sending me the medicine.


Maidservant Kim invited me over


for dinner recently.


Can you join us?


Sure.


Then I will set a date and tell Mu-deok.


Do you know my maid?


There was a time


when I visited you but left


without being able to see you.


That day, she was in your room.


Do not go.


Do not go to your room and just stay here.


I will bring you your clothes.


What was that?


Was she making a move on me?


What do you mean?


It is nothing.


Wait.


Stay still.


It left.


-Did it?


-Yes.


-It has left.


-I was so startled.


Mu-deok.


Mu-deok, we meet again.


Take care of yourself.


I will see you at the palace.


Right.


What is it? Did you run here?


I did.


It took you long enough to visit me


after learning that I was hurt.


What is it?


What could be more shocking


than serving someone else?


It is not that.


The other mages were gossiping about you.


I wanted to know the truth.


I see. So you heard about it as well.


Why rush over


when you know it is not true?


Who knows? You even caught


a Golden Fish while I was away.


You could have become


Master Lee's pupil for all I know.


What? That is definitely not true.


Forget it.


I even suggested it to you.


I guess it cannot be helped.


How can I prove it to you?


You said it could not be helped.


See?


I am not a woman to you.


If you want to prove it,


go embrace that pretty lady.


Then should I really do it?


Yes. Do it.


You better not say otherwise.


Fine, do it!


You told me to att*ck


when my opponent least expects it.


I have followed your teachings, my master.


Fine. Well done. I am proud of you.


By the way,


I heard you ran into her


in my room last time.


What about it?


Is that why you stopped me from going?


Did that happen?


I do not remember.


Understanding you is much harder


than controlling


Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's energy.


You were pulling me in, were you not?


Master, I am going to the palace today.


The King invited Master Lee,


and I will be accompanying him.


I had wanted to see the Queen


once again and it worked out.


Be safe.


I will. I will tell you everything


once I return.


Uk.


I found this.


I just so happened to find it.


I thought I should tell you.


Go.


Why would the leader of Songrim


look for me?


-Do you remember Mu-deok?


-Yes.


He wants to know


about her time in Sari Village.


He could just ask her directly. Why me?


She is here.


She is not. She is in Songrim.


She is?


What could a blind girl be doing there?


Master Lee wanted you two and Jang Uk


to accompany him to the palace.


Uk too?


Is he all better now?


We need to leave right away. Get ready.


Please be careful at the palace.


The ice stone is there.


I am aware of that.


Since they are shamelessly hiding it,


I have decided to be brazen


as well and make my move.


The last time I was invited to the palace,


you were this little.


I remember enjoying the candies


you had brought from there.


By the way,


should you not prepare


a gift for His Majesty?


I have prepared one already.


Yeom.


Send the gift over to the palace on time.


Yes, master.


Was it between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.?


Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., you fool.


Right. I am sorry.


Write it down so you will not forget.


You used to be easily distracted.


Now that you have aged,


you have become forgetful as well.


Let us go.


-Goodbye, master.


-Goodbye, master.


I just cannot get used to seeing that.


Mu-deok.


The leader would like to see you.


The leader?


Mu-deok.


Everything about you


has been exposed by this man over here.


I told him about your eyes.


Will my cover get blown?


My lord, you see…


She was not the only one who lied.


Her grandmother begged me,


so I played along with it.


Her family has always been poor.


She lied about being blind


to avoid getting sold off to pay the debt.


It is something like


those who pretend to limp


to avoid fighting at w*r.


Why did you lie about being blind


when you were sold off to Chwiseonru?


She was planning to run away.


Sure, she was sold off due to the debt.


But it would have been easier


to run away if she pretended to be blind.


-Right?


-That is correct.


I was on the run


when I first met Young Master Jang.


He took pity and took me in.


I am sorry for lying, my lord.


What I did was wrong.


Other than lying about that,


she has never done anything wrong.


She has always been


a great granddaughter and a kind girl.


Why did you lie for me?


I just did my money's worth.


Your money's worth?


But are you really not blind?


But then again,


I did find it odd from the beginning.


-What?


-Despite being blind,


you always recognized


whoever was in front of you.


You even knew


whether it would snow or rain.


Many villagers thought


you were lying about being blind.


They were creeped out and avoided you.


-I see.


-Anyway,


come to the ferry inn


if you ever need my help again.


All right?


Right.


Did you meet with So-i?


So-i?


She is in the capital right now.


Some thugs were looking for her.


I wonder what she did this time.


She was the one who robbed your house


after your grandmother passed away.


Do not get involved with her.


It seems you are also hiding things


Songrim does not know.


You said you did your money's worth.


Who paid you?


Ju-wol.


You do not need to thank me.


It was Young Master Jang's money.


If anyone asks or seeks Mu-deok,


use this money.


And of course, half of it is yours.


I was not hiding something heinous either.


I got my share as well.


And I like you.


I am truly grateful.


So what really happened to your eyes?


Forget it.


You must have your reasons.


Had Uk not taken any measures beforehand,


Park Jin would have found out.


If I get caught,


I will be putting Uk in danger as well.


Welcome, Master Lee Cheol.


I am grateful


for your invitation, Your Majesty.


Did that wench Shaman Choi


tell you to k*ll me?


Shaman Choi.


Could that be who the Queen really is?


Mu-deok.


That So-i you were talking about.


It could have been her who came by


looking for you a few days ago.


I heard she was dangerous, so be careful.


I will not be able to recognize her


since I do not know her face.


Should I have asked that man for details?


Come to the ferry inn


if you ever need my help again.


Ferry inn.


Everything about you


has been exposed by this man over here.


Is Broker Kim from Sari Village here?


Yes, he just arrived.


He is in the last room


on the second floor.


Mister, it is me, Mu-deok.


Mister.


Master Lee.


If you were Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,


you must be well over a century old.


So how do you maintain


such a youthful appearance?


How old do I look, Your Majesty?


You look like


you are in your mid-thirties.


At most, forty years old.


You are right. That is my biological age.


What?


My soul is over a century old.


My body from birth


had turned into ashes long ago.


This body did not originally belong to me.


Wait.


Does that mean you have switched bodies?


That is correct.


I am a soul shifter.


Your Majesty.


Did you not summon me today


to find the soul shifter?


I will do just that.


I can recognize soul shifters.


He knew from the beginning


that Mu-deok was a soul shifter.


You must be the one


who k*lled him.


Subtitle translation by: Soo-ji Kim


ALCHEMY OF SOULS


What were all those bodies?


What kind of life has Mu-deok led?


Mu-deok is hiding something


-that must not be revealed.


-My goodness!


Instead, it will let you know by barking.


As expected, there are


more soul shifters within the palace.


If it is revealed that King's Star


was created by sorcery,


it will spell the end of Songrim.


It is dangerous.


You may not know her,


but she knows who Mu-deok is.


We need Jang g*ng.


We will have to wait


until he returns of his own accord.


Mu-deok, what are you doing here?


I cannot leave Young Master Jang.


Keep loving me to death.
