﻿I heard you have been going fishing


with Uk these days.


That is true.


It is so boring to fish alone.


You once said that


Uk shares the same fate


as Master Seo Gyeong.


Is that why you are encouraging


and guiding him?


I am not the one guiding him.


Then is there someone else?


Who is it?


Do you know who that person is?


No one is teaching Uk


how to do spells right now.


I can be sure of it.


It was confirmed by his maid


who is always by his side.


Are you saying he progressed


that much single-handedly?


He may have become a mage of Jeongjingak


thanks to his schemes and good luck.


But he has no skills.


I am sure you have heard


of our ongoing bet.


He has yet to win once.


You are right.


If he had a master, his master would have


prevented him from being humiliated.


Reading Words of the Heart


had won him respect.


But our bet has humiliated him.


Seeing how he has not given up,


that object


must mean a lot to him.


Are you all right? Can you see?


Yes. And you, Young Master?


Did you get hurt anywhere?


You are right.


I did not know


how important this was to him.


Once Uk returns,


Beom would want to have


their duel right away.


But he is busy fishing right now?


And Mu-deok is letting him do that?


Gosh.


I doubt she would have let him.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you can also see


that Uk listens to Mu-deok.


He is stubborn about things


no matter what others tell him.


But he always listens to Mu-deok.


We can also protect


the monsters from this world.


The monster


he was talking about was Naksu.


If he is looking for


the ice stone to protect her…


-They must not be together.


-What?


Why not?


Do you not like that they are close?


I do not.


If they end up going down the wrong path,


there will be nothing I can do.


Uk is someone who can potentially


bring chaos to the world.


What if we support and raise him


into an uncontrollable individual


and he becomes the center


of the world's attention?


Are you afraid that he will desire


to become king according to his fate


and bring chaos to Daeho?


It may be possible


if he learns of the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">King</span>'s <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Star</span>.


It will forever broaden his horizons


and desire to achieve greatness.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span>.


How long did it take you to reach Chisu?


Chisu?


It did not take me long to reach Ryusu,


but it did take some time to reach Chisu.


It took me three years


to look into the sky's energy,


three years to read the land's energy,


and four years to feel


the energy around me.


The energy from the sky and land,


and water that bridges between them.


It took me ten years to master them all


and reach Chisu.


That is incredible.


It took me 13 years.


And it took Yeom twice as long.


I was the second fastest after Jang g*ng.


But you see…


We say this energy flows


between heaven and earth.


But in fact, this is just water.


It took us over ten years


to finally grasp this energy.


But there are those


who can do that from birth.


Simply put, they are geniuses.


But to the world,


they seem reckless, unreliable,


and even dangerous at times.


Did I just


reach Chisu?


That is because


they are different from the rest of us.


Some could be jealous of them.


While others could be worried about them.


I will definitely win tomorrow.


I caught it.


Really?


Uk.


You have reached Chisu.


We react that way because we do not know


how they will use their terrifying powers.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> he save this world


like Master Seo Gyeong did?


Or will he do the very opposite?


We do not know.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> are you saying


that you will continue to watch him?


Do not worry. I am debating as well.


If we need to get rid of that power,


I will do so with my own hands.


Uk, is your probation period over?


That is why I am back.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you destroyed Cheonbugwan?


Do not exaggerate.


-Hey.


-You are finally back.


I am your final opponent.


-I see.


-I feel bad that


you will not be able to win


since I happen to be your last opponent.


You are right.


I hope the finale will not be boring.


I am counting on you.


What was that?


Did he undergo a new kind of training?


I heard he only went fishing.


Do not worry. He is just talking big.


I will humiliate him


in front of the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> today.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> foolish young master


lost nine duels so far


and thus made you lose


nine precious gold toads.


I do not deserve to look you in the eye.


Is there one duel left?


He trained hard,


so he will not disappoint you


this time around.


If I am not to be disappointed,


he should lose again.


You took me for a fool.


You were using my gold


to train your young master.


Thanks to the duels,


you had the satisfaction of watching


my young master get humiliated.


I believe that alone was worth the gold.


Yes, they were entertaining.


I hope he will lose this time again


so I can see you cry


after losing this to me.


Uk has the other half, does he not?


Since he had given this to you,


was this a symbol of love?


Did you give this up so you could use me?


If Uk loses and this becomes mine,


I will destroy it.


You must lose something as well.


What a pity.


Your heartwrenching love


will be thrown away.


Do as you please.


That jade did its job


by allowing my young master


to have ten duels.


Did you not say that


this was precious enough to bet your life?


If he and I shared feelings


worth betting my life on,


losing that would not affect


the feelings we have toward each other.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you really do not care


if you lose this?


Fine.


Then I will throw this away.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> it really meant nothing to you.


Then you have deceived me.


You had said


it was your most precious belonging.


But if you do not care about it,


that means you have lied.


How will you pay for what you have done?


You said you have bet your life?


Fine.


This time, place yourself for the bet.


I already lost nine gold toads.


I do not wish to lose another.


The reward for this next duel


will be you.


Do as you please.


If Jang Uk loses,


you will be serving whoever beats him.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


I will keep that in mind.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you are Uk's last opponent?


I am Cha Beom.


I will defeat him no matter what.


You must win this duel.


If you fail,


I will see to it


that you never succeed in life as a mage.


Can you give me your word?


There are always variables in every duel…


Forget it!


I only need those


who will definitely win the duel.


Give me your word.


I am afraid I cannot do that,


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


No one expected him…


to defeat you either.


There is only one person who can b*at him


at all costs.


It is Seo Yul.


Seo Yul.


The bet started as nothing serious.


But I am beyond annoyed at this point.


I spent nine gold toads


just to put that arrogant Uk in his place.


Imagine how ridiculous I will look


if he happens to win the final match


due to some bizarre reason.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I need someone


who can b*at him for certain.


As the best mage of Jeongjingak


and my cousin,


I believe you are the only one.


I know you two are very close.


But as the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> and your cousin,


could you help me out this once?


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Really?


You will fight Uk for me?


I will win.


I give you my word.


That is right.


You of all people can do that.


Did Mu-deok really promise to serve


whoever b*at Uk?


Yes. Instead of the gold toad…


She decided to put herself as the bet.


Then I will b*at Uk


and take her in as my maid.


All right, then.


The person fighting Jang Uk


for his last duel. Step forward.


Uk.


The person you will be fighting against


is me.


Yul could not have volunteered


just so he could let Uk win, right?


No way.


When Dang-gu volunteered,


Uk refused to fight him.


He will not let Uk win.


He gave the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> his word


and said he would b*at Uk.


You may begin.


Yul was right.


Uk has greatly improved.


That is my shield spell.


When did he master that?


He just picked them up


through his previous duels.


Did he master all of his opponents' spells


from his previous nine duels?


He has learned and is mimicking


some spells from his previous duels.


He did it.


The duel has ended.


Seo Yul has won.


I knew it.


Uk lost all ten duels.


How did he use Tansu at the end?


He collected the energy in the air


and turned it into water.


That is absurd.


Only those


who have reached Chisu can do that.


When did you reach Chisu?


I told you yesterday that


I had something surprising to tell you.


That is incredible.


Congratulations.


Uk!


You have reached Chisu.


Congratulations, my friend!


Did you see that?


Our fellow mage, Jang Uk,


has reached Chisu!


-Really?


-Hey.


-Congratulations.


-Congratulations.


-You are amazing.


-Congratulations!


Hey!


Let us head to Sejukwon.


Mu-deok just left with the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.


They are probably


putting an end to their bet.


I am just worried they may be


up to something ridiculous again.


I will go and check.


Yes. You should take care of her.


After all, you are now her owner.


That is what we want


the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> to think.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> Yul can go to see Mu-deok.


Uk, come with me to Sejukwon.


Let us go. Hurry.


-Be careful. Come on.


-That hurts.


Watch out.


Like you said, my young master


was defeated ten times.


You have won, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


You already knew


that he had reached Chisu.


That is why you did not hesitate


to place yourself as the bet.


Had Master Cha Beom competed


like he was supposed to,


my young master would have won.


He is no longer your young master.


You will be serving Yul from now on.


You said you two shared


quite intimate feelings.


All right.


I hope you continue doing that


while serving a new owner.


That is ridiculous.


How could he have reached Chisu already?


It is true. We all witnessed it.


Is this true?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness!


He is truly incredible!


Uk, look at you!


-That hurts!


-Sorry!


Master Heo, I am in pain.


You stepped up because you were worried


that I might have to serve


Master Cha Beom, right?


Thank you so much for your kindness.


You will be serving me from now on.


That was a promise


I had made for the duel.


I need to pretend


to keep up with my promise.


Of course.


Feel free to let me know


if you need me to run any errands.


I will not need anything from you.


You can visit Uk whenever you want.


However,


there is one thing I ask of you.


Once I complete my training here


and return to Seoho Fortress,


there is someone


I would like to take with me.


Please help me


do that.


I did not know you had someone like that.


Give me your word.


Promise that you will help me.


You are asking me this favor as my owner.


I will do so at all costs.


There is a soul shifter


in Sejukwon right now.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> how could you bring Uk here?


What could I have done? He was hurt.


I told him to rest up for a few days.


-Is he badly hurt?


-No.


It is nothing serious.


How reckless of him to fight against Yul.


We should have just let him


keep fishing with Master Lee.


We should not have summoned him.


They must have done


more than just fishing.


Uk reached Chisu.


What?


Is that not incredible?


How unbelievable.


He is indeed extraordinary.


What have you been learning


while fishing


with Master Lee?


I learned how to catch a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Golden</span> Fish.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> he was determined


to help you reach Chisu.


-Has he taken you in as his pupil?


-No, Master Heo.


There is a reason


why he is taking care of me.


And what could that be?


Was there something


that…


he told you about?


It was regarding a family matter.


I caught onto it and asked him first.


It seems like you are already aware of it.


I had hoped…


you would not find out.


No.


It was not something I could turn


a blind eye to upon finding out.


What will you do?


About Maidservant Kim.


What about her?


Master Lee is trying to win


Maidservant Kim over


by treating me well.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what will you do?


I mean, Master Lee is a wonderful man


who has helped me greatly.


But still…


I thought I should give you


the opportunity first,


given our history together.


What opportunity?


Did you know that Master Lee


has recently been staying at our house?


I was wondering where he was staying.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> he has been staying at your house.


Yes.


Since I am away, they must be enjoying


a lovely meal together.


Since she has a soft heart,


she loves providing for


and feeding others.


It is only a matter of time


until she falls for him.


I truly hope


she can marry a loving man.


If it is fine with you,


I would like to root for them.


Master Lee is unbelievably older than her.


But on the outside,


he looks younger than you.


It is still absurd.


He practices chastity while training.


How could they get married?


I had cut off my libido to train,


but I have since recovered.


It is not impossible.


Marriage should be consensual.


She needs to want it as well.


She has been in love


with a certain individual


for all these years.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span>.


Do you really think


she is still in love with Jang g*ng?


I know her the best.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> please do not assume things.


Goodness.


You call others slow-witted


when you are the slow one.


You know nothing!


It has been ages


since she stopped loving Jang g*ng.


He was here


last time as well.


It is freshly-made quince tea.


It is fragrant.


Is it not good to keep


withered flowers at home.


It is not easy to find flowers


since it is colder now.


But I should listen to you


and throw them out.


I liked how the flowers


kept me company.


I completely forgot about the cups


and only brought the kettle.


How did they come back to life?


Was it Master Lee?


How beautiful.


He must have been


the one who gave her


those wildflowers too.


You are truly kind and warmhearted.


Am I?


Feel free to stay here


as long as you want.


I will cater to you as best as I can.


Thank you.


Was she Jang g*ng's wife?


Yes. She is very beautiful, is she not?


She must be the woman <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span>


was head over heels with as Yeom said.


She has not withered away


and is still just as beautiful.


Perhaps that is why


he still cannot forget her.


Or perhaps,


he just does not like me.


I do not know.


I understand it was


the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>'s command.


But how could he forbid me


from visiting Mu-deok?


She must be worried sick about me.


I am sure she is just busy.


I told her you were doing fine.


No.


Do you think


she would be relieved after hearing that?


She needs to see me in person.


Come here.


Seeing her will only hurt you.


I use this homing bird


to send letters to Seoho Fortress.


It would take three to four days


for a horse to arrive there.


Does this bird really fly that far?


How incredible.


Do you have the whistle I gave you?


I am sorry. I do not carry it with me.


It was given to you


by the person you are in love with.


I am hurt.


The homing bird will return


after two long blows on this whistle.


You seemed to be good at this.


Give it a try.


There.


The bird has returned.


Now, do two short ones.


I only said that to put him at ease.


He was worried that his pet bird


might have suffered during the winter,


so I told him that.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>? Mu-deok is doing well.


Wait. Uk.


What exactly did the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>


and Mu-deok bet on?


The thing you wanted to get.


It does not matter.


I cannot get it now since I lost.


But how could she look


so nonchalant after losing it?


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what was it?


-Do not ask.


Why have you not once visited Uk


in Sejukwon?


There is no need to mind me


just because I am your new owner.


That is not why.


I am just trying not to be shameless.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you really do not care


if you lose this?


I must find it.


I need to find it by tonight.


Only then can I see him without shame.


I knew it.


Uk has cut off his libido.


He dishonored the mages and ran away.


It was odd how he improved so quickly


and b*at the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.


He chose to become Master Lee's pupil


and has practiced chastity.


Did you all see Master Lee?


He was Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,


and Master Heo was his pupil.


But he looks younger than our leader.


That is because he practiced chastity.


I heard he does not age because he reached


a high degree at such a young age.


Really? I heard he became young again


thanks to a spell.


A spell?


Whatever the case may be,


Uk sure is determined.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what if he has reached Chisu?


If it were me,


I would have never practiced chastity.


Of course not. Me neither.


-He is so persistent.


-Tell me about it.


They are just jealous.


Young Master Jang is subjected


to all sorts of horrible rumors.


I was able


to get some much-needed sleep lately


thanks to her medicine.


I am glad


that your herbal medicine is effective.


I used the valerian that I got


from the wetlands of Wol Fortress.


It is known for its calming effect.


It must have helped you relax


and fall asleep better.


I can see why Master Heo recommended you.


Thankfully, I am now able


to get some sleep.


But the ringing in my ears


and the splitting headache still remain.


They have worsened


after the news of the soul shifter


surprised you last month.


A soul shifter tried to enter the palace.


There could easily be one in here already.


Assistant Gwanju <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span> Mu


strengthened the security,


so do not worry.


The soul shifter who tried to enter


the palace was one of his men.


There were also rumors


about a soul shifter


being spotted in Cheonbugwan.


I cannot trust anyone.


It seems like your anxiety


stems from your heart, Your Majesty.


What do you think about finding


an alternative way to calm yourself?


Do you know Hemp Master Lee?


The last pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.


I have heard of him


but only saw him once in Songrim.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> grandfather was his pupil,


so I have heard stories about him.


He may be able to relieve your anxiety.


Are you saying he can tell


if there is a soul shifter around me?


I do not know him that well


since I have not met him.


Perhaps you could invite him


to your palace and ask for his help.


I told you to clean her room every day!


How could you let the water


in this vase rot?


I am sorry, my lady!


Imagine if Bu-yeon returned


and saw this vase full of stagnant water.


She would be disappointed in me.


Change the bedsheets,


and get rid of that!


She cannot see,


so why would you place that there


and run the risk of her tripping?


Dozens of girls have come,


but none of them were Bu-yeon.


Being disappointed over and over again


must have made Mother easily distressed.


I agree.


But it will be your birthday soon.


-Here.


-What is this?


Father, they are so pretty.


But it is not my birthday yet.


I will get you


something prettier on your birthday.


I will try it on right now.


Please put it on for me.


Sure.


Let me see how pretty you are.


You always used to braid my hair


back when I was little.


Mother never did that.


I am sorry. Did that hurt a lot?


I am fine.


I must have lost my touch


since it had been a while.


I am sorry.


That is all right. Do I look pretty?


You are always beautiful.


Park <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span> sh*t me with this bow.


I was defeated that day.


I cannot give any excuses


or take back the outcome of a fight.


But once I regain my strength,


I would like to have


a proper fight with him.


What are you doing?


I am cleaning, my lord.


Be careful what you touch.


Touch a w*apon filled with the energy


of a high-degree mage,


and a girl like you could get hurt.


Even I am aware of that, my lord.


But I did wonder


why you would place this here


when I have to clean the desk.


I usually hang it up well.


I simply forgot.


But you are still young.


I cannot believe


you are already forgetful.


I am just worried as a member of Songrim.


What if you forget to pay me?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lord.


Please be healthy. You are still young.


I will come back later to clean, my lord.


What a clever


and daring girl she is.


How did Mu-deok


and Uk first meet?


I do not know the details,


but I heard he paid her debt


and took her out of Chwiseonru.


Then go to Chwiseonru


and ask around about her.


Find out her background


and what kind of girl she is.


I am just curious that is all.


I do not know well either.


But the broker who brought her here


is in the capital at the moment.


I will tell him to go to Songrim.


Hey, you there.


We met in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village, right?


What is it this time?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i.


Have you not seen her in the capital?


Do you know where she could be?


I do not know.


She is not a native of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village.


She only stayed for a few months


and then stole the villagers' belongings.


Let me know if you catch her.


Where can I find her?


Darn it.


You have made some bad friends, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i.


Could she have gone to find Mu-deok?


I will take you to Jinyowon soon.


But there is something


we need to take care of first.


Here. Eat this.


You took my purse, right?


Give me back my ring.


Are they the ones you met in the capital?


That is correct,


but why did you bring them here?


I love that you are persistent and smart.


But that is also what makes you dangerous.


There is something I want you to see.


Assistant Gwanju.


Thank you for feeding me.


Be afraid.


Betray me or get your cover blown,


and you will meet the same fate.


All right.


Tell me if there is anyone else


who will recognize you.


I must get rid of them.


Is there anyone else?


Yes, my lord.


Search thoroughly.


I definitely threw it in there.


I cannot find it.


Search over there.


I had searched that area thoroughly,


but there was nothing.


Look again.


I can barely see--


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.


Yes, look over there.


What are you doing?


I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.


Yes, look over there.


What are you doing?


It is none of your business. Go on.


I am afraid Eunuch Oh


will needlessly suffer.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I must say something. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">May</span> I?


What is it?


Could you possibly


be looking


for this?


You found it?


I searched day and night


and found it not too long ago.


You threw it away.


Since I picked it up,


it is mine once again.


Goodness.


Eunuch Oh, you can stop and come out.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Darn it.


Thanks to you,


I retrieved something precious.


I owe this all to you,


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


That is right.


I did not destroy it


or throw it too far away.


You only found it


because I threw it nearby.


If I may dare to try to understand you,


could you be giving yourself credit


and being grumpy


because you feel bad?


As Filthy Mu-deok,


you ought to just listen to what I say.


How dare you try to understand me?


I apologize, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Master Heo told me to tell you


that Master Lee is here.


All right. Is he at Sejukwon?


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


His pupil, Jang Uk, is with him.


It is said that Uk


made such sudden progress


thanks to Master Lee's bizarre training.


If that were not the case,


he would not have been able


to hold a candle to you.


Let us go.


You are now serving Seo Yul


instead of Jang Uk.


Had I competed and b*at Uk,


you would have served me instead.


Had you competed instead,


there would have been no chance


of you becoming my owner.


I would have let him win out of pity.


Do you not pity him?


Everyone in Songrim knows


that Uk is practicing chastity.


-Right?


-Do not feign ignorance.


You must know best.


Are you not the one who serves him


the chaste herb tea every day?


I have never done that.


How else did he reach Chisu so quickly?


He is not even Jang g*ng's real son.


His mother married into the Jang family


and gave birth to an illegitimate son.


Now, her son will end


his family's line for good.


His father blocked his gate of energy


so Uk would not carry on the family line.


But he managed to open it again,


so he should at least be chaste.


That is true.


You are obnoxious and despicable.


What?


What did you just say?


-You heard me.


-How dare you?


-Say it again.


-Then you will hit me.


Tell me this instant!


Tell them.


If they must hear it,


make sure you tell them loud and clear.


You are obnoxious and despicable!


That is what she said. Did you get that?


-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Mu-deok, I had given you something.


Show them.


I had bestowed that sachet to you.


If someone hits, swears,


or mistreats you while I am not around,


you must tell me.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


You may go.


It is foolish of you to make an enemy


of someone so powerful out of jealousy.


You have ink on your shoulder.


You can erase that black ink


with white rice.


The two colors may contrast one another.


But mix them together,


and they will get rid of that stain.


Those were some wise words.


Where did you read that,


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness?


Somewhere.


It is something you may see


on a highly competitive exam.


Is my young master not here?


I heard you were injured.


Are you better now?


Yes, thanks to you.


Thank you for sending me the medicine.


Maidservant Kim invited me over


for dinner recently.


Can you join us?


Sure.


Then I will set a date and tell Mu-deok.


Do you know my maid?


There was a time


when I visited you but left


without being able to see you.


That day, she was in your room.


Do not go.


Do not go to your room and just stay here.


I will bring you your clothes.


What was that?


Was she making a move on me?


What do you mean?


It is nothing.


Wait.


Stay still.


It left.


-Did it?


-Yes.


-It has left.


-I was so startled.


Mu-deok.


Mu-deok, we meet again.


Take care of yourself.


I will see you at the palace.


Right.


What is it? Did you run here?


I did.


It took you long enough to visit me


after learning that I was hurt.


What is it?


What could be more shocking


than serving someone else?


It is not that.


The other mages were gossiping about you.


I wanted to know the truth.


I see. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you heard about it as well.


Why rush over


when you know it is not true?


Who knows? You even caught


a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Golden</span> Fish while I was away.


You could have become


Master Lee's pupil for all I know.


What? That is definitely not true.


Forget it.


I even suggested it to you.


I guess it cannot be helped.


How can I prove it to you?


You said it could not be helped.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>?


I am not a woman to you.


If you want to prove it,


go embrace that pretty lady.


Then should I really do it?


Yes. Do it.


You better not say otherwise.


Fine, do it!


You told me to att*ck


when my opponent least expects it.


I have followed your teachings, my master.


Fine. Well done. I am proud of you.


By the way,


I heard you ran into her


in my room last time.


What about it?


Is that why you stopped me from going?


Did that happen?


I do not remember.


Understanding you is much harder


than controlling


Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's energy.


You were pulling me in, were you not?


Master, I am going to the palace today.


The <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">King</span> invited Master Lee,


and I will be accompanying him.


I had wanted to see the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span>


once again and it worked out.


Be safe.


I will. I will tell you everything


once I return.


Uk.


I found this.


I just so happened to find it.


I thought I should tell you.


Go.


Why would the leader of Songrim


look for me?


-Do you remember Mu-deok?


-Yes.


He wants to know


about her time in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village.


He could just ask her directly. Why me?


She is here.


She is not. She is in Songrim.


She is?


What could a blind girl be doing there?


Master Lee wanted you two and Jang Uk


to accompany him to the palace.


Uk too?


Is he all better now?


We need to leave right away. Get ready.


Please be careful at the palace.


The ice stone is there.


I am aware of that.


Since they are shamelessly hiding it,


I have decided to be brazen


as well and make my move.


The last time I was invited to the palace,


you were this little.


I remember enjoying the candies


you had brought from there.


By the way,


should you not prepare


a gift for His Majesty?


I have prepared one already.


Yeom.


Send the gift over to the palace on time.


Yes, master.


Was it between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.?


Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., you fool.


Right. I am sorry.


Write it down so you will not forget.


You used to be easily distracted.


Now that you have aged,


you have become forgetful as well.


Let us go.


-Goodbye, master.


-Goodbye, master.


I just cannot get used to seeing that.


Mu-deok.


The leader would like to see you.


The leader?


Mu-deok.


Everything about you


has been exposed by this man over here.


I told him about your eyes.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> my cover get blown?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lord, you see…


She was not the only one who lied.


Her grandmother begged me,


so I played along with it.


Her family has always been poor.


She lied about being blind


to avoid getting sold off to pay the debt.


It is something like


those who pretend to limp


to avoid fighting at w*r.


Why did you lie about being blind


when you were sold off to Chwiseonru?


She was planning to run away.


Sure, she was sold off due to the debt.


But it would have been easier


to run away if she pretended to be blind.


-Right?


-That is correct.


I was on the run


when I first met Young Master Jang.


He took pity and took me in.


I am sorry for lying, my lord.


What I did was wrong.


Other than lying about that,


she has never done anything wrong.


She has always been


a great granddaughter and a kind girl.


Why did you lie for me?


I just did my money's worth.


Your money's worth?


But are you really not blind?


But then again,


I did find it odd from the beginning.


-What?


-Despite being blind,


you always recognized


whoever was in front of you.


You even knew


whether it would snow or rain.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Many</span> villagers thought


you were lying about being blind.


They were creeped out and avoided you.


-I see.


-Anyway,


come to the ferry inn


if you ever need my help again.


All right?


Right.


Did you meet with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i?


She is in the capital right now.


Some thugs were looking for her.


I wonder what she did this time.


She was the one who robbed your house


after your grandmother passed away.


Do not get involved with her.


It seems you are also hiding things


Songrim does not know.


You said you did your money's worth.


Who paid you?


Ju-wol.


You do not need to thank me.


It was Young Master Jang's money.


If anyone asks or seeks Mu-deok,


use this money.


And of course, half of it is yours.


I was not hiding something heinous either.


I got my share as well.


And I like you.


I am truly grateful.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what really happened to your eyes?


Forget it.


You must have your reasons.


Had Uk not taken any measures beforehand,


Park <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span> would have found out.


If I get caught,


I will be putting Uk in danger as well.


Welcome, Master Lee Cheol.


I am grateful


for your invitation, Your Majesty.


Did that wench Shaman Choi


tell you to k*ll me?


Shaman Choi.


Could that be who the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> really is?


Mu-deok.


That <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i you were talking about.


It could have been her who came by


looking for you a few days ago.


I heard she was dangerous, so be careful.


I will not be able to recognize her


since I do not know her face.


Should I have asked that man for details?


Come to the ferry inn


if you ever need my help again.


Ferry inn.


Everything about you


has been exposed by this man over here.


Is Broker Kim from <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village here?


Yes, he just arrived.


He is in the last room


on the second floor.


Mister, it is me, Mu-deok.


Mister.


Master Lee.


If you were Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,


you must be well over a century old.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> how do you maintain


such a youthful appearance?


How old do I look, Your Majesty?


You look like


you are in your mid-thirties.


At most, forty years old.


You are right. That is my biological age.


What?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> soul is over a century old.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> body from birth


had turned into ashes long ago.


This body did not originally belong to me.


Wait.


Does that mean you have switched bodies?


That is correct.


I am a soul shifter.


Your Majesty.


Did you not summon me today


to find the soul shifter?


I will do just that.


I can recognize soul shifters.


He knew from the beginning


that Mu-deok was a soul shifter.


You must be the one


who k*lled him.


Subtitle translation by: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Soo</span>-ji Kim


ALCHEMY OF SOULS


What were all those bodies?


What kind of life has Mu-deok led?


Mu-deok is hiding something


-that must not be revealed.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness!


Instead, it will let you know by barking.


As expected, there are


more soul shifters within the palace.


If it is revealed that <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">King</span>'s <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Star</span>


was created by sorcery,


it will spell the end of Songrim.


It is dangerous.


You may not know her,


but she knows who Mu-deok is.


We need Jang g*ng.


We will have to wait


until he returns of his own accord.


Mu-deok, what are you doing here?


I cannot leave Young Master Jang.


Keep loving me to death.<br />

<@#<b>(USA) Virgin River--Season 4 Episode 9.txt</b>#@><br />
﻿The sheriff and highway patrol are aware.


Okay. Thank you, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Bert</span>.
Just can you keep me posted, please?


Okay. Bye-bye.


[knocking on door]


- Hi.
- Hey. Any word yet?


No, no.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> who's doing what?


Preacher is driving through town, looking.


Um...


Brie and <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Brady</span> are walking the riverbank


and Mike is trying
to track Jack's cell phone.


When I left the B and B,
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jo</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellen</span> was still manning the phone tree.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Bert</span> and his mechanic are out looking.


Good. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, what can I do?


- You sure you wanna stay?
- I won't let you handle this by yourself.


Well, the hospital said I could call back,


- if you could call them.
- I'll call. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Grace</span> Valley?


- Okay.
- Thank you.


[phone ringing]


- Jack?
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>, it's <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>.


Did you get my message?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>, hi.


Hey, so I'm in Clear River.


I was hoping
we could have dinner tomorrow.


Listen. I'm dealing with an emergency,


- so I can't talk. I...
- I really need to see you.


[phone beeps]


I'm getting another call.
Just call me tomorrow. Oh, God.


Hello?


[woman] No John Does
in the last hours, Dr. Hayek.


All right.


Could you transfer me
to the morgue, please?


[theme music playing]


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>, just hang in there.


We will find him. Yeah.


What did <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span> say?


[sighs] No sign of him yet.


I can't just sit around here.
I'll drive around...


You shouldn't be driving
with your macular thing.


Fine, fine.


- I'll call Denny.
- He's at the movies.


- His phone's off.
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>?


I'll go.


A, you are not cleared to drive,


and, B, you just said you had a headache.


I'll take more aspirin.


Let me repeat,
you are not cleared to drive.


We're getting to be like your truck.


Something breaks,
they no longer make replacement parts.


- It is called aging.
- God.


I wish <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lilly</span> was here.


She'd be over in a flash.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Muriel</span>. Sorry to call so late,
but do you think you could drive...?


That would be great. Yes.


- She's on her way.
- And then what?


Well, we grid the county map


and then we drive one section at a time.


Pull up a photo of Jack
in case we need to show it to some people.


- Vernon, we have to find him.
- We will leave no stone unturned.


[phone ringing]


[beeps]


Hey.


[crying] Hey, Preach.


You found anything yet?


No. Sorry.


What if he had an accident
and he's trapped?


We've got all hands on deck.
We'll find him.


It's been six hours
since anybody has heard from him.


We've got to stay positive.


I know. I'm trying.


Actually, hold on.
I think I see something.


- What the hell, Jack?
- What are you doing here?


- Looking for you.
- What?


- I got him, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>.
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> God. Thank God.


Oh, sh*t. I need to get to the wedding.


It's over, man.


- Huh?
- It's over.

I had to see you.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>, I'm so sorry I missed the wedding.
I know how important that was to you.


Oh. Okay, okay.
Right, so that's what you're sorry about.


[scoffs]


- I thought something happened to you.
- No, I'm fine.


Oh, yeah.
Well, clearly that's not the case.


Look. I, um...


Something came up
and I didn't handle it well.


Great, so you decided to drink.


I thought I could sleep it off.


I don't even know what to say to that.


[scoffs] You know,
I had the entire town looking for you.


I'll apologize to everyone, but right now
I wanna make things right with you.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>, look, I know I messed up.


Okay? I'm sorry.


Just go.

And thanks again for last night.


I know going to a wedding and then
helping me look for Jack wasn't fun.


It was fine.


And at least he's okay, you know?


I just don't understand.


- He's always been so responsible.
- That's the problem.


He acts like he's untouchable, but...


the stuff he's seen...


it's dark.


It doesn't magically disappear


just because you pretend
you got everything figured out.


Well, how did you handle it
when you got back?


Not well.


I got in fights, went to jail.


I didn't do it the right way, but...


I did let go of a lot of stuff.


Jack is hurting.
I don't know how to help him.


Just be there.


When I got back,
I didn't have anyone I could talk to.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> uncle had his own problems.
And I think if I had someone I felt...


close to, it would have really helped.


And how do you feel now?


Now I feel happy.


I know it won't last,
but right now, everything's good.


- What do you mean, it won't last?
- This is you taking a break.


Yeah, at some point,
you'll wanna go back to the city,


your big corporate legal job


with your fundraisers
and your opera tickets.


It just ain't my world.


- I hate opera.
- You know what I mean.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Brady</span>. This isn't some vacation fling.


I'm in love with you.


Right now, that's true.
And that's enough for me.


All right,
well, in case I haven't said it already,


thanks for bringing me back to my truck,
for putting me up last night.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> couch is your couch.


You talk to <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>?


- She's not picking up her phone.
- What are you gonna do?


Go to the clinic, apologize.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hope</span> she's calmed down.


- I don't blame her for being mad at you.
- Neither do I.


[Preacher] Hey, listen, man.


I want you to know that I think of you
as family, so I'll be straight with you.


Work out your issues,
find out what's going on up here.


Hmm.


Talk to <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Barry</span> Martinez, he's a therapist.


Tell me, how is a civilian gonna
understand what I'm dealing with?


He did two tours in the Marines.


He's got a master's in psychology
and he runs my veterans support group.


I told you, I'm not gonna be
sitting around in a circle


with a group of guys
talking about my feelings.


He does one-on-ones. I've been doing them
since Christopher disappeared.


Without <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Barry</span>, I would've lost it.


Glad therapy works,
but don't think it's my thing.


Whatever it is you're doing,
it ain't working.


At least give it a try, man.


- What is that?
- Blueberry muffins for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Muriel</span>.


As a thank-you for last night.
Can you drop them off on your way to work?


Well, sure, sure. That was...
That was very thoughtful of you.


She was a good sport last night.


For putting up
with your backseat driving, she sure was.


Jack is safe,
and that's all that needs to be said.


Mm-hm.


Have you seen Denny?


Yeah, he left a note,
said he's running errands.


Oh.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>...


what are you doing today?


I don't know.


I can't stop thinking about <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lilly</span>.


Last night made me realize how much
I depended on her in emergencies.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Muriel</span> is not exactly a calming influence.


Mm. Mm.


Why don't you give <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Tara</span> a call?


Maybe seeing her
would help you feel closer to <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lilly</span>.


Maybe, or it'll make me miss her more.


What if seeing you makes <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Tara</span> feel better?


That'd be pretty good, wouldn't it?


Hey. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span> here?


- She's in with a patient.
- I'll wait.


- You want some coffee?
- Sure.


- How do you take it? Black?
- Yeah, thanks.


- Cheers.
- Yeah.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> any idea how long she's gonna be?


It's hard to say.
She's been out of sorts this morning.


- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's tired, distracted.


- Last night was hard on her.
- Right.


I know this is none of my business,
but it's obvious how much she loves you.


It is none of your business.


I'm just trying to help.
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>'s a great woman and...


Look, I don't know what you're hoping
to get out of the situation.


You have no idea
what you're talking about.


I'm not hoping to get anything.
I'm simply observing.


Do me a favor,
keep your observations to yourself.


Hey.


I need to talk to you outside.


Thanks for the coffee.


[sighs]


What the hell was that?


Why are you being rude to Cameron?


He got under my skin.


Okay. What are you doing here?


I need five minutes.


What happened last night was unacceptable,
and I'm sorry I made you worry.


Okay, you know what?
Worry doesn't come close.


I thought you were in a ditch.


- I couldn't drive.
- Oh, right.


Right. You couldn't drive.


- What happened to quitting?
- Last night was an exception.


The night of my sister's wedding
was an exception.


Look, it's not gonna happen again.


- How am I supposed to believe you?
- I made a decision.


I'm done. I'm done with drinking.
I'm done with living in the past.


Jack, trauma is not a switch
you can turn on and off by yourself.


I know. I get it.


- You get it?
- Yeah.


Then why do we keep having
this conversation?


You know what?
I can't talk to you anymore.


[door slams]


[phone ringing]


Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>.


Hi. Oh, I'm glad you answered.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> can you meet me for dinner?
- Tonight's not a good night. I...


I really need to see you.


I know, but I didn't sleep
at all last night.


Can we do it tomorrow?


Paul and I are leaving in the morning.
What if you go early?


Hey. Here to pick up <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hope</span>'s lunch order.


- Tuna on rye?
- Unfortunately, that's the one.


- Not a fan of tuna?
- Not when it's in my car.


Hey, so Ten Pins in Clear River's doing
cosmic bowling tonight. Wanna go?


Um...


I can't. Preacher's leaving early,
so I'm closing tonight.


- How about tomorrow night?
- Maybe. I'll have to check with Connie.


Okay. No worries.


Just let me know.


- Okay.
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span> you later.


- Why are you lying to him?
- Why are you spying on me?


I have never seen you volunteer
to talk to Connie about anything.


- Ugh. You're so annoying.
- But I'm right.


Fine. I was looking for a phone charger


and I found a stash
of Klonopin in Denny's stuff.


- What did you do?
- I told Doc.


Why did you do that?


Because it wasn't prescribed to him,


and if Denny has a drug problem,
Doc should know about it.


If it was his dad or grandma, maybe
they gave it to him to help him sleep.


He doesn't seem like an addict.


You think he has a good reason
for having those pills?


He might. You'd have to ask.


You're right. Thanks.


- For what?
- Being such a good friend.


Hey, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Ricky</span>. How's it going?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> sucks, Preach.


[knocking on door]


Come in. [clears throat]


Okay. If you're here
to read me the riot act, don't.


I know perfectly well what I did.


I just came by to say,
if you need anything, I'm here for you.


- God, I screwed up, Brie.
- Right.


Because you're human.


Why are you being so understanding?
I've been pretty tough on you.


Oof. I know. You gave me a free place
to live, you helped me get a job,


introduced me to your friends,
I can't believe we're still talking.


Well, you're family.
I'm always gonna look out for you.


It goes both ways.


How's Sugar? Have you been riding?


Few times, but it's hard.


I keep expecting my mom's
gonna walk out of the barn to greet us.


And that'll never happen again.


You've been so brave,
and taking care of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Chloe</span>...


I should be thanking <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Chloe</span>.
She's the reason I get out of bed.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> fact, I should relieve the sitter.


Oh. Oh.


Thanks for coming over.
I didn't have it in me to face the farm.


I totally get it.


You know, it can be bittersweet,
but when I'm out there,


I feel like Mom's all around me.


Wish I had a place like that.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> make one.


Go somewhere you think
she'd have loved and make it your spot.


And do what?


[chuckles] Nothing.


Just reflect.


I'm not very good at sitting still.
Let alone being quiet.


Well, might be worth trying.
It's been really good for me.


- Thank you.
- Oh, sweetheart, thank you.


[on voicemail] You've reached Denny,
please leave a message.


Denny, Denny, it's Doc.


I was wondering
if you would stop by the clinic today.


There's something I want
to discuss with you, privately. Bye.


- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?


Ah.


I'm okay.


- Could have taken the day off.
- I know.


I just didn't want
to be alone with my thoughts.


Oh, I have been there, believe me.


- And you and Jack have a lot going on.
- Yeah, we do.


[phone ringing]


Look, I'm not making an excuse
for what Jack did, but, uh...


The veteran's experience
is uniquely complex.


- [phone chimes, buzzes]
- I know.


I know, I just...
I don't know how he'll get out


of this destructive cycle
if he won't get help.


It's the fear.


The fear of reliving the pain...


that trumps reason.


Maybe this will clarify things. Uh...


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">January</span> , ,
was one of the biggest campaigns


by the North Vietnamese
in the Vietnam w*r.


Took me years


before I could say
the phrase "Tet Offensive" out loud.


It was that bad.


Doc, I'm so sorry.


- I'm not telling you this for sympathy,
- [cell phone chimes]


I'm trying to explain how deep
some vets bury the trauma of w*r


in order to function day to day.


Not something I'm ever gonna understand.


I feel so helpless.


All I'm saying is don't give up on him.


What you guys have is...
Well, it's worth fighting for.


- [phone ringing]
- Yeah.


Well, someone is really trying
to get ahold of you.


It's <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>, my sister-in-law.
She wants to have dinner tonight.


It's not like you to avoid someone.


I don't know if that's entirely true,
but I'm just exhausted.


And she is, uh... difficult.


I know it is your nature
to put others' needs above your own,


but give yourself a break on this one.


Just do what's best for you.


Yeah.


Hello, Daniel.


- It's <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Brady</span>. Do I know you?
- We have not been formally introduced.


I'm <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Melissa</span>.


- And?
- And this is my operation.


Well, it's a family business,
but I run the day-to-day.


That so?


And how do I know
you are who you are and not some cop?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Calvin</span> promised you the keys
to the kingdom when he retired.


Is that right?


I also know
your collaboration with law enforcement


precipitated the raid on <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Emerald</span> Lumber.


- That's not true.
- Cut the crap, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Brady</span>.


If there's one thing I cannot stomach,
it's a liar. Just ask <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Calvin</span>.


- That's why he's been... demoted.
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> why are you still dealing with me?


Because you have collateral,
which I believe will keep you in line.


You're talking about the business?


Oh. I'm talking about
your girlfriend, Brie.


- Now, when the shipment arrives...
- Like I told <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Calvin</span>...


I don't deal with the dr*gs.


Well, our night business
might spill into your day business.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I'm gonna need you to cooperate.


Fine.


But just so you know...


if anything happens to Brie...


I'll burn this place down.


Ooh. Passionate.


I like that.


I'll be in touch.


I went to the clerk's office
to check for small water sources.


But when I pulled up a topography map,
I found an inconsistency.


On a current map,
you won't find any water sources


near Shelter Mountain,
but an older map clearly shows a reservoir


- just east of the lower bridge.
- [phone ringing]


- Where's the map?
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> my car.


- Okay. Sounds good. I'll go check it out.
- Well, we'll go.


- I found the map. I'm going with you.
- No. Brie, it...


It's not safe. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Calvin</span>'s probably armed.


I've gotten this far.
I'm not just gonna walk away now.


Okay.


Fine, but I'm calling for backup.


And if anything goes down,
you follow my orders.


For example?


If I say "run"...


you run.


Didn't want to startle you.


Come in. Sit down.


Sorry it took me so long to get here.


- I was hiking.
- It's okay.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you wanted to see me.
- Yes.


No easy way to say this,
so I'll just be direct.


It has come to my attention
you have a bottle of Klonopin


that is not in your name.
And in addition to that,


I suspect you went through
the clinic's financial files,


which are highly confidential.


And after the incident
with the drug cabinet...


I gotta think to myself
there's something seriously wrong here.


I did go through the clinic's financials
without permission.


Why? Why would you do that?


When my dad passed away...


I got a big insurance payout.


It's a lot of money.
I wanna use it for something good.


Something that'll help people
and live on in his memory.


I'm not following you here.


I used the funds
to pay off the clinic's mortgage.


Thought it'd be cool if you received
a zero-balance mortgage statement.


Wow, I...


I don't know what to say,
except thank you.


That is extremely generous.


You and your practice help so many people.
This is what my dad would've wanted.


I'm glad you think so.


But I still gotta ask,
what about the prescription?


Now, if I tell you, you're gonna look
at me differently, and I...


- I don't know if I can stand that.
- I have trusted you so far.


It's time you gave me
the benefit of the doubt.


And you promise you won't tell anyone?
Even if you think you're trying to help.


I give you my word.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Muriel</span>.


If you're trying
to get me to like you, you're winning.

- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>.


I...


- I wasn't sure if you would actually come.
- Well, I'm here for Mark.


If you needed something,
he would have shown up, so...


Oh.


Yeah.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>, I know that I have been...


I've been terrible to you.


Yeah, that reminds me, I, uh...


I got your sonogram.


Oh, I'm so sorry. I...


I shouldn't have sent that.


It was insensitive.


I also apologize
for asking for your wedding ring.


It was totally inappropriate.


Oh.


Uh, wow. Okay.


Um...


- Thank you. Thank you for apologizing.
- I really mean it.


I believe you.


Yeah, we're really excited.


Just having a hard time
with knowing that my daughter


is never gonna meet her uncle Mark.


I'm sure it's hard
not being able to share this with him.


Yeah, it is.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>, Mark loved you so much.


And you knew him better
than anybody, so I was thinking


if we work together, we could help
keep Mark's memory alive for my daughter.


Yeah, that would be nice.


I'm glad that you called.


Actually, nobody knows this yet,
but we're gonna name her <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Monroe</span> for Mark.


Oh, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>.


Mark would be thrilled.


Are you really that mad at me?


What now?


Well, my aunt from Portland
is throwing a baby shower for <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Todd</span> and I,


and we sent out the invitations last week


and I haven't gotten a response
from you or <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>.


- We didn't get an invitation.
- Well, I'm positive I sent it.


It didn't arrive.


Okay. Well, um...


all the information's in here.


The club had a cancellation,


so we're having it there
instead of the B and B.


Uh, there's gonna be a chocolate fountain


and <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Todd</span>'s buying
a case of Dom for the toast.


- Sounds fancy.
- You're gonna be there, right?


- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
- You were so pissed at me


for not telling you the twins were boys.


And one of the things I respect most
about you is that you're honest.


Even when it's something
I don't wanna hear.


- There were plenty of those.
- There's plenty of those.


But I learned that I can depend on you.


That's all I really want for the twins,
is parents they can trust.


- Because I never really had that.
- I know.


Thank you.


You know, Char,
our boys are gonna have two parents


that love
and support them unconditionally.


Yeah.


That's better than either of us had.


- You should feel good about that.
- I do. Yeah.


But there is one thing
that's kind of been bugging me.


What's that?


Why didn't you tell me
you and <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span> are getting married?


Huh?


I saw <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span> at a store
buying a wedding dress.


No, no, her sister got married.


Oh.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> she was telling the truth.


- Well, why wouldn't she?
- I don't know. To protect my feelings.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charmaine</span>,
we just said I've been straight with you.


- Yeah.
- All right? <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> is <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Mel</span>.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> going forward, you never have to worry
about being lied to, okay?


Hey, Jack,
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Barry</span> Martinez is here to see you.


[Jack] Thanks.


I gotta go, but we'll talk at the shower.


- Okay. Thanks. Yeah.
- Thanks for the invite.


Hey. Jack <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sheridan</span>. Thanks for coming.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Barry</span>. Glad you called.


Yeah.


Uh, why don't we speak in my office?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> Preacher said
that you were in the Corps.


Yeah. Third Battalion, First Marines.


Oh, Thundering Third.


You guys were some of the first Marines
to get into Iraq, right?


Mm-hm.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you were there for...
- Phantom Fury, yeah.


Yep. It was as bad as advertised.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> how did you get into this?


Well, over Marines from my battalion
have committed su1c1de since .


That's more
than we lost the entire operation.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I figured
if I can help just one soldier...


it would honor the ones
who didn't make it home.


- That's pretty noble.
- Not really. It's...


It's what helped me recover.


What can I do for you?


Uh, I don't know.
Probably nothing. I mean, I...


Just things haven't really, um...


been going so well.


- Have you tried therapy in the past?
- No. No, I kind of try to rely on myself


- to solve my problems.
- [chuckles] Right.


The best thing to do
is you take whatever's broken apart...


and you put it back together
piece by piece.


That way, you can be sure
you found the source of the problem.


Okay.


And how long does that take?


No, if it's done correctly,
there is no timeline.


Hey. Up for a visitor?


Come in.


Would you like to sit down?


Yeah, sure.


Uh...


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, um...


I... Like, I didn't know if I should call.


I want to apologize.


I know it seems like
I've been sending you mixed messages.


That was never my intent.


It's just that
when you started asking me those questions


about Christopher, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Paige</span>...


I didn't know how to answer them.


It's, um...


It's not my story to tell.


Mm.


That's very cryptic, don't you think?


Bottom line is that <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Paige</span> and I...


we're not together.


Thank you for clarifying that.


[both chuckle]


Still, I am not a clean slate.


Now, if you don't wanna deal with me,
you know, I get it. I've got baggage.


We all do.


Truth is,
neither of us are fortune tellers.


Instead, all I can do
is be as honest as possible.


Well, if we are laying our cards
on the table...


I have feelings for you.


- And I think you have feelings for me too?
- I do.


Your smile,
it knocks me out every single time.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> for right now,
that is all I need to know.


Thanks again for seeing me and just
for being so awesome about everything.


Oh, my gosh, of course.
I can't wait to meet <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Monroe</span>,


and if you ever need a break,
just let me know and I'll fly down.


Oh, I will take you up on that.


- No, it's my treat. It's my treat.
- No, no, no.


- We are celebrating you becoming a mother.
- Aw.


- Okay?
- Thank you.


- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.


Um, There's something I wanted
to tell you, but it's not really my place.


Okay. What?


Okay.


Mom hired a lawyer
to seek custody of your last two embryos.


What?


Mark told her
that you guys had two embryos left


and she got it in her head
that she could hire a surrogate


and raise Mark's kid.


I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that's just so insane.


- I don't even know what to say.
- I totally agree and I'm so sorry.


I didn't want you to be blindsided.


Mm. I gotta admit, this isn't exactly
how I imagined this day ending.


Mm-hm.


[phone ringing]


Let me turn this thing off.


- Can you just give me two minutes?
- I'm not going anywhere.


[chuckles]


Hello.


[Christopher] Preach.


- Christopher?
- I don't understand.


Uncle <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Vince</span> is acting weird.


- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


Where are you?


- I don't know.
- Christopher,


this is important. You recognize anything
about where you are right now?


No. We've been driving around a lot,


- but <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Vince</span> makes me hide in the backseat.
- Whose phone are you using?


Uncle <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Vince</span>'s.


- He let you have it?
- No.


Usually hides his phone at night,


- but he fell asleep and left it out.
- That's very brave of you.


I remembered your number from summer camp.


Good for you.


Preach...


I wanna come home.


I know, buddy.


We're gonna get you home.


You sure
there isn't anything you can tell me


about where you are?
Are you near the ocean?


- He's awake. I gotta go.
- Christopher...


Hey.


I'm gonna take a shower.


All right, can we please just talk first?


- We already talked.
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you'd rather stay mad?


No. But there is nothing you could say
that's gonna make me feel better


- about what happened last night.
- I know, and that's why today,


I met with Preach's therapist.


- You saw a therapist?
- Yeah.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Barry</span>, he's a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Marine</span>.


Okay.


- Why did you decide to call him?
- Because I agree with you.


I need help.


And I can't just keep telling you
that I'm gonna get my act together.


Okay.


How was it?


It was awkward as hell.


I agreed to do a few sessions with him.


Hey, Jack...


- if you're doing this for me...
- No.


I mean, you're part of the reason, but...


I'm tired of pretending everything's okay.


You taking this step means a lot to me.


I meant it when I said
everything's gonna get better, okay?


I really meant it.


Okay.


I was scared.
I thought something had happened to you.


I know, I know, I know,
and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know.


I love you.


- Sorry. I can't lose you. Okay?
- You're not going to. No.


Everything's gonna be okay, I promise.


I promise you.


Listen, um...


I have to tell you,
I went and had dinner with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Stacie</span>.


- How did that go?
- She told me that Mark's mom, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Cassandra</span>...


- wants custody of my embryos.
- Oh, come on. Is that even a thing?


[scoffs] No, but, I mean,
anybody can file a lawsuit.


- But what...? What about...?
- No, she doesn't know I'm pregnant.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> if she finds out,
she's gonna want custody of the baby?


I don't know.


If it turns out to be Mark's baby...


Think she'd go through
with something like that?


I don't know.
But when <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Cassandra</span> wants something,


she will do anything she can to get it.


- Here it is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll wait for backup.


- Well, where are they?
- I gave out the coordinates.


Should be here any minute.


I don't see anyone.


Hey, look.


Is that <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Calvin</span>?


Yeah.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Howard</span>, where the hell's backup?
Got eyes on <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Calvin</span>.


[<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Howard</span>] We're closing in now.
Do not engage. I repeat, do not engage.


Crap. He knows we're here.


He's getting aw...<br />
<br />
<@#<b>(UAE) Alchemy of Souls--Episode 14.txt</b>#@><br />
﻿I heard you have been going fishing


with Uk these days.


That is true.


It is so boring to fish alone.


You once said that


Uk shares the same fate


as Master Seo Gyeong.


Is that why you are encouraging


and guiding him?


I am not the one guiding him.


Then is there someone else?


Who is it?


Do you know who that person is?


No one is teaching Uk


how to do spells right now.


I can be sure of it.


It was confirmed by his maid


who is always by his side.


Are you saying he progressed


that much single-handedly?


He may have become a mage of Jeongjingak


thanks to his schemes and good luck.


But he has no skills.


I am sure you have heard


of our ongoing bet.


He has yet to win once.


You are right.


If he had a master, his master would have


prevented him from being humiliated.


Reading Words of the Heart


had won him respect.


But our bet has humiliated him.


Seeing how he has not given up,


that object


must mean a lot to him.


Are you all right? Can you see?


Yes. And you, Young Master?


Did you get hurt anywhere?


You are right.


I did not know


how important this was to him.


Once Uk returns,


Beom would want to have


their duel right away.


But he is busy fishing right now?


And Mu-deok is letting him do that?


Gosh.


I doubt she would have let him.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you can also see


that Uk listens to Mu-deok.


He is stubborn about things


no matter what others tell him.


But he always listens to Mu-deok.


We can also protect


the monsters from this world.


The monster


he was talking about was Naksu.


If he is looking for


the ice stone to protect her…


-They must not be together.


-What?


Why not?


Do you not like that they are close?


I do not.


If they end up going down the wrong path,


there will be nothing I can do.


Uk is someone who can potentially


bring chaos to the world.


What if we support and raise him


into an uncontrollable individual


and he becomes the center


of the world's attention?


Are you afraid that he will desire


to become king according to his fate


and bring chaos to Daeho?


It may be possible


if he learns of the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">King</span>'s <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Star</span>.


It will forever broaden his horizons


and desire to achieve greatness.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span>.


How long did it take you to reach Chisu?


Chisu?


It did not take me long to reach Ryusu,


but it did take some time to reach Chisu.


It took me three years


to look into the sky's energy,


three years to read the land's energy,


and four years to feel


the energy around me.


The energy from the sky and land,


and water that bridges between them.


It took me ten years to master them all


and reach Chisu.


That is incredible.


It took me 13 years.


And it took Yeom twice as long.


I was the second fastest after Jang g*ng.


But you see…


We say this energy flows


between heaven and earth.


But in fact, this is just water.


It took us over ten years


to finally grasp this energy.


But there are those


who can do that from birth.


Simply put, they are geniuses.


But to the world,


they seem reckless, unreliable,


and even dangerous at times.


Did I just


reach Chisu?


That is because


they are different from the rest of us.


Some could be jealous of them.


While others could be worried about them.


I will definitely win tomorrow.


I caught it.


Really?


Uk.


You have reached Chisu.


We react that way because we do not know


how they will use their terrifying powers.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> he save this world


like Master Seo Gyeong did?


Or will he do the very opposite?


We do not know.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> are you saying


that you will continue to watch him?


Do not worry. I am debating as well.


If we need to get rid of that power,


I will do so with my own hands.


Uk, is your probation period over?


That is why I am back.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you destroyed Cheonbugwan?


Do not exaggerate.


-Hey.


-You are finally back.


I am your final opponent.


-I see.


-I feel bad that


you will not be able to win


since I happen to be your last opponent.


You are right.


I hope the finale will not be boring.


I am counting on you.


What was that?


Did he undergo a new kind of training?


I heard he only went fishing.


Do not worry. He is just talking big.


I will humiliate him


in front of the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> today.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> foolish young master


lost nine duels so far


and thus made you lose


nine precious gold toads.


I do not deserve to look you in the eye.


Is there one duel left?


He trained hard,


so he will not disappoint you


this time around.


If I am not to be disappointed,


he should lose again.


You took me for a fool.


You were using my gold


to train your young master.


Thanks to the duels,


you had the satisfaction of watching


my young master get humiliated.


I believe that alone was worth the gold.


Yes, they were entertaining.


I hope he will lose this time again


so I can see you cry


after losing this to me.


Uk has the other half, does he not?


Since he had given this to you,


was this a symbol of love?


Did you give this up so you could use me?


If Uk loses and this becomes mine,


I will destroy it.


You must lose something as well.


What a pity.


Your heartwrenching love


will be thrown away.


Do as you please.


That jade did its job


by allowing my young master


to have ten duels.


Did you not say that


this was precious enough to bet your life?


If he and I shared feelings


worth betting my life on,


losing that would not affect


the feelings we have toward each other.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you really do not care


if you lose this?


Fine.


Then I will throw this away.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> it really meant nothing to you.


Then you have deceived me.


You had said


it was your most precious belonging.


But if you do not care about it,


that means you have lied.


How will you pay for what you have done?


You said you have bet your life?


Fine.


This time, place yourself for the bet.


I already lost nine gold toads.


I do not wish to lose another.


The reward for this next duel


will be you.


Do as you please.


If Jang Uk loses,


you will be serving whoever beats him.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


I will keep that in mind.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you are Uk's last opponent?


I am Cha Beom.


I will defeat him no matter what.


You must win this duel.


If you fail,


I will see to it


that you never succeed in life as a mage.


Can you give me your word?


There are always variables in every duel…


Forget it!


I only need those


who will definitely win the duel.


Give me your word.


I am afraid I cannot do that,


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


No one expected him…


to defeat you either.


There is only one person who can b*at him


at all costs.


It is Seo Yul.


Seo Yul.


The bet started as nothing serious.


But I am beyond annoyed at this point.


I spent nine gold toads


just to put that arrogant Uk in his place.


Imagine how ridiculous I will look


if he happens to win the final match


due to some bizarre reason.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I need someone


who can b*at him for certain.


As the best mage of Jeongjingak


and my cousin,


I believe you are the only one.


I know you two are very close.


But as the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> and your cousin,


could you help me out this once?


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Really?


You will fight Uk for me?


I will win.


I give you my word.


That is right.


You of all people can do that.


Did Mu-deok really promise to serve


whoever b*at Uk?


Yes. Instead of the gold toad…


She decided to put herself as the bet.


Then I will b*at Uk


and take her in as my maid.


All right, then.


The person fighting Jang Uk


for his last duel. Step forward.


Uk.


The person you will be fighting against


is me.


Yul could not have volunteered


just so he could let Uk win, right?


No way.


When Dang-gu volunteered,


Uk refused to fight him.


He will not let Uk win.


He gave the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> his word


and said he would b*at Uk.


You may begin.


Yul was right.


Uk has greatly improved.


That is my shield spell.


When did he master that?


He just picked them up


through his previous duels.


Did he master all of his opponents' spells


from his previous nine duels?


He has learned and is mimicking


some spells from his previous duels.


He did it.


The duel has ended.


Seo Yul has won.


I knew it.


Uk lost all ten duels.


How did he use Tansu at the end?


He collected the energy in the air


and turned it into water.


That is absurd.


Only those


who have reached Chisu can do that.


When did you reach Chisu?


I told you yesterday that


I had something surprising to tell you.


That is incredible.


Congratulations.


Uk!


You have reached Chisu.


Congratulations, my friend!


Did you see that?


Our fellow mage, Jang Uk,


has reached Chisu!


-Really?


-Hey.


-Congratulations.


-Congratulations.


-You are amazing.


-Congratulations!


Hey!


Let us head to Sejukwon.


Mu-deok just left with the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.


They are probably


putting an end to their bet.


I am just worried they may be


up to something ridiculous again.


I will go and check.


Yes. You should take care of her.


After all, you are now her owner.


That is what we want


the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> to think.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> Yul can go to see Mu-deok.


Uk, come with me to Sejukwon.


Let us go. Hurry.


-Be careful. Come on.


-That hurts.


Watch out.


Like you said, my young master


was defeated ten times.


You have won, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


You already knew


that he had reached Chisu.


That is why you did not hesitate


to place yourself as the bet.


Had Master Cha Beom competed


like he was supposed to,


my young master would have won.


He is no longer your young master.


You will be serving Yul from now on.


You said you two shared


quite intimate feelings.


All right.


I hope you continue doing that


while serving a new owner.


That is ridiculous.


How could he have reached Chisu already?


It is true. We all witnessed it.


Is this true?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness!


He is truly incredible!


Uk, look at you!


-That hurts!


-Sorry!


Master Heo, I am in pain.


You stepped up because you were worried


that I might have to serve


Master Cha Beom, right?


Thank you so much for your kindness.


You will be serving me from now on.


That was a promise


I had made for the duel.


I need to pretend


to keep up with my promise.


Of course.


Feel free to let me know


if you need me to run any errands.


I will not need anything from you.


You can visit Uk whenever you want.


However,


there is one thing I ask of you.


Once I complete my training here


and return to Seoho Fortress,


there is someone


I would like to take with me.


Please help me


do that.


I did not know you had someone like that.


Give me your word.


Promise that you will help me.


You are asking me this favor as my owner.


I will do so at all costs.


There is a soul shifter


in Sejukwon right now.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> how could you bring Uk here?


What could I have done? He was hurt.


I told him to rest up for a few days.


-Is he badly hurt?


-No.


It is nothing serious.


How reckless of him to fight against Yul.


We should have just let him


keep fishing with Master Lee.


We should not have summoned him.


They must have done


more than just fishing.


Uk reached Chisu.


What?


Is that not incredible?


How unbelievable.


He is indeed extraordinary.


What have you been learning


while fishing


with Master Lee?


I learned how to catch a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Golden</span> Fish.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> he was determined


to help you reach Chisu.


-Has he taken you in as his pupil?


-No, Master Heo.


There is a reason


why he is taking care of me.


And what could that be?


Was there something


that…


he told you about?


It was regarding a family matter.


I caught onto it and asked him first.


It seems like you are already aware of it.


I had hoped…


you would not find out.


No.


It was not something I could turn


a blind eye to upon finding out.


What will you do?


About Maidservant Kim.


What about her?


Master Lee is trying to win


Maidservant Kim over


by treating me well.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what will you do?


I mean, Master Lee is a wonderful man


who has helped me greatly.


But still…


I thought I should give you


the opportunity first,


given our history together.


What opportunity?


Did you know that Master Lee


has recently been staying at our house?


I was wondering where he was staying.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> he has been staying at your house.


Yes.


Since I am away, they must be enjoying


a lovely meal together.


Since she has a soft heart,


she loves providing for


and feeding others.


It is only a matter of time


until she falls for him.


I truly hope


she can marry a loving man.


If it is fine with you,


I would like to root for them.


Master Lee is unbelievably older than her.


But on the outside,


he looks younger than you.


It is still absurd.


He practices chastity while training.


How could they get married?


I had cut off my libido to train,


but I have since recovered.


It is not impossible.


Marriage should be consensual.


She needs to want it as well.


She has been in love


with a certain individual


for all these years.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span>.


Do you really think


she is still in love with Jang g*ng?


I know her the best.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> please do not assume things.


Goodness.


You call others slow-witted


when you are the slow one.


You know nothing!


It has been ages


since she stopped loving Jang g*ng.


He was here


last time as well.


It is freshly-made quince tea.


It is fragrant.


Is it not good to keep


withered flowers at home.


It is not easy to find flowers


since it is colder now.


But I should listen to you


and throw them out.


I liked how the flowers


kept me company.


I completely forgot about the cups


and only brought the kettle.


How did they come back to life?


Was it Master Lee?


How beautiful.


He must have been


the one who gave her


those wildflowers too.


You are truly kind and warmhearted.


Am I?


Feel free to stay here


as long as you want.


I will cater to you as best as I can.


Thank you.


Was she Jang g*ng's wife?


Yes. She is very beautiful, is she not?


She must be the woman <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span>


was head over heels with as Yeom said.


She has not withered away


and is still just as beautiful.


Perhaps that is why


he still cannot forget her.


Or perhaps,


he just does not like me.


I do not know.


I understand it was


the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>'s command.


But how could he forbid me


from visiting Mu-deok?


She must be worried sick about me.


I am sure she is just busy.


I told her you were doing fine.


No.


Do you think


she would be relieved after hearing that?


She needs to see me in person.


Come here.


Seeing her will only hurt you.


I use this homing bird


to send letters to Seoho Fortress.


It would take three to four days


for a horse to arrive there.


Does this bird really fly that far?


How incredible.


Do you have the whistle I gave you?


I am sorry. I do not carry it with me.


It was given to you


by the person you are in love with.


I am hurt.


The homing bird will return


after two long blows on this whistle.


You seemed to be good at this.


Give it a try.


There.


The bird has returned.


Now, do two short ones.


I only said that to put him at ease.


He was worried that his pet bird


might have suffered during the winter,


so I told him that.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>? Mu-deok is doing well.


Wait. Uk.


What exactly did the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>


and Mu-deok bet on?


The thing you wanted to get.


It does not matter.


I cannot get it now since I lost.


But how could she look


so nonchalant after losing it?


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what was it?


-Do not ask.


Why have you not once visited Uk


in Sejukwon?


There is no need to mind me


just because I am your new owner.


That is not why.


I am just trying not to be shameless.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you really do not care


if you lose this?


I must find it.


I need to find it by tonight.


Only then can I see him without shame.


I knew it.


Uk has cut off his libido.


He dishonored the mages and ran away.


It was odd how he improved so quickly


and b*at the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.


He chose to become Master Lee's pupil


and has practiced chastity.


Did you all see Master Lee?


He was Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,


and Master Heo was his pupil.


But he looks younger than our leader.


That is because he practiced chastity.


I heard he does not age because he reached


a high degree at such a young age.


Really? I heard he became young again


thanks to a spell.


A spell?


Whatever the case may be,


Uk sure is determined.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what if he has reached Chisu?


If it were me,


I would have never practiced chastity.


Of course not. Me neither.


-He is so persistent.


-Tell me about it.


They are just jealous.


Young Master Jang is subjected


to all sorts of horrible rumors.


I was able


to get some much-needed sleep lately


thanks to her medicine.


I am glad


that your herbal medicine is effective.


I used the valerian that I got


from the wetlands of Wol Fortress.


It is known for its calming effect.


It must have helped you relax


and fall asleep better.


I can see why Master Heo recommended you.


Thankfully, I am now able


to get some sleep.


But the ringing in my ears


and the splitting headache still remain.


They have worsened


after the news of the soul shifter


surprised you last month.


A soul shifter tried to enter the palace.


There could easily be one in here already.


Assistant Gwanju <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span> Mu


strengthened the security,


so do not worry.


The soul shifter who tried to enter


the palace was one of his men.


There were also rumors


about a soul shifter


being spotted in Cheonbugwan.


I cannot trust anyone.


It seems like your anxiety


stems from your heart, Your Majesty.


What do you think about finding


an alternative way to calm yourself?


Do you know Hemp Master Lee?


The last pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.


I have heard of him


but only saw him once in Songrim.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> grandfather was his pupil,


so I have heard stories about him.


He may be able to relieve your anxiety.


Are you saying he can tell


if there is a soul shifter around me?


I do not know him that well


since I have not met him.


Perhaps you could invite him


to your palace and ask for his help.


I told you to clean her room every day!


How could you let the water


in this vase rot?


I am sorry, my lady!


Imagine if Bu-yeon returned


and saw this vase full of stagnant water.


She would be disappointed in me.


Change the bedsheets,


and get rid of that!


She cannot see,


so why would you place that there


and run the risk of her tripping?


Dozens of girls have come,


but none of them were Bu-yeon.


Being disappointed over and over again


must have made Mother easily distressed.


I agree.


But it will be your birthday soon.


-Here.


-What is this?


Father, they are so pretty.


But it is not my birthday yet.


I will get you


something prettier on your birthday.


I will try it on right now.


Please put it on for me.


Sure.


Let me see how pretty you are.


You always used to braid my hair


back when I was little.


Mother never did that.


I am sorry. Did that hurt a lot?


I am fine.


I must have lost my touch


since it had been a while.


I am sorry.


That is all right. Do I look pretty?


You are always beautiful.


Park <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span> sh*t me with this bow.


I was defeated that day.


I cannot give any excuses


or take back the outcome of a fight.


But once I regain my strength,


I would like to have


a proper fight with him.


What are you doing?


I am cleaning, my lord.


Be careful what you touch.


Touch a w*apon filled with the energy


of a high-degree mage,


and a girl like you could get hurt.


Even I am aware of that, my lord.


But I did wonder


why you would place this here


when I have to clean the desk.


I usually hang it up well.


I simply forgot.


But you are still young.


I cannot believe


you are already forgetful.


I am just worried as a member of Songrim.


What if you forget to pay me?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lord.


Please be healthy. You are still young.


I will come back later to clean, my lord.


What a clever


and daring girl she is.


How did Mu-deok


and Uk first meet?


I do not know the details,


but I heard he paid her debt


and took her out of Chwiseonru.


Then go to Chwiseonru


and ask around about her.


Find out her background


and what kind of girl she is.


I am just curious that is all.


I do not know well either.


But the broker who brought her here


is in the capital at the moment.


I will tell him to go to Songrim.


Hey, you there.


We met in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village, right?


What is it this time?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i.


Have you not seen her in the capital?


Do you know where she could be?


I do not know.


She is not a native of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village.


She only stayed for a few months


and then stole the villagers' belongings.


Let me know if you catch her.


Where can I find her?


Darn it.


You have made some bad friends, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i.


Could she have gone to find Mu-deok?


I will take you to Jinyowon soon.


But there is something


we need to take care of first.


Here. Eat this.


You took my purse, right?


Give me back my ring.


Are they the ones you met in the capital?


That is correct,


but why did you bring them here?


I love that you are persistent and smart.


But that is also what makes you dangerous.


There is something I want you to see.


Assistant Gwanju.


Thank you for feeding me.


Be afraid.


Betray me or get your cover blown,


and you will meet the same fate.


All right.


Tell me if there is anyone else


who will recognize you.


I must get rid of them.


Is there anyone else?


Yes, my lord.


Search thoroughly.


I definitely threw it in there.


I cannot find it.


Search over there.


I had searched that area thoroughly,


but there was nothing.


Look again.


I can barely see--


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.


Yes, look over there.


What are you doing?


I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.


Yes, look over there.


What are you doing?


It is none of your business. Go on.


I am afraid Eunuch Oh


will needlessly suffer.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I must say something. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">May</span> I?


What is it?


Could you possibly


be looking


for this?


You found it?


I searched day and night


and found it not too long ago.


You threw it away.


Since I picked it up,


it is mine once again.


Goodness.


Eunuch Oh, you can stop and come out.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Darn it.


Thanks to you,


I retrieved something precious.


I owe this all to you,


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


That is right.


I did not destroy it


or throw it too far away.


You only found it


because I threw it nearby.


If I may dare to try to understand you,


could you be giving yourself credit


and being grumpy


because you feel bad?


As Filthy Mu-deok,


you ought to just listen to what I say.


How dare you try to understand me?


I apologize, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Master Heo told me to tell you


that Master Lee is here.


All right. Is he at Sejukwon?


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


His pupil, Jang Uk, is with him.


It is said that Uk


made such sudden progress


thanks to Master Lee's bizarre training.


If that were not the case,


he would not have been able


to hold a candle to you.


Let us go.


You are now serving Seo Yul


instead of Jang Uk.


Had I competed and b*at Uk,


you would have served me instead.


Had you competed instead,


there would have been no chance


of you becoming my owner.


I would have let him win out of pity.


Do you not pity him?


Everyone in Songrim knows


that Uk is practicing chastity.


-Right?


-Do not feign ignorance.


You must know best.


Are you not the one who serves him


the chaste herb tea every day?


I have never done that.


How else did he reach Chisu so quickly?


He is not even Jang g*ng's real son.


His mother married into the Jang family


and gave birth to an illegitimate son.


Now, her son will end


his family's line for good.


His father blocked his gate of energy


so Uk would not carry on the family line.


But he managed to open it again,


so he should at least be chaste.


That is true.


You are obnoxious and despicable.


What?


What did you just say?


-You heard me.


-How dare you?


-Say it again.


-Then you will hit me.


Tell me this instant!


Tell them.


If they must hear it,


make sure you tell them loud and clear.


You are obnoxious and despicable!


That is what she said. Did you get that?


-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Mu-deok, I had given you something.


Show them.


I had bestowed that sachet to you.


If someone hits, swears,


or mistreats you while I am not around,


you must tell me.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


You may go.


It is foolish of you to make an enemy


of someone so powerful out of jealousy.


You have ink on your shoulder.


You can erase that black ink


with white rice.


The two colors may contrast one another.


But mix them together,


and they will get rid of that stain.


Those were some wise words.


Where did you read that,


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness?


Somewhere.


It is something you may see


on a highly competitive exam.


Is my young master not here?


I heard you were injured.


Are you better now?


Yes, thanks to you.


Thank you for sending me the medicine.


Maidservant Kim invited me over


for dinner recently.


Can you join us?


Sure.


Then I will set a date and tell Mu-deok.


Do you know my maid?


There was a time


when I visited you but left


without being able to see you.


That day, she was in your room.


Do not go.


Do not go to your room and just stay here.


I will bring you your clothes.


What was that?


Was she making a move on me?


What do you mean?


It is nothing.


Wait.


Stay still.


It left.


-Did it?


-Yes.


-It has left.


-I was so startled.


Mu-deok.


Mu-deok, we meet again.


Take care of yourself.


I will see you at the palace.


Right.


What is it? Did you run here?


I did.


It took you long enough to visit me


after learning that I was hurt.


What is it?


What could be more shocking


than serving someone else?


It is not that.


The other mages were gossiping about you.


I wanted to know the truth.


I see. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you heard about it as well.


Why rush over


when you know it is not true?


Who knows? You even caught


a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Golden</span> Fish while I was away.


You could have become


Master Lee's pupil for all I know.


What? That is definitely not true.


Forget it.


I even suggested it to you.


I guess it cannot be helped.


How can I prove it to you?


You said it could not be helped.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>?


I am not a woman to you.


If you want to prove it,


go embrace that pretty lady.


Then should I really do it?


Yes. Do it.


You better not say otherwise.


Fine, do it!


You told me to att*ck


when my opponent least expects it.


I have followed your teachings, my master.


Fine. Well done. I am proud of you.


By the way,


I heard you ran into her


in my room last time.


What about it?


Is that why you stopped me from going?


Did that happen?


I do not remember.


Understanding you is much harder


than controlling


Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's energy.


You were pulling me in, were you not?


Master, I am going to the palace today.


The <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">King</span> invited Master Lee,


and I will be accompanying him.


I had wanted to see the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span>


once again and it worked out.


Be safe.


I will. I will tell you everything


once I return.


Uk.


I found this.


I just so happened to find it.


I thought I should tell you.


Go.


Why would the leader of Songrim


look for me?


-Do you remember Mu-deok?


-Yes.


He wants to know


about her time in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village.


He could just ask her directly. Why me?


She is here.


She is not. She is in Songrim.


She is?


What could a blind girl be doing there?


Master Lee wanted you two and Jang Uk


to accompany him to the palace.


Uk too?


Is he all better now?


We need to leave right away. Get ready.


Please be careful at the palace.


The ice stone is there.


I am aware of that.


Since they are shamelessly hiding it,


I have decided to be brazen


as well and make my move.


The last time I was invited to the palace,


you were this little.


I remember enjoying the candies


you had brought from there.


By the way,


should you not prepare


a gift for His Majesty?


I have prepared one already.


Yeom.


Send the gift over to the palace on time.


Yes, master.


Was it between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.?


Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., you fool.


Right. I am sorry.


Write it down so you will not forget.


You used to be easily distracted.


Now that you have aged,


you have become forgetful as well.


Let us go.


-Goodbye, master.


-Goodbye, master.


I just cannot get used to seeing that.


Mu-deok.


The leader would like to see you.


The leader?


Mu-deok.


Everything about you


has been exposed by this man over here.


I told him about your eyes.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> my cover get blown?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lord, you see…


She was not the only one who lied.


Her grandmother begged me,


so I played along with it.


Her family has always been poor.


She lied about being blind


to avoid getting sold off to pay the debt.


It is something like


those who pretend to limp


to avoid fighting at w*r.


Why did you lie about being blind


when you were sold off to Chwiseonru?


She was planning to run away.


Sure, she was sold off due to the debt.


But it would have been easier


to run away if she pretended to be blind.


-Right?


-That is correct.


I was on the run


when I first met Young Master Jang.


He took pity and took me in.


I am sorry for lying, my lord.


What I did was wrong.


Other than lying about that,


she has never done anything wrong.


She has always been


a great granddaughter and a kind girl.


Why did you lie for me?


I just did my money's worth.


Your money's worth?


But are you really not blind?


But then again,


I did find it odd from the beginning.


-What?


-Despite being blind,


you always recognized


whoever was in front of you.


You even knew


whether it would snow or rain.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Many</span> villagers thought


you were lying about being blind.


They were creeped out and avoided you.


-I see.


-Anyway,


come to the ferry inn


if you ever need my help again.


All right?


Right.


Did you meet with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i?


She is in the capital right now.


Some thugs were looking for her.


I wonder what she did this time.


She was the one who robbed your house


after your grandmother passed away.


Do not get involved with her.


It seems you are also hiding things


Songrim does not know.


You said you did your money's worth.


Who paid you?


Ju-wol.


You do not need to thank me.


It was Young Master Jang's money.


If anyone asks or seeks Mu-deok,


use this money.


And of course, half of it is yours.


I was not hiding something heinous either.


I got my share as well.


And I like you.


I am truly grateful.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what really happened to your eyes?


Forget it.


You must have your reasons.


Had Uk not taken any measures beforehand,


Park <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jin</span> would have found out.


If I get caught,


I will be putting Uk in danger as well.


Welcome, Master Lee Cheol.


I am grateful


for your invitation, Your Majesty.


Did that wench Shaman Choi


tell you to k*ll me?


Shaman Choi.


Could that be who the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> really is?


Mu-deok.


That <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-i you were talking about.


It could have been her who came by


looking for you a few days ago.


I heard she was dangerous, so be careful.


I will not be able to recognize her


since I do not know her face.


Should I have asked that man for details?


Come to the ferry inn


if you ever need my help again.


Ferry inn.


Everything about you


has been exposed by this man over here.


Is Broker Kim from <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sari</span> Village here?


Yes, he just arrived.


He is in the last room


on the second floor.


Mister, it is me, Mu-deok.


Mister.


Master Lee.


If you were Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,


you must be well over a century old.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> how do you maintain


such a youthful appearance?


How old do I look, Your Majesty?


You look like


you are in your mid-thirties.


At most, forty years old.


You are right. That is my biological age.


What?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> soul is over a century old.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> body from birth


had turned into ashes long ago.


This body did not originally belong to me.


Wait.


Does that mean you have switched bodies?


That is correct.


I am a soul shifter.


Your Majesty.


Did you not summon me today


to find the soul shifter?


I will do just that.


I can recognize soul shifters.


He knew from the beginning


that Mu-deok was a soul shifter.


You must be the one


who k*lled him.


Subtitle translation by: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Soo</span>-ji Kim


ALCHEMY OF SOULS


What were all those bodies?


What kind of life has Mu-deok led?


Mu-deok is hiding something


-that must not be revealed.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness!


Instead, it will let you know by barking.


As expected, there are


more soul shifters within the palace.


If it is revealed that <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">King</span>'s <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Star</span>


was created by sorcery,


it will spell the end of Songrim.


It is dangerous.


You may not know her,


but she knows who Mu-deok is.


We need Jang g*ng.


We will have to wait


until he returns of his own accord.


Mu-deok, what are you doing here?


I cannot leave Young Master Jang.


Keep loving me to death.<br />
<br />
<@#<b>(Japan)Crash landing on You--Episode 13 Transcript.txt</b>#@><br />
﻿I told you not to come.


I don't want you to see my face.


Next year,


the year after that,


and even the one after that


will all be good.


Because I'll be thinking about you.


I'll be grateful that you were born
into this world.


I'll be grateful


that the person I love is still breathing.


That's why your birthday


will always be a good day.


I thought you had left.


Are you planning to cry like that
once I leave?


No one plans to cry.


Tears come unexpectedly.


I don't want you to cry alone.


Since I cried today, I won't do it again.


I got vaccinated just now.


I heard


by chance.


Stop making things


hard for your father


and go back.


I will take care of that matter.


There is something called
the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Bambi</span> Syndrome.


When a baby deer


meets people in the mountains,


people pet it saying it's so cute.


But once people leave,


the baby deer


can't go back to its family.


Due to the smell


of people on its body,


its family


rejects it.


The baby deer
that is rejected from its group


dies in the end.


Are you worried


that I will be rejected and abandoned


by my group?


I will protect myself.


Believe in me.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> my world,


I will use my status, people, money,
and everything else.


Cho Cheol g*ng...


No.


No one will be able


to take me down.


Believe in me...


and go back, Jeong Hyeok.


Go back to your world.


Wasn't it the first time she cried?


You are right.


Even when she crossed the ceasefire line,
she didn't cry.


Even when she got caught
on the smuggling boat, she didn't cry.


And even when she failed to escape
through the airport,


she didn't cry.


Just how much did you listen in on us?


Why aren't they coming back?


I hope the two of them just run away!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t say something so dangerous.


m*llitary World Games will be over
in a few days.


We must go back with Jeong Hyeok
before then.


I am sorry.


She didn't even blink
when I told her that I will bury her.


Seeing her cry so suddenly


got me flustered.


I will go out for a second.


-What are you doing outside?
-I was worried.


Are you okay?


I am okay.


-Let's go inside.
-Okay.


Everyone is worried and waiting for you.


I got startled because I didn't expect
such an event.


-I am sorry.
-<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t be.


Were you guys worried about me?


Gosh, no one worried about you.


Pyo Chi <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Su</span>, I didn't expect anything
from you.


Who chose this cake?


Where did you get
such an old-fashioned cake?


-Let's light the candles.
-Okay.


I have only seen this in a drama.


This is my first time
to light candles on a cake.


Let's turn off the light.


All right.


Let's begin.


-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday


-Take this bouquet of flowers
-Take this bouquet of flowers


-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday


-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you


One more time!


-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday


-Take our blessings
-Take our blessings


-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday


-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you


-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.


I never thought I would hear
the North Korean birthday song.


You know that you need to make a wish


before you blow out the candles, right?


Didn't you know?


I am teaching you so many things.


All right. Close your eyes


and wish for what you want the most.


You blow out the candles after that,


and your wish will come true.


Did you finish making a wish?


Let's blow out the candles.


One, two, three.


Live a good life.


-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.


-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.


Thank you, everyone.


CRASH LANDING ON YOU


Come in.


I hope I didn't disturb your rest.


You didn't.


What brings you here?


What is it?


Do you have something for me?


Is it my birthday present?


It's a present,


but it's nothing big.


It doesn't matter. Let me see what it is.


Let me tell you in advance


that this isn't a token of anything.


You don't have to give it
a special meaning.


Okay. I won't do that.


I had to do something for your birthday
when I found out about it.


And I had a bit of free time,


so I bought it.


Although I bought it
without any thoughts...


If you think it's nothing,


you can pawn it.


Are you sweating?


It's hot in here.


Give it to me. Is this your first time
to give a present to a woman?


Why are you so nervous?


It's a ring.


It should fit.


It fits perfectly on my thumb.


That one is mine.


What?


Are these couple's rings?


Is it your first time
to receive a present from a man?


You shouldn't have taken it away from me.
Had you waited a little,


I would have put it on your finger.


Gosh,


when you said you hadn't dated anyone,


I think you were kidding.


Tell me.


Where did you learn this?


Where did you learn
to make a woman's heart flutter?


Give it to me.


Let me do it for you too.


Thank you.


It's the prettiest ring I have ever seen.


I won't take it off
for the rest of my life.


I won't mind if you do.


No matter what happens,


I will remember you.


I can't go further
because the road is blocked.


You can't go further? Here, take it.


Why is the road blocked?


For goodness' sake.


-For goodness' sake.
-The hour is late,


so I didn't expect to see you.


-Have you been well?
-Sure.


I'm glad you're here. There are
many questions I've wanted to ask you.


-Pardon?
-The house was ready quite a while ago,


but why are the newlyweds
nowhere to be seen?


As you know,


Jeong Hyeok has an emergency
at the outpost line.


Right?


It's just that


I saw a strange man go into the house.


As the people's president
of this neighborhood,


I was thinking
that maybe I should make a visit.


I should have given this to you earlier.
Happy New Year.


-You shouldn't have.
-You shouldn't have.


That strange man you saw is my nephew.


His name is <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Alberto</span>.


Alber...


He recently came back from Europe
when he received the country's calling.


I told him to stay in Pyongyang,


but he insisted upon staying here
because he missed the countryside.


-I see.
-Yes.


The air quality is better here.


Yes.


Then, see you again.


She seems to be in a hurry.


She seems to be in a great hurry.


I think she was lying
when she said he is her nephew.


I agree.


Is Dan having an affair?


It will be a bloodbath.


Hello.


-Comrade <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Al</span>.
-That's right. I am Comrade <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Al</span>.


We have met before, Mother.


-Mother?
-I was thinking


about visiting you in Pyongyang.


-Me?
-Of course.


I am honored that
you've come all the way here in person.


-Dan is here, right?
-Yes.


She is here,


but she drank vodka until sunrise
and passed out.


Again?


I was about to wake her up


and make her eat some pollack soup.


Is that so?


Could it be that


Dan slept here without telling you?


Her cell phone was off all day.


Gosh, you must have been startled.


I was a bit startled, but...


I will apologize to you in her stead,


so please don't scold Dan too much.


-Where in the world is Dan?
-She is in this room.


-This room?
-Yes.


For goodness' sake. I can't believe her.


Wake up right this instant!


What do you think you are doing?


Mother, you haven't had dinner yet, right?


Please come on out and eat.


All of these side dishes look familiar.


I think they were in my fridge
until yesterday.


Every table needs candlelight.


I heard that you are a British citizen.


What do your parents do?


-Mom.
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> father used to run a business.


He passed away a long time ago, though.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother remarried,


and I haven't seen her in years.


Is that so?


What kind of relationship
do you have with Dan?


I have a crush on Dan.


I know that she likes


and is engaged to another man.


Why do you like


Dan?


Her disciplined sternness


and noble elegance that comes from it.


Her confidence and grace
which make her strong before anyone.


All of those are the reasons.


I think they were passed down
from her mother's side.


I like him.


He figured out
that your elegance comes from me.


He is a wise man


who has an eye for people.


We don't have that kind of relationship.


But he carried you home on his back,


and you spent the night with him
at the apartment I got you.


I told you, didn't I?


I only let him stay over
because of some situation.


Then when Jeong Hyeok returns
from the outpost line,


-will you marry him as planned?
-Why wouldn't I?


I am Jeong Hyeok's fiancée.


JURI MOTEL


It's you.


-Who are you?
-I think you know.


I remember. We talked on the phone,
Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok.


Instead of showing up to an appointment,
you sent someone else.


I had an emergency that day.


I shouldn't have done that.
I did you a disservice. I am sorry.


Gu Seung-jun told me


that you are a talented broker,
but I should never trust you.


Given the nature of the job,
I connect people,


but I'm not necessarily loyal to them.


You don't need to be loyal to me.


Just answer the questions I ask.


I have a question.


It seems like the m*llitary World Games
will end in five days.


Does the team's bus return that day?


Yes.


We need to get on that bus no matter what.


I see.


And it would be the safest for Jeong Hyeok
to take that bus.


His father took measures
despite the danger.


But if he doesn't go back then,
he won't be safe anymore.


It won't do if he fails to go back.


He must go back


no matter what.


She told you not to come?


That's right. She said
she will do the housekeeping for now,


so I haven't gone to her place
for two weeks.


Are you saying


Yoon Se-ri does the laundry
and cleans the house


without a housemaid?


a*t*matic


Se-ri, what are you doing?


I am cleaning.


With that?


There are so many interesting things
in South Korea.


I would buy everything
if only you could take them back.


This is like a magical pass.


People usually call it M.C.


-What's that?
-Mom's card.


Since this is Se-ri's card,
let's call it S.C.


Get to the point.
What do you want us to do with it?


S.C. is a card with no spending limit.


You can buy anything you want with it.


Really?


You have no fear.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t you believe me when I tell you
that I will make you a beggar


-in your later years?
-No.


Go ahead and spend all of my fortunes.


Do something about your clothes.


Pyo Chi <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Su</span>, you are the worst.


This is driving me crazy.


You guys are like fashion t*rrorists.


t*rrorists? Who do you think we are?


-We aren't t*rrorists.
-We aren't like that.


Fashion t*rrorists have nothing to do
with an actual terror att*ck.


It means that you have
no sense of fashion.


Really?


We do have a sense of fashion!


No, you don't. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> do your best.


Before you leave,


I want to give you a present.


Buy everything you've wanted to get, eat,


and wear so far.


Make sure you do that.


Chi <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Su</span>.


Upon a glimpse, South Korea seems to be
a wealthy country.


But the marketplace reveals the truth.


Look at these pants.
They are ripped up like a rag.


They should have patched them up
before selling them.


I think people wear such jeans for style.


Style, my foot! Your knees will get cold.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness.


Give me the same pair of jeans.


Do you like it?


Buy it in every color.


Buy ten of it.


Can I really do that?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> siblings will love it.


Of course.


One costs...


Five thousand won?


It's not cheap, but...


Forget it. Buy everything.


Are there clothes you like?


There are so many clothes
that I don't know what to pick.


This is...


the only thing I need.


-How does it move?
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness.


You know


Tonight


I am the same as always


Thoughts of you


What are they doing?


I think they are beggars.


I knew it.


There are beggars everywhere.


I want those clothes.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> secret


Hey.


Let's talk about changing
the chairwoman of Se-ri's Choice


once more.


That item was rejected
after Chairwoman Yoon came back.


What if


Chairwoman Yoon has major faults


that keep her from running the company?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t you want to know
where Chairwoman Yoon was


while she was missing?


You want to backstab her
as soon as she comes back alive.


You are one impressive woman.


I am working hard
to make your son successful.


If you make me a bitch,
I will be disappointed.


No mother would sacrifice her daughter
to make her son successful.


I know where Se-ri has been,


and the fact that you and Se-hyeong
stopped her from escaping sooner.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> husband knows as well.


Se-hyeong is in Hong Kong for work, right?


Tell him to come back right away.
Come to the house with him.


Last night, Cha Sang-u posted something


that was clearly meant for you
on his social media account.


Look at this.


It must be about another woman.


"I am glad you are back safely.
Shall we go out again?


It's a.m.
and alcohol is making me honest."


It's clearly and definitely a message
for you.


Why are you making a fuss
about a drunk man's words?


Stop and...


But reporters keep asking us
if he and you will get back together.


Get back together, my foot!


It has happened before.


Was it when she dated <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Shin</span> Yeong-woong?


No, it was when she dated
that idol singer, Won <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-hun.


They dated on and off.


-It was a total mess.
-Seriously.


Stop!


I have so much work


and absolutely no time
for this useless babbling.


Hurry up and get back to your work.


Yes, ma'am.


Lee Hyeok, what are you doing?


Come on.


No. Hyeok stays.


-What?
-I have


important and secret orders for him.


-Hurry up and get out.
-Okay.


I guess you weren't lying when you said
you'd go back and date men.


Those men just passed
through my life briefly.


Is that so?


Yes, it is.


Am I passing through your life?


Tell me if it happened already.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness.


Little Hyeoky, are you jealous?


No!


Whose fault do you think it is?


Are you saying it's my fault?


You should have shown up sooner
in my life.


How was I supposed to do that
with the ceasefire line between us?


That's why I am so understanding.


It's a sad history,
not your personal fault.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> any case, it was hard for me too.


"Is he the one?" Then he wasn't the one.


"Is he the one?"
Then he wasn't the one either.


Since my fated one was in North Korea,
I kept breaking up with men.


It was so exhausting and stressful.


Since we met each other
after many twists and turns,


why don't we bunk off?


Are you up for it?


Are you satisfied
that you bunked off today?


The day you spend after bunking off
is never satisfactory.


Since it always happens without a plan,


you can't do much despite the will.


But it's memorable


even if you don't do much.


Have you ever bunked off before?


-Yes.
-What did you do?


I didn't do much too.


I skipped my class
and went outside to take photos.


Then I saw someone
who was thinking about jumping off


a tall bridge.


Who?


She was a woman. She was my type.


I see why you said
such days are memorable.


I asked her to take a picture of me.


Stop it. You don't need to give me
the details.


She asked me if she must take it
at such a scary place.


With trembling hands, she took the camera.


Could you take a picture of us?


Okay.


Give me the camera.


Where is that?


Switzerland.


On Panorama Bridge Sigriswil.


That woman was quite memorable.


Even after that, I wondered


if she was doing all right


and if she would do anything bad


every now and then.


Because she was my type.


Then...


the woman next to you was


Ms. Seo Dan?


You said I could do better than her.


I wonder...


how many times we have met.


I am


very happy now.


They say


one sees the flashback
of the best moments in their life


for a moment


before they die.


I think this will be


one of those moments.


We should win, right?


-What the...
-Look at him.


-Oh, come on!
-What was that?


-What are you doing?
-Hey!


What's with all the fuss?


They're watching a soccer game.


What an ultimate entertainment.


It's an international competition.


Hey, who cares
about international competitions?


-Chi <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Su</span> is right.
-Right.


We must focus on our mission,
which is to send Captain Ri


safely back home, and go back home.


-But it's a match between Korea and Japan.
-What?


JAPAN: , KOREA:


Go, go!


-Keep going!
-Just go!


-Run!
-Run!


-Run!
-Run faster!


-Go!
-sh**t!


Captain Ri!


Se-ri!


-Korea for the win!
-Korea for the win!


-Republic of Korea!
-Republic of Korea!


-Republic of Korea!
-Republic of Korea!


-Republic of Korea!
-Republic of Korea!


-There you go.
-Go!


-Oh, come on!
-It was so close!


-Good. Keep going.
-Go, go!


-Go!
-Keep running!


-Go!
-sh**t!


-Cheers.
-Let's drink.


That was great.


I'm paying for all the chickens today.


Yangsongi beoseot.


Why do you always say words
that end with seot?


Damn it.


Drink it up.


Drink up.


-Hurry and drink up
-Hurry and drink up


-Drink it up now
-Drink it up now


If you don't, you're a coward
If you drink it, you are a hero


One more time!


-Hurry and drink up
-Hurry and drink up


-Drink it up now
-Drink it up now


If you don't, you're a coward
If you drink it, you are a hero


Thank you...


It's even nicer to see you out here.


When I found out that you betrayed me,
I got angry at first.


But I understood.


One can't only live off
the same food all the time.


However, you must face the reality.


Do you think


the Director of the GPB will protect you
when you get back?


After all, you're the person
who k*lled his eldest son.


After being used, you will be abandoned.


Was it the Director of the GPB
that has been providing for your family?


Was it Ri Jeong Hyeok who freed
your old mother from the prison?


Could you please just
turn a blind eye to me?


I would like to pay for what I did


to Ri Mu Hyeok.


Paying your debt to a dead man or...


saving your only child's life.
What's your choice?


What do you mean?


It's U Pil from this morning.


Sir.


Loyalty and Justice.
They're all good. But,


the reason I don't pursue them is
not because I don't know they're good.


Rather than those fancy ideas,


I choose to protect my family and my kids.
That's why.


Who can blame that?


And I used to be a child beggar
who was born on the street.


I have no one to protect
and nothing to fear.


That's why I can risk everything
and just go for it.


If I catch Ri Jeong Hyeok here
and take Yoon Se-ri back home,


I can go up to a higher position.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>...


make your decision.


Comrade.


I think it's better
that you sleep up here.


I said I'm fine. Enjoy your bed.


Thank you, Sir.


Before you guys met us,
you slept in a sauna?


Yes.


But that place was really great too.


There are so many interesting things
in South Korea.


What else was interesting?


I went to a place called internet cafe
with Ju Meok.


I did this thing called computer game
for the first time.


You played a computer game too.


Well, it's a good experience to have
at your age.


At first,


I saw the amateurs sh**ting r*fles
like children.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I thought, "I will show them
how to do it," and started to play.


But it was harder than I'd thought.


It's not as easy as it looks.


That's right.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I studied the features
of the weapons and armors I had.


But then some South Korean punk


armed with expensive gears showed up
and messed up everything.


Oh, no.


I got angry and said,
"Stop hiding behind the computer.


Let me see your face."


-And?
-He didn't show up.


After all, he was one of those typical
rich and cowardly capitalist bluffers.


That stupid Tomato Cultivator.


What was your name in the game?


It was Desperate Effort.


-I see.
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I--


Why don't you stop talking
and go to bed now? It's late.


Where are you going?


To get some water.


Sleep tight.


What's wrong?


If you're hungry...


No, I'm not.


Is it because you miss your family?


You will soon be able to see them again.


This is all because of me. I'm sorry.


IGNORANCE IS DARKNESS!


We have been thinking


if there is any way
we could help you, Yeong Ae.


And Myeong <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sun</span>
has something to say to you.


-What is it?
-I can't reach my husband


who went on a long-term business trip.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I went to his close friends


and asked them some questions.


Friends, you mean by the wiretappers?


Yes.


You know how good wiretappers are.


There's nothing they don't know
about our village.


You're right.


Yes.


Then what did his friends


say to you?


They said the incident
the Senior Colonel was involved


happened because


Lieutenant Commander Cho Cheol g*ng


tried to dig up dirt
on the Director of the GPB.


-Oh, my. Yeong Ae.
-Goodness.


How dare he tried to mess up
with such a high-ranking official.


Cho Cheol g*ng must have been
k*lled secretly.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness.


Why does Ri Jeong Hyeok happen to be


at the frontline now of all times?


I know!


It might not be the direct way


to the Director of the GPB,


I know a detour nearby.


-What?
-The Director of the GPB's


-future daughter-in-law's mother's...
-Yes?


nephew who used to live in Europe.


What?


Goodness. I can't believe I took a bath
with the water boiled in a cauldron.


Now I have done everything.


Comrade Nephew from Europe,
are you in there?


Please open the door.


Maybe he's not in there.


Yes, he is.


He's in there.


We just saw the cauldron's steam


coming out of this apartment.


There was steam indeed.


Right?


Keep knocking.


Open the door.


We can unlock the door if we want.


But that's illegal.


-What's up?
-It's Dan.


Well, as the President of the village,
I just wanted to check--


Please come in.


-"Come in"?
-Okay.


Oh, my goodness.


Hey.


Hello.


Looks like I have many visitors.


Oh, my. I'm sorry
that we all suddenly have showed up.


Hopefully we didn't
make you feel uncomfortable.


I feel uncomfortable.


Yeong Ae, isn't it great?


We came to meet the Director of the GPB's
daughter-in-law's mother's


nephew who used to live in Europe.


But we happened to meet
his future daughter-in-law.


What's your business?


This is


what I got from my mother-in-law.


I have been treasuring it dearly.


Then keep treasuring it dearly.


As a matter of fact,


my husband is imprisoned
by the State Security Department.


Could you put in a word for him
to the Director of the GPB,


who will be your father-in-law?


I don't accept personal requests.


Is there anything else you want to say?


Come on, Dan.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t be so uptight.


She might sound cold
as the cold wind in the winter,


but her heart is warm
like a spring breeze.


Please leave the name of your husband.


I will put in a good word for him
with my aunt.


Oh, my. Comrade Nephew from Europe


can talk sense, right?


Please take good care of it.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t you worry.


By the way, I feel like
I have seen you before.


Me?


I saw you coming out
of Captain Ri's house the other day.


-Is that true?
-Yes.


I sent him on an errand.


I needed to pick up something.


-I see.
-I see.


That's right.


Goodness. I'm finally outside.
It's all thanks to you.


I have been staying home
these last few days and it was hard.


Tell me.


Why did you go to Jeong Hyeok's place?


You know Jeong Hyeok is at the frontline.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t you think of lying to me.


I don't lie to you, Dan. I decided not to.


The thing is...


Ri Jeong Hyeok contacted me
from the frontline.


Why?


Cho Cheol g*ng didn't die
while being transported.


He disappeared.


He went to South Korea.
He wants to bring Se-ri back


and destroy Ri Jeong Hyeok's family.


And?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> Ri Jeong Hyeok...


went to Seoul.


To save Se-ri and catch Cho Cheol g*ng.


He didn't want to trouble
people around him,


so he didn't tell anyone about it
and asked me favors.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I ran some errands
and set him up with some people.


I'm not sure why I did that, but...


Dan.


Are you okay?


Dan. I'm sorry.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t cry--


All right. Tell me what you found out.


Myeong <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eun</span>.


There is good news and bad news.


What would you like to hear first?


No funny business, you punk.
Just tell me already.


First, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Alberto</span> Gu


is indeed a businessman from the UK.


He owns international businesses


all over the world.


-What's the bad news?
-This is the bad news.


What are you saying?


The Director of the GPB recently
tracked down


illegal businesses on a large scale.


He tracked down smugglers, drug dealers,


and those who got paid
for hiding criminals.


Were you all right?


Of course. Thanks to your wealth,


I have never been interested in money.


-And?
-There's a British business man


who is involved in the incident.


And that's <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Alberto</span> Gu.


What the...


What?


The State Security Department
is looking for him.


Apparently, he swindled
a lot of money in South Korea


and escaped to our country.


Then what's the good news?


-Right. The good news is...
-Yes?


Dan seems to know about this.


-What?
-She knew it from the first place.


It means


Dan didn't fall for a swindler at least.


You lunatic.


How is that good news?


What's wrong with you?


What's wrong? Why do you always hit me?


-What is it that I did wrong?
-You punk!


What are you doing?


I will send Ju Meok on an errand later,
and I want him to look pretty.


Ju Meok, you can remove it now.


What errand?


He will look
like a very sophisticated South Korean


and pick up something.


I would make a sophisticated South Korean
very well.


Yesterday, I was standing
at an intersection,


and people asked me directions.


They thought I was from Seoul.


That's not it.


Ju Meok, I think you should get changed


before you go.


What? I need to get changed?


Yes. Here, we don't wear just anything


when we run errands.


-Oh, my.
-You look gorgeous.


You look great.


It suits you very well.


-Does it?
-Yes.


Do South Koreans really dress like that
when they run errands?


Yes, we do. I told you.


Se-ri usually doesn't ask me
favors like this,


but she said she really would like me
to do this favor.


She said you were one of the people


she likes the most.


She told me you came from
somewhere really far away to see me.


Thank you.


Not at all.


If there's anything you'd like to say,
feel free to do so.


You said


those who love each other


will always meet again.


No matter...


how far you are...


You'll always come back to each other.


Yes. That's right.


True love will always return.


-Where's Ju Meok?
-He said he's not hungry.


Why not?


He refuses to eat anything
on top of the sacred meal he had


with Actress Choi <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-woo.


Ju Meok, let's meet again.


Okay, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-woo.


Let's meet again.


But the only way to do that
is through unification.


Did you do your errand well?


-Se-ri, you totally duped me.
-Let me see.


How did you deceive me so easily?


Didn't you see me doing this


earlier in the morning?


Do South Koreans really dress like that


when they run errands?


Yes, we do. I told you.


What is that?


Cross my finger.


The American imperialism does this


as a way of declaring that they will lie.


That's right. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> even though I did lie,


God would've forgiven me.


How are you so tolerant of yourself?


Thank you so much.


You made my lifetime dream come true.


I'd have no regrets even if I d*ed today.


You got the award you deserved.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> for K-drama Award.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eun</span> Dong, you received
the Hospitality Award.


And...


Chi <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Su</span>, you received
the Fragrant Scalp Award.


Are we saying our goodbyes once again?


Yes.


Why do we keep saying goodbye?


Who knows? This may not be our last.


Even still, we should say our goodbyes
in advance when we can.


By the way, I gave you my card
so that you could splurge,


but you didn't spend much.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I prepared a gift for each of you.


Are you all ready to leave?


-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.


They'll be sending us another bus


so that the other athletes won't notice.


Aren't you coming with us?


A man who goes by Manager Oh
will contact me.


You can go first.


I'll join you once I'm done.


Good work.


Now I'll lure Ri Jeong Hyeok


through Manager Oh.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> the meantime, act normally


and report
Jeong Hyeok and Se-ri's whereabouts.


Oh, my.


I think something broke.


That's understandable.


Hold my hand, will you?


All right.


Father.


Do you even know how old that is?


You can't destroy them like this--


What did you say?


You should've told me the truth


when you had the chance.


Father!


Are you going to believe these men
whom you've never met


or me, your son?


I trusted you.


Then please keep doing so.


-It's a misunderstanding.
-Shut up!


Why do you think I appointed you
to that position?


Because you're competent?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t be ridiculous!


It was because
you were the most incompetent.


You're a doormat to your wife
and was conned so easily.


I thought if you were aware
of how much you lacked,


you'd ask others for help
instead of keeping everything to yourself.


I thought you'd do that.


That was why I gave you that position.


Are you saying the reason
you picked me among my siblings


was because I lacked the most?


I was aware of that, but I had no idea
how much you had lacked!


I made a mistake.


I'm going to hold
a general meeting of stockholders soon.


Just accept your fate
and get ready to be demoted.


Why are you doing this?


Father, I fully understand
why you're so upset.


Please forgive us
for not telling you earlier.


Get up.


I don't want to see either one of you,
so get out!


Please take a look at this.


You can make your decision afterward.


That's Gu Seung-jun.


He and Se-ri were hiding together
up North.


Do you really think it was coincidental?


This is something we recently found out
while investigating.


Do you remember Gu Myeong-su,
the president of Guryong Corporation,


whose company you forcefully
took over years ago?


Seung-jun is his son.


He had disguised himself
and approached our family on purpose.


What?


We had to confirm this


before telling you.


We apologize.


Father, to be honest,


all kinds of thoughts ran through my head.


"Why were they spotted together
in North Korea


when they had called off their marriage?


Is the money he stole related to Se-ri?"


But first, I told him
to send her back home.


That's when he told me


to give up half the money
that was scammed.


But what could I do?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> first priority was to bring Se-ri back.


Is that so?


I'll have to verify


if you're still lying to me


or if Se-ri really did that.


If I find out that you lied once again,


not only will you lose your position


but everything that you currently have.


Call her.


I have nothing to say to you.


I feel the same way.


Father called for you,
so hurry up and come.


Mom's not doing too well either.


What's wrong? Is it because
of her low blood pressure?


It's all because of you.


Were you ever helpful to our family?


Tell him I'll be on my way soon.


The recording has ended.


That's the route she takes to come here.


She drives the car herself,


so do as you wish.


Does that mean


you don't care whether I abduct


or k*ll her?


You can do whatever you want
to do with her.


I just don't want her around me.


That's all.


Then I better get ready.


Se-ri


just left.


We'll be leaving soon as well.


NORTH KOREAN ATHLETICS TEAM


NO ENTRY


Jeong Hyeok should be here soon.


Now that he'll arrive soon,


I think I'm done with my job.
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">May</span> I go now?


Not yet.


Once I k*ll him


and get on the boat with Se-ri,


that's when you'll be done with your job.


I've arranged the time and place,


and he'll arrive soon.
I think I'm done here.


There he is.


I knew it.


I knew you'd come.


You're not a coward


who'd leave Se-ri behind and return
to the North, knowing I'm still here.


You're right.


I have no plans
to leave my woman here all alone. No.


As long as a scumbag like you is here,


I didn't plan on going back.


Hey!


Man <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Bok</span>.


Do you have something to tell me?


If you do, please tell me.


All my life, I've been reporting things
that I've eavesdropped on.


But you're asking me to speak my mind.


Thank you.


I will


tell you what's on my mind.


I met with Cho Cheol g*ng today.


He threatened me with a photo of my child.


I'm terrified.


But I'm going to put up a fight this time.


Aren't you coming with us?


I need to stop by somewhere.


A man who goes by Manager Oh
will contact me.


You can go first.


I'll join you once I'm done.


Tell him I'll be on my way soon.


I want to believe


that my mom is sick
and everything my brother said.


Do you truly believe that my brother
has colluded with Cho Cheol g*ng


and schemed this?


We'll find out.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t look so frightened. It's unlike you.


What's there to be scared of
when we're here?


-He's right.
-He's right.


Se-ri


just left.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eun</span> Dong, how's it going?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t overdo it
and make yourself stop growing!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t worry. I'm doing fine.


What was that? He's really one of a kind.


Hey, be careful!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t worry.


We're from the special forces.


It's cold out here. Wait inside for a bit.


I hope they won't get hurt.


Hey, don't move, okay?


If you don't, I can hit you
every single time.


Are you all right?


-Yes.
-We're fine too.


Man <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Bok</span>.


You startled me.


All right. Let's go to the next place!


-All right!
-All right!


Hey, I'm serious! Be careful!


Are you sure we won't have to pay
the monthly rent for the next year?


You won't need to pay it for two years.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> march forward! Go!


-Let's go!
-Okay!


Captain Ri, we're here!


I see that you've made a decision.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I'll make mine.


Hey, hey, hey.


Hey, what are you doing?


sh**t.


Why can't you k*ll
someone as trivial as him?


You're so soft.


What?


What was that g*nsh*t?


What are they doing?


Hold on.


Who are they?


No.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t come this way.


Se-ri?


They say


one sees the flashback
of the best moments in their life


for a moment


before they die.


I think this will be


one of those moments.


Next year, the year after that,


and even the one after that


will all be good.


Because I'll be thinking about you.


I'll be grateful that you were born
into this world.


I'll be grateful


that the person I love is still breathing.


Jeong Hyeok.


To be honest,


what you had told me


was enough for me.


I got to enjoy


the happiness


that was given to me.


Se-ri...


Se-ri.


No.


You're wrong.


That wasn't enough.


I still have


more to say.


There's something I haven't told you.


I love you.


I love you, Se-ri.


Judging from what Man <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Bok</span> has told me,


you've crossed the line.


You won't solve this issue
by putting your life on the line.


That's what we're saying.


I'm sorry to all of you.


But I cannot go.


-Go first and--
-We just want you to put more on the line.


There's still more.


You have us.


We're from your troop.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> our current situation,
you're as important as our country for us.


Give us your orders.


-I cannot do that.
-Captain Ri.


Se-ri has become


a valuable friend to us as well.


Please give us your orders.


Master Sergeant Pyo.


Yes, sir.


First Lieutenant Park.


Yes, sir.


Staff Sergeant Kim.


-Yes, sir.
-Private First Class Geum.


Yes, sir.


Do everything in your power


to protect Se-ri.


That is all.


I trust you.


No.


No.


Please...


Please...


Please help us.<br />

﻿[deep breathing]


[heartbeat quickening]


[panting]


[door opens]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charlotte</span>] Viscount Bridgerton.


We thought perhaps
you'd not be joining us.


[Anthony] Your Majesty.


Nothing could keep me
from my beautiful bride.


[sighs deeply]


Now,


tell me of your wedding plan.


There is no talk
of a special license, I would hope.


- [laughter]
- Of course not, Your Majesty.


I believe a modest family affair
would be most fitting.


Perhaps back in the country,
at Aubrey Hall.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charlotte</span>] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> the country?


[laughs]


No, that will not do.


You must have it here in town.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> fact, I shall host the nuptials myself.


- [Mary gasps] Oh.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> laughs happily]


- That is most generous, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ma</span>'am.
- Most generous.


- But not at all necessary.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charlotte</span>] Nonsense.


She is my diamond, after all.


It is only right that I give you both
a wedding worthy of that title.


Besides, one could almost credit me myself


with bringing about
this most illustrious match.


I shall oversee every detail.


[quietly] Let that gossipmonger
try to get the better of me now.


Can you believe it, Didi?
It is like a fairytale come true.


[chuckles] You deserve nothing less, Bon.


Nothing less for a true love match.


[dishes clattering]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> apologies, Your Majesty.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Whistledown]
The frenzy of competition.


The thrilling delight
of hazarding your all.


I am referring not to the lure
of London's luxurious gaming halls


but to a gamble with far higher stakes.


Matrimony.


For once that particular wager is placed,


it cannot easily be undone.


A fact which, I am sure,


is met with both regret


and sheer relief.


...and I shall sing between each one.


For goodness' sake.


Anyone would think our siblings had beaten
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Napoleon</span> himself on the b*ttlefield


instead of finding someone with whom
to dutifully march down an aisle.


Indeed. With all the hubbub
about <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span>'s engagement,


my mama has rather forgotten I exist.


She is quite happy Cousin Jack
has ensured our family's future.


I must admit, so am I.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> laughs]


Mm. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t touch. You can look at it.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span> laughs]


And the baker is still awaiting payment.


As is, apparently, the coalman.


The new Lord Featherington was
supposed to restore our fortunes, and yet


here I am, unable to scratch together
sixpence yet again.


Our financial predicament is entirely
your doing, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Featherington.


If you hadn't forced me
into this ill-starred engagement,


we'd soon be living comfortably
on <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Cowper's ample dowry.


Oh, go on.
Blame me for taking you at your word


when you spoke
of your great fortune in rubies.


Had you thought to confide your plans,


then I would not be considering dismissing
the servants that I have just rehired.


All of that would be solved
if you would simply call off the wedding


and allow me to set my cap
at <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Cowper again.


And leave my poor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> jilted?


When her reputation's already
been called into question?


No, it is far too late for that, my lord.


No, you must continue in this engagement.


I will think of something.


Well, you'd better think fast.


You must be one of our new fellows.


Is it really so evident?


Conserve that youthful vigor.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Soon</span> you shall be
just as jaded as the rest of us.


After all, one form is much like another,


do you not think?


[lilting classical music plays]


It is not yet right.
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span> how the cuffs are an inch too short?


Very well, sir.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span>] Hmm.


There is plenty of time
to adjust it to your liking.


The wedding is not for another month.


- There is still much to do.
- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> live with us?


Indeed. After the wedding,


she'll be the lady of the house
and responsible for you all.


Lord, help her.


Which reminds me, our carriages
must be polished to a shine,


and the horses' manes braided.
We should bring out the finest silver.


The queen may be hosting
everything at the palace,


but we must be ready to entertain here.


And what of us, Brother? Should we also
be polished and braided for the big day?


[Anthony] We'll all be on display.


Perhaps you might even
scrub your hands for the occasion?


I've been occupied at the academy.


- What about <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s sister?
- What about her?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> she come to live with us, too?


Oh, I do hope so. It'll be a boon to have
another intelligent woman in the house.


Another? Mm. You're overcounting.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span>, I shall need your help today.


There is the dinner
to plan with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury


to welcome the Sharmas into the family.
And then the engagement ball next week...


I am sorry, Mama, but, uh,


I am attending a lecture
this afternoon. Flower arranging.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> chuckles]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span>'s mama is forcing her to go,


and you've wanted me
to find more ladylike pursuits.


[chuckles]


For how long have you cared
about flower arranging?


I am an open-minded woman.
I can care about many things.


I do wonder about the trim.
Is it too much?


Nothing is too much
now that the queen is hosting.


Let me show you the French tulle.


[quietly] Oh yes.


[exhales deeply]


[breathes deeply]


Did I tell you we will be married
by the archbishop himself?


Several times.


[sighs] We must find you a dress too.


- I have plenty of dresses.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] This one must be special.


After all, this wedding
is as much your triumph as mine.


Whatever you said
to the viscount at Aubrey Hall, Didi,


it clearly swayed him to declare himself.


I... [chuckles]


- I cannot claim credit.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] I shall bestow it, all the same.


It will be so exciting living in London.


The viscount said
there might even be snow this winter.


- Won't that be exciting?
- You must enjoy it without me, Bon.


Recall I am to set sail
soon after you wed.


But you will return to visit, of course.


[chuckles] And when the viscount
and I are blessed with children,


you shall be
their favorite aunt. [chuckles]


Think of us all together as a family.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> exhales]


I do not know why
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s betrothal is so special.


She's quite overshadowed my happy news.


A fact we may well be glad of.
Put those silks down.


Cotton will do for your trousseau.


Has my maid yet delivered that dress
that needs altering, Madame Delacroix?


[speaking French]


[chuckles]


[in English] I received your latest.
It's been a busy week, has it not?


Indeed.


The ton are quite ravenous
for news of the upcoming nuptials.


Perhaps <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Whistledown will report


that I have been entrusted
with our diamond's wedding ensemble.


Tell me, are my musings
not offering you sufficient business?


Indeed.


But why should there be limits
to a woman's ambitions?


I would think you,
of all people, would understand.


There is always more to be achieved.


Thank you, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Clara</span>. That will be all.


Lord Bridgerton?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


Lord Bridgerton and his guest are waiting.


I see that. Thank you.


This is the jeweler.


We are here to have <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s
betrothal ring altered to fit.


[chuckles softly] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> apologies,


but my sister and my mother
have not yet returned home.


Of course.
Then we shall trouble you no further.


Is that cake?


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] It is indeed.


- Lemon?
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] Pardon?


I fancy a good lemon. [chuckles]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> sighs deeply]


Might I offer you some refreshment, Mr...


Brookes. Only if you insist.
I mean, it would be churlish to refuse.


Tea, three spoons of sugar, and perhaps
some sandwiches too, thank you.


[dish clattering]


[Anthony breathes deeply]


[exhales]


It is fine weather
we are having, is it not?


You wish to speak to me of the weather?


Is there another topic of conversation
that'd be more appropriate?


[exhales sharply]
There is nothing appropriate


about what you're doing
proceeding with this engagement.


On the contrary, I believe it is
the most proper outcome for all.


Oh. And what of everything
that passed between us at Aubrey Hall?


[Anthony sighs]


Nothing passed between us.


I am a gentleman.


Is that so?


Need I remind you, sir,
if anyone other than your sister


discovered us in the library that night,
then we, too, would be obliged to wed.


Nothing happened.


Would the two of us being obliged to marry
be the outcome you desire?


Of course not.


Then let us both be... glad
we have avoided such an unthinkable fate.


[Mr. Brookes] I say, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma,


do you and your sister
happen to share gloves?


I...


Yes, on occasion.


I knew it.


I can take the measure
of a hand at paces.


We may use your finger to size the ring.


- Oh, I beg your pardo...
- That shan't be necessary.


[chuckling] Nonsense!


Thank you. [chuckles]


[sighs]


[slow classical music plays]


It is a beautiful piece.


It is the ring my father gave
to my mother before they were wed.


[footsteps approaching]


- Lord Bridgerton?
- They came to, uh, alter the ring.


Uh, Mr. Brookes insisted.


[sighs sharply] Just a moment.


It appears to be stuck.


- Well, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is here now.
- Yes.


- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>, are you...
- Yes, almost.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> grunts]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> sighs]


[grunts] Just, uh...


Just another... [grunts]


[chuckles] There.


- All yours.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury] Ah.


Here you all are.


I have news.


Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield sent word


they are in London.


Our grandparents?


Indeed. It seems they read
the engagement announcement


and wish to make your acquaintance.


And, uh, that of
your future husband, of course.


- I should be delighted to meet them.
- They are already in town?


They arrived... last night.


- [Anthony] Is something wrong?
- Not at all.


I shall invite them
to the engagement dinner tomorrow.


I'm sure it will be a most joyous reunion


after all these years.


Yes, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Mary?


Indeed.


- Hmm. I shall look forward to it.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury] Ah.


- Are you ready to promenade?
- I am, my lord.


I suddenly feel a headache coming on.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury, would you be so kind
as to chaperone my daughter?


Of course.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma and I
would be glad of the fresh air.


Oh, I should really stay with Mama.


You will escort me.


[sighs]


[indistinct chatter]


[children laughing]


Whoa!


[dog panting]


I wish you every happiness.


How could you invite
the Sheffields to dinner


when you know full well


the pain my mother has suffered
after their rejection of her?


Indeed. Which is why I shall not
answer their impoliteness with my own.


And besides, is this not
the reconciliation you wished for?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> returned
to the bosom of the Sheffield family


to reclaim the fortune
you so desperately need?


Yes, but not until after the wedding.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is still in the dark
about the conditions of their favor.


And if the Bridgertons
were to learn of it, they might feel...


As if you contrived a match
for your own concealed ends


and might call off the wedding?


I have to wonder if you might not secretly


rejoice were the viscount
to break the engagement.


Why would you ever say such a thing?


They are betrothed.


The viscount made a charming proposal,


your sister gave her giddy acceptance,


and in the eyes of society,
and, might I add,


the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> of England herself,
they are as good as wed.


Only a very great scandal


would prevent this marriage
from proceeding now.


The kind of scandal that would
send alarms through the entire ton


and be a stain from which
the penniless Sharma family


would never recover.


Only a fool
would jeopardize the marriage now.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I ask you,


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma,


are you that fool?


No.


I did not think so.


[Thomas] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.


Mr. Dorset.


- What a pleasure to see you here today.
- [chuckles]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma, perhaps you would be so kind


as to accompany me
on a turn around the lake?


I am rather tired.


She would be delighted.


You're still angry with me
over that business at the races.


I wish to apologize


and throw myself at your mercy.


Very well, my lord.
A turn would be most pleasant.


[chuckling and indistinct chatter]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] What a handsome couple they make.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span> chuckles]


Pardon me?


Mr. Dorset and my sister.


I noticed that he was quite smitten
with her the last time they met.


Perhaps he will convince her
to stay in England, after all.


She barely knows the gentleman.


Nor did I you, at first.


But love moves swiftly, does it not?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>,
you must tell me your favorite colors,


so I may plan to incorporate them


in the ornamentation
for your engagement ball.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>, fading] You are too kind,
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Bridgerton.


[slowed] I am certain
your taste is superb.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> laughing]


[laughter echoing]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span>] ...to honor both
Bridgerton and Sharma families,


now that we are to be joined.


[chuckles]


- [fading in] Is that not so, Anthony?
- [normal] Absolutely.


[chuckles]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> calling out]


Look at me!


Your sister seems... happy.


That is one way of putting it.


The new Lord Featherington
seems an interesting fellow.


A man of commerce, is he not?


Yes. He has ruby mines in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">America</span>.
They are flourishing, I hear.


Perhaps I should introduce myself.


After all, everyone else
is finding some purpose to their lives.


Anthony is to be married.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Benedict</span> has his artistic pursuits.


And, well,


here I am... feeding the ducks.


- [quacking]
- I am sure the ducks are most grateful.


You have a good deal of time and
plentiful opportunities to make your mark.


As <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> would no doubt remind me.


Where is your sister?
I have not seen her out today.


She mentioned something
about flower arranging


with you today, in fact.


Indeed. I am meeting her later.


- Mr. Bridgerton.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span>] Mm.


- [horse snorts]
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> grunts]


This is the place.


Doesn't look like
a place for shopping to me.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span>] I am collecting a unique gift


for my brother's wedding.


[woman] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span>? <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span>!


It is our right to be treated
not merely as chattels.


Surely talk of rights
must draw on Locke's Treatise.


You and your treatise!


If you've ever worked
an honest day's labor,


you know how little
such grand talk serves the working man.


Now, if I may be permitted to continue,


I should like to propose to this assembly


the radical idea
that it is not best for women to rely


for their education


on what falls to them by chance
from their husbands and brothers.


[crowd] Hear! Hear!


[crowd murmuring indistinctly]


Is it not thrilling?


You.


Me.


I told you, I don't know anything
about your Whistledown gossip.


It is not her I seek today,


but the exchange of ideas
with like-minded men and women


on subjects beyond
the trivial concerns of polite society.


Ideas that you yourself
invited me to consider.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, you're an admirer of my work?


I would not go so far.
It is serviceable, I suppose.


And yet you have come far.


You're a long way from Mayfair
for writings that are merely serviceable.


Luckily for me, there is
a thrilling invention called a carriage


that may convey a lady
from one place to another.


It is a marvel, to be sure.


What's your name?


[speaker continues indistinctly]


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> Bridgerton.
- Pleased to meet you, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span>.


I'm Theo Sharpe.


I know.


You know?


As I know, there are
several errors in your arguments


that I must bring to your attention.


Have you a pencil?
Never mind. You may borrow mine.


[speaker] ...to marry you, did she not?
Allow me to continue.


It is most refreshing on the water.


These days, it is hard to find
even a moment of peace.


One of the things
I enjoyed most when I visited <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Many</span> think it a bustling, noisy place,


but I found the country
most tranquil in nature.


There's a river just outside
the home where I grew up.


On hot days,
I would sneak away to soak my feet.


The turtles and I
became quite good friends.


Sounds idyllic.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] It is.


Which is why I'm counting the days
until I may return home.


I had assumed you would remain in England
now that your sister is to be viscountess.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> will remain here.
I shall journey back alone.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">An</span> adventure, indeed.


You have plans for your arrival?


I shall teach.
Become a governess, as you call it here.


It will be most fulfilling.


Enjoying an independent life,
running my own household.


And perhaps playing host to old friends?


I've long thought
to return to <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span> myself


since there is much to be learned
from their medical practice.


[chuckles softly]


If your travels do lead you there,


then I would be most happy
to show you the places I know.


I should be working at the club, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Alice</span>.


Not taking a stroll.


This is work.


We need more gentlemen members,
and here they are.


Mr. Mondrich.


Word of your prowess crossed the Atlantic.


You got the better of McKellan
in just two rounds, is that not so?


That was a long time ago.


I've been known to plant
a few facers in the ring myself.


Ah, but not up to your abilities,
I'm sure. [chuckles]


You must pay a visit
to <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>'s club and talk more.


You'll find it enlivening
and has a warm welcome for all.


That may be the most
tempting invitation I've had in some time.


Uh, Lord Featherington, a word?


[Jack] Excuse me.


Need I remind you that
the answer to our family's predicament


will not be found disporting yourself
in places of public resort?


Nor will it be solved by running up
yet more bills at the modiste.


I just saw the latest accounts.


You are supposed to
be finding a way out of this mess,


not drowning us even deeper in debt.


[quietly] Keep your voice down.


Are you trying to ruin us all?


Not when you are already
making such fine work of it yourself.


[laughter and chatter]


I see you are smiling, Didi.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span> the amusements London has to offer.


There's water, too, in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> sister spares no opportunity
to find reasons for me to stay.


I may well join her in her endeavors.


That knot will never hold.


It is perfectly adequate.


Then I must question
your nautical skills, Dorset.


Allow me.


- [sighs]
- [clattering]


[Anthony] Pardon me.


[dog barking]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


Lord Bridgerton.


- [dog barks, yelps]
- [both shouting]


[people gasping]


- [shouts]
- [laughing]


Oh my! Are you hurt?


[laughs] Not at all!


The water is a rather
welcoming refreshment,


is it not, Bridgerton?


Whoo! [laughs]


[sighs] Refreshing indeed.


Come now. It is not proper to stare.


[grunts softly]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span>, what are you doing here?


I thought we were to walk,
as we usually do.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> apologies. I had quite forgotten.


Uh, well... you missed quite
the scene at the lake yesterday.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> brother's impromptu swim?
I heard about it.


[laughs] Where were you?


Alas, I was forced to occupy my day
with tedious wedding errands,


which Mama has listed me for yet again.


I'm sorry,
but I cannot stroll with you today.


- I shall see you tomorrow, then.
- Of course.


Pardon me. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span>?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> seems to have misplaced
her reticule when she was out yesterday.


I'll be happy to retrieve it.
Where exactly did she visit?


You'll not find it again, miss.


I warned her, the streets
of Bloomsbury aren't fit for a lady.


- What are you doing?
- Ah, Lord Featherington.


Mr. Brookes here is just
taking a look at some jewelry for me.


It is a fine piece, is it not?


Indeed.


Uh, this is not a good time.


- He should return at another date.
- Nonsense. He's here now.


And it is no trouble, is it?


No.


I was only planning
to have the jewels cleaned,


but tell me, what might
a necklace such as that fetch?


If it is of great value,
I shall have to take more care.


Well, I would require my proper tools
for a definitive valuation,


but I'd say you should
take very great care, indeed.


It is rare to see stones this fine.


Now, is that not something?


Thank you for your expert services,
Mr. Brookes.


I shall be in communication with you
should I require anything further.


No cake, then?


- Another time.
- Mm-hmm.


Need I remind you, those are
as counterfeit as a two-pound note.


Quality counterfeits.


If they're good enough to fool
that nibbling owl of a man,


then we may well make it
through the season yet.


I do hope you know
what you're playing at. [scoffs]


Well, there is no need to dismiss
any staff, after all, Mrs. Varley.


Mm. Let us pray he's got
a whole trunk of them, ma'am.


One bauble does not a fortune make.


I declare, that's rather good.


I am skilled at more
than simply standing naked,


Mister...


Bridgerton. I do not doubt it.


Then perhaps inform the academy.


Although two
of the founding members are women,


we are still not yet allowed
to enter the classroom.


At least, not while we are clothed.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you work as a model


as a way of learning from the lectures?


- Ingenious.
- Care to take a turn?


It is harder than it looks.


[<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Benedict</span> inhales] Mm.


[inhales sharply] Like so?


[chuckles]


[<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Benedict</span> sighs deeply]


How long must I stay like this?


That depends.


What I really need
is a study of the male form.


The naked form.


What say you?


[water babbling]


It is a lovely spot, is it not?


It reminds me of the courtyard


at the palace where we used to live.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> calming.


[exhales deeply]


- Calming, yes.
- [chuckles softly]


Nobody would blame you
if you were to take sick, Mama,


and send apologies
for missing the dinner tonight.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury has made it quite clear


that it is necessary
for all of us to attend.


When was the last time you saw them?


The night your dear father asked
for my hand in marriage, I believe.


Lord Sheffield made it clear,


in no uncertain terms,
that he did not support the match.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I had a choice to make


between my family


and my heart.


And did you ever regret that choice?


[exhales]


From the very first moment,


your father and I were drawn together.


It is a very powerful thing


to meet someone
and feel that you know them.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> a way unlike any other.


[chuckles softly]


Still a rather high price
to pay for love, I would think.


Do not fret.


Even my parents' presence cannot mar
the happiness that is the occasion.


I had always hoped that you and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>


would be spared the choice
between affluence and love,


and now you shall.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is to wed her heart's desire.


And you have always wanted
nothing more than your freedom.


[chuckles softly]


Of course, Mama.


We shall all be perfectly happy.


- [knocking]
- [door opens]


Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield's return
is certainly a surprise. [chuckles]


But it shall be pleasant to see
the family reconciled, will it not?


I will be finished in a moment, Mother.
We shall not be late.


It is not that.


[sighs] I have been watching you all week.


I... I told myself
I would support your choice,


but I must admit,
I am finding it quite difficult


to continue to stay silent.


You have been anything but silent.


This is your betrothal, Anthony.


Your marriage.


To the woman that shall replace me
as head of this household, might I add.


You question <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s
suitability for the role?


I question the example
you are setting your siblings,


marrying a woman for whom you clearly
hold no great tenderness or love.


Why will you not accept that
the love match between you and father


was the exception, not the rule?


Because I wish for you two to know
the joy of an exceptional marriage.


You should be excited to wed <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>,


but for all I have seen, you act as if
you are approaching the gallows instead.


If this is not what you want,


you must say something now,
Anthony, before...


What I want is beside the point.


I could never dishonor
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> by begging off now.


You are right.


A gentleman cannot take back his word.


But a woman may.


It happens all the time with young ladies,


swept up in the dizziness
of receiving a proposal


before the reality
of marriage becomes clear.


If <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> were
to call off the engagement,


no one would find fault with her.


And you would not be dishonoring her
in the slightest,


releasing her from the obligation
before any vows were exchanged.


She does not wish to end the engagement.


But does she know
your true feelings on the matter?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> feelings are of no concern.


What matters is my responsibility,
which has always been to wed.


[softly] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> darling...


If you have doubts,
do not simply set them aside.


This is the most important choice
you will ever make.


And it would break my heart


to see you spend
the rest of your life in regret.


I dare say it would break
your father's heart too.


You seem distracted, Didi.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> sighs] Oh.


It's, uh, just a headache.


From, uh...
From all the excitement these days.


Is that all that ails you? I have seen
how ill at ease you are with the viscount.


I was hoping we had put all that behind us
now that Anthony is to be my husband.


He's asked you
to call him by his given name?


No, not yet.


But it sounds fine, does it not?


[sighs] Do you think
the Sheffields will like this dress?


[giggles] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> stomach is in a knot,
I am so excited to meet them.


Before you do,


there is something I must tell you


about your grandparents,
and how they have, in fact,


influenced our trip...


Our guests have arrived.


[giggles nervously]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury chuckles]


You may spare me
the instruction, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.


I know I am to be on my best behavior.


You think me an unfeeling harridan,


but perhaps it would surprise you to learn


that I am hosting this dinner


for your sake.


Your sister's betrothal may be the end


of certain hopes
you harbored regarding the viscount,


but access to the Sheffield fortune


would certainly be
a fine reward, would it not?


A life of independence


is no mere consolation.


Indeed, many would think it
the better prize.


After passion cools and fate intervenes,


who else is a woman left with


but herself?


Hmm.


Come along.


Our guests are waiting.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] Hmm.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury] Hmm.


Ah, Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield,
it has been too long.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">May</span> I present <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma
and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> Sharma.


Oh, my dear, look at you.


Isn't she quite
as lovely as the report said?


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] You are too kind.


I'm most happy to make your acquaintance.


We have been waiting
so many years to meet you.


I wish to know everything about you.


Do you enjoy dancing? Music?


You must accompany us to the opera.


We have a fine box
which has been gathering dust.


Indeed, it has been too long
since we've seen you both in town,


Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield.


- Yes.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield] Yes, indeed, it has.


Mother.


- Father.
- Mm.


I do enjoy the opera.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> sister <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> is the one
who introduced me to it.


Ah. Shall we go through to dinner?


Oh, yes. Come with me, child.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> giggles]


- [laughter]
- [silverware clinking]


And, of course, you must be
our guests at the Sheffield manor.


It is nothing compared
to the estates at Aubrey Hall,


to be sure, but I think it
a most pretty part of Hertfordshire.


Do you sh**t? We have a fine stock
of birds, and you are always welcome.


[Anthony] Thank you for the invitation.
I do enjoy sh**ting.


[Lord Sheffield] Well...


As does <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>.


The two of them almost bagged a stag
on our trip to the country.


[chuckling] How... unusual.


Do they teach
young ladies to sh**t in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>?


Only the fortunate ones.


[exhales]


Uh, Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield,


how long do you plan to remain in town?


Oh, we shall stay for the wedding.


Imagine. The queen herself


overseeing my granddaughter's nuptials.


Her Majesty is kind to be so forgiving
after everything that has happened.


[Lord Sheffield] Now, now.
We are all family here.


Oh, yes, of course we are.


Even after our daughter
so callously rejected


the match we had found for her.


- [Lord Sheffield] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> dear, we agreed...
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">An</span> earl, no less, with , acres.


Any other young lady


would've fallen to her knees in gratitude
that her parents were showing such care.


This sauce is delicious, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.
Have your cook give mine the recipe.


It is the gooseberry, I believe.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield, you've got
quite the sweet tooth, I do recall?


And all for what? A mere clerk, was he?


And with a child
from a previous marriage to God-knows-who.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother has a name.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield, I must ask...


We could not show
our faces in society for years.


Not that she should care.


She simply sailed away
from all of us with that man,


robbing us of our grandchild.


Grandchildren.


I have two daughters


with whom you have had
every opportunity to form a connection.


But the choice to shun us was yours alone.


I beg your pardon...


And do not think I took it lightly,


being cast out
by the only family I had ever known.


I was heartbroken, indeed.
But in time, I came to see


that, in your cruelty,
you did us all a great service.


I hardly think this
a proper dinner conversation.


I quite agree. Please, collect...


When you cast me out,
what you did was set me free.


Free to raise my daughters
far from your constant judgment


and craven demands
that they should chase wealth


and titles above all else!


[scoffs] You are a fine one to talk.


You speak of scorning riches,
and yet you have come crawling back


to snatch at our fortune.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury is right...
- Believe me, I want nothing from you.


Oh, you may not,
but your daughter certainly does.


Mama?


The trust fund we have set up for her.
The condition of which clearly states


that she must marry a man
of good English breeding to inherit.


You did not think we would allow
another generation to pollute


the Sheffield name, did you?


Didi, what are they talking about?


- What have you done?
- Anthony, did you know about this?


I shall explain everything.


I see this one has inherited
your penchant for avoiding the truth.


Or that's something
she inherited from her father.


[Anthony] That is enough.


I can only think
you've been exiled from good society


because of your deficient manners
rather than any other sin.


Since the moment you arrived,
you have failed to show the proper respect


for the Sharma family,
and I will not stand for it.


- I declare...
- I will not... stand for it.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Mary has done admirably
in raising her daughters.


They are intelligent, kind, loyal women.


And a credit to both their parents.


And since you clearly do not wish
to jeopardize your social standing


by associating with such company,
I suggest you do not.


You may leave at once!


You cannot be serious!


Please send for Lord
and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield's carriage.


They can wait outside.


And do not trouble yourselves
for an invitation for the wedding,


for you shall not receive one.


This is beyond the pale.


And if you think
you shall inherit a single sovereign now,


you are sorely mistaken.


Lord Bridgerton, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Bridgerton.


- I must apologize...
- We should take our leave.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span>] Yes.


Thank you for the evening, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.


It was quite enlightening.


[grunts] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lord...


Good evening.


- You lied to me.
- Please, Bon.


Lord Bridgerton!


Lord Bridgerton, I beg a word!


- We must be going.
- Please.


[breathing heavily]


Mother, I shall meet you at the house.


You must know. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is innocent
in all of this. She had no idea.


Coming to England, finding her a match.
I only wished the best for her.


- You cannot be angry at her.
- I am not.


It is clear she was as much in the dark
as I was about your schemes.


- They were not schemes.
- I take it there'll be no dowry.


Now that the Sheffields
have withdrawn their support.


You care about a dowry?


It is because of what you just did
that the Sheffields withdrew it.


It is regrettable, to be sure.


But clearly, both <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>
and I have been misled,


and it is best to call off
this doomed engagement


before it is the cause of any more strife.


Of course, I'd never
besmirch her reputation.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury
will make a plan...


There shall be no plan.
I do not understand.


Why are you suggesting this?


All along, you have been set
on marrying my sister,


despite my every objection, might I add,


and now you intend to cast her aside.


Why?


And do not talk to me of dowries, sir,


for we both know you have no need of it.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, tell me, what has she done?


She has done nothing. It is you.
You have made this match impossible.


- But I am leaving for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>.
- And it is not far enough!


Do you think that there is
a corner of this Earth


that you could travel to far away enough


to free me from this torment?


I am a gentleman.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> father raised me to act with honor,
but that honor is hanging by a thread


that grows more precarious
with every moment


I spend in your presence.


You are the bane of my existence.


And the object of all my desires.


[quietly] Night and day, I dream of you.


And what I... [exhales]


Do you even know all the ways
a lady can be seduced?


The things I could teach you.


[both breathing heavily]


[quietly] I did not ask for this.


[sighs] To be plagued by these feelings.


Hiding from my sister.


Being driven to distraction
every time you enter the room.


Then you agree.


It is insupportable.


Impossible.


[heartbeats thumping]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> exhales]


If I wed your sister, it will bind me
and you together for eternity,


and I will spend every day of my marriage


wanting you,


dreaming of you,


dreading the day when my last thread
of honor finally snaps.


Is that the future that you want for us?


For your sister?


[exhales]


[distant chatter]


I must go.


[exhales sharply]


[sighs] Must we sit around like statues?


I wish to be at a ball,
showing off my new fiancé.


Varley?


Are you certain we've not received


any invitations you may have
overlooked for the evening?


No, ma'am. There's been nothing.


Perhaps the circumstances of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span>'s
engagement has us on the outs yet again.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> this is my fault?


I did not say that.


It's not as if you arranged to meet
Cousin Jack in that orangery, did you?


We should merely be happy we still have
a cook and a lady's maid each, yes, Mama?


Not a single invitation
since arriving back from the country.


I shall alert the postal clerk.


This is no joke.


We are meant to be a distinguished family.


But for years, I have suffered
the indignities of the ton's disdain,


for one reason or another.


They liked us well enough
when they thought you a plum catch,


but now that you are spoken for,
ah, we are outcasts again.


All the more reason to end
this sham of an engagement.


It is not an option.


Lord Cowper.


What business did he have with you?


He wishes to invest in the mines.
Several of them do.


Bored gentlemen with too much time
and money on their hands.


- Take it.
- The mines are worthless.


There are no rubies to be found.


How are they to know the difference?
Board a ship to the Americas?


[chuckles, inhales]


You are serious.


The future of this family
hangs in the balance, my lord.


I've never been more serious in my life.


Get them to invest.
Take every pound that they offer.


Our fortunes will be restored.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> shall have a fine wedding,


and I shall never have to suffer
the disdain of the ton again.


- [knocking]
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>?


Ever since the viscount
has been courting me,


I have sensed
you were not being entirely truthful.


And now I know I was right.


This business with the Sheffields
and their fortune,


you did not trust me enough
to tell me what was really going on.


I am truly sorry, Bon, for keeping
both you and Mama in the dark.


After Appa d*ed,


I took it upon myself
to manage our affairs.


I wrote to the Sheffields,
and after learning of their stipulations,


I saw an answer to all our troubles.


I thought I was doing the right thing


by keeping you free from this burden.


But you must know,


it has weighed on me every day.


I am not a little girl anymore, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>.


I am a grown woman now,
ready to be a wife.


Yes.


Yes, I know.


[sighs softly]


If Lord Bridgerton does not wish
to end our engagement...


then the Sheffield fortune
would not matter, would it?


Once I am married to the viscount,


there will be ample funds
to provide for all of us.


He is as generous as he is wealthy.


I am sure the viscount
will provide for you and Mama too.


He...


He might.


But... But, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>,
this should not be your burden.


What burden would it be
to marry the person I love?


You love him?


Watching how nobly he defended us
at dinner tonight, how could I not?


I want nothing more than to be his wife.


His viscountess.


But he will have to forgive us.


Do you think he will?


That I do not know.


I shall not be long.


Do not tell me
you've traveled at this ungodly hour


to offer more corrections of my writing?


It was the only time
I could leave without being seen.


And, on the contrary,


I've come to ask for your discernment.


Is that so?


Do not look so pleased.


It is a rare occurrence
that I doubt shall be repeated.


[sighs] I have questions
about the writings in this pamphlet.


Well, the ideas can tax a fragile mind.


Or perhaps your means of communicating
them leaves much to be desired.


Or perhaps you have not seen enough
of the world to make sense of them yet.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> chuckling] Ah.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Whistledown] Duty.


More than laws or faith,
I have often thought it the bond


that holds our fragile society together.


Duty to rank and title.


Fidelity to one's family name.


It demands both utter obedience


and total sacrifice.


But what happens


when such duty


is in conflict
with the heart's true desire?


Why, then, there is the potential


for a considerable scandal, indeed.


The only question is,


will the parties in question
heed my warning?


Or is it already too late


to turn back to duty


and away from desire?


[classical rendition of
"You Oughta Know" plays]


[breathing deeply]


[horse snorts]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


I see you continue here
with your morning rides.


As do you, it seems.


I couldn't sleep.


[quietly] Nor could I.


Have you decided what you will do?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Long</span> have I wrestled with it,
but I see no other option.


I will talk with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> today...


and see my way to ending things.


It is the only way to ensure


that the two of us can be rid
of this impossible situation.


Once the engagement is over,
our paths need never cross again.


It will be as if we had never met.


You cannot. You cannot do that.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma...
- You cannot break my sister's heart.


She is all things good and true.
A kinder soul you will never find.


She has loved me
as well as any sister could,


and I could not live with myself


if I robbed her of her happiness
and the future she deserves.


I... I do not understand.


You have been
against this union from the start.


I was wrong! I will not be
the cause of you losing your honor


any more than I can stand
to see <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> in pain.


You once saw her as your perfect match.


You will find your way
to believing it again.


Please.


Please, Lord Bridgerton.


Anthony.


You must keep your word.
You must marry my sister.


You must marry her as soon as you can,


because this feeling
that plagues us so, it will pass.


It will become tenable,
it will become bearable,


and soon enough,
it will be as if we never felt it at all.


Mere passion. It must because it has to.


[classical rendition of
"You Oughta Know" continues]


[sighs]


Very well.


I shall see that the wedding
shall take place as soon as possible.


[sighs deeply]


[sniffles]


[exhales sharply]

<@#<b>(Japan)The King's Affection--Episode 7.txt</b>#@><br />
﻿PREVIOUSLY…


Are you all right, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un of the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>


is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?


-No.
-Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness!


Why do you have this book?


That girl must have been someone
quite special to you.


-She was my first love.
-You have a big problem!


The Minister of Personnel
lodged an appeal for your resignation.


For my resignation?
I'm in need of your help.


You are the only person
who can help me now.


There is nothing I can do for you.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I advise you to stop asking.


You could have punished just me
from the beginning.


Why are you torturing my innocent friends
and putting everyone in danger?


Moreover, he deceived
me and the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.


The degree of his crime is quite severe.


Who is going to get killed?


I order you as the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.
Hand over the prisoners.


If you do, no one will shed
a drop of blood here tonight.






Allow me…


to answer that question.


I was the one…


who moved the prisoners.


I was taught that prisons are where
prisoners receive punishment,


not where they are meant to die.


Despite that objective of His Majesty's,


their living conditions
have become horrendous


and have led to prisoners starving
or freezing to death.


It is why I seek forgiveness
regarding the unsanctioned transfer


of said prisoners.


You dare interrupt today's ruling


to notify me of this frivolous matter?


Your Majesty, I have urgent information


regarding the incidents at Samgaebang.


This is not a matter His <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness
should involve himself in.


I'll allow it.


Speak.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> never disobeyed
the custom of our class system.


Those who actually did…


are them.


Enter.


One is a herb gatherer


who supplied pharmacies within the capital


and one is the custodian
of Literary Licentiate Choi's storage.


Repeat to His Majesty what you told me.


The accusation that
the physician of Samgaebang


only prescribed pricey medicine
is a false one.


Literary Licentiate Choi over here
bought all the medicinal herbs


available from villages


and stocked them in the storage he owns.


Regardless of age,
people started dying left and right


due to a lack of medicine.


After learning the truth, Physician <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>
found herbs that provide similar remedies


and made them affordable.


It resulted in the price drop
of the herbs in storage


which prompted this accusation.


Is this all true?


Of course not, Chief State Councilor!
I'm being falsely accused.


No, we speak the truth!


I have a ledger that lists
all transactions of the herbs.


MEDICINAL HERB INVENTORY LEDGER


Unlike the rumors surrounding Samgaebang,


you are saying it was a place
that helped the unfortunate.


It never indulged in foul play either.


Yes, but I guess


that depends on what you view
as following the rules and being dutiful.


All I want to say is that it's a place
that didn't go against the justice


I wish to promote in this nation.


And <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> shares
the very same values.


I also believe His <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness' claims
to be true, Your Majesty.


But you were the one


who first raised questions
regarding this matter!


Please forgive me for acting rashly


without taking a deeper look
into the underlying truth, Your Majesty.


I hear you.
However, that was not the only issue.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un became a royal tutor


without disclosing his prior operations.


If I dare say so, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>
never lied about his past endeavors.


I accepted his teaching
while aware of his past,


and I'm sure you remember
that I informed you of this matter.


But you chose not to listen to me.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> the end,


you were the one who moved forward
with appointing him as my tutor.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> if anyone's to blame,


it would be Your Majesty
and the high officials of the court


who did not properly conduct
a background check.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> us being negligent is to blame?


Do not forget.


The path I choose


will be your path.


And if you deviate from that path,


I will not forgive you,


no matter how much I adore you.


I wish to take


that path with you.


Aren't you curious


as to in what way…


I wish to follow your lead?


Is the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> ready
to fight his battle?


EPISODE 7


Thank you so much.


Your gratitude should be extended
to His <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness, not me.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness,


no words can possibly convey my gratitude.


There is no need to thank me.


I just could not sit idly by


when I knew the truth.


If you head to Seorin-bang,


you'll be able to reunite
with your assistants.


I had no idea you'd take action
in solving this issue.


Well…


He's your friend, isn't he?


And he's also…


my tutor.


JEONOKSEO


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un.
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un.


You obtained the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>'s trust
in a short amount of time.


I'd expect no less
from someone as prodigious as you.


If you ever harm them again--


I won't force you…


to find a place within the royal court.


But don't you dare think about
being a hack of a physician again.


For your sake
and your mother's especially.


Just remember that it isn't easy
to cope with your one and only son


being chewed out.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady, the night is deep.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady, where are you headed?
-Stop this. I can't take it anymore.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady, it's dangerous.
-Let go!


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady.
-I won't let this slide.


-But it's dangerous.
-What could be so dangerous?


-Let go of me!
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady!


Let go.


-Those blabbermouths--
-I knew it.


I was wondering whose voice was so loud.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un!


Gosh. Are you all right? Are you?


Of course I am.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lady, your shoes don't match.


You can give me those
and go about your business.


Did the ladies in Bukchon
speak ill of me again?


No, that's not it.


They once loved to pass around
the medicine you prescribed,


but now they're saying ridiculous things.


They're obviously jealous
that you became a royal tutor,


so how can I let them carry on?


That's feisty coming from
the inspector's better half.


From what I hear, you used to be
the most timid maiden in the village.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> one and only son made me
a salty woman, that's why.


Until when will you find shelter
elsewhere from home?


It's time you moved back in.


Your father is gravely worried about you.


I'm sorry.


Goodness, I repeated the same thing again.


Just come by whenever you want to.
Like today.


Your room is still as it was.


Success doesn't mean
finding work at the palace.


Doing what you love and being happy
is the definition of a successful life.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> don't let others intimidate you


and live your life as you wish.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t let others dictate your life.
Do you hear me?


What…


Weren't you going to leave the palace


once you saved your assistants?


How could I possibly leave
when you went through so much


to clear my name?


I decided to stay where my heart lies
for a while longer.


Your heart?


I seem to have had
the wrong idea about you.


I let your nicknames
Five Step <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> and Ice <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>


cloud my judgment


and assumed that
you were audacious and cold-hearted.


However, that wasn't the case.


Your generosity knows no limit,
Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


You could have easily been written about
in this Confucian classic.


A cold-hearted soul


who doesn't bat an eye
even at the sight of death?


No, that was only a preposterous rumor.


I'm living proof of it, don't you agree?


That being said,


why was His <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness
given the nickname Ice <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>?


Because his heart
is icy cold all year round--


Ice is clear and sparkles under the sun.


It is more elegant than any other jewel.


And that is the origin


behind his nickname the Ice <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>!


Why does it feel like there's a chance
of him getting a promotion before me?


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


We have fine weather today.


Isn't it nice to enjoy
a lecture outside for a change?


You should watch where you're going.


Walking backward will surely
make you trip and fall into a pond.


I'm more sturdy and nimble
than people think


which is why I have never tripped before--


Goodness!


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


How cool.


Wait for me, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness!


THE WATER IS COLD AND THE NIGHT IS CHILLY


WITH WIND…


What have you been
taking your time writing?


WELCOME RAIN ON A SPRING NIGHT


A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT


"A good rain knows its seasons right."


I don't think
I properly expressed my gratitude


for the help I received.


Like the good rain
that falls when most needed,


I will be someone who you can count on.


Just like you were to me
when I needed you the most.


Goodness.


It's raining, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Perfect timing, don't you think?


A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness, it's <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Bok</span>-dong.


What is this about?


Oh, Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim ordered me
to check if you're set for the night.


I see.


-By the way, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Bok</span>-dong.
-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


It's about <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>.


Has he been getting along
with those at the royal institute?


You have no idea. Life at the palace
must be like second nature to him now


considering how he brings them alcohol
and gladly trades shifts.


He is as amiable as they get
and is highly praised by the rest.


You can tell


that he's nothing like his father
from the way he acts toward you.


Why do you ask about him though?


What? No reason.


If you're done, dismiss yourself already.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.
I wish you a good night.


A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT


Since His Majesty is in poor health,


it might not be a bad idea
for the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>


to greet the envoys.


I'm well aware of your desire
to give more authority


to His <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Then I'll trust that


you will make a formal request
to His Majesty.


But I hope you don't think
that I will blindly act


according to your desires.


It's what I noticed with the incident
involving the royal tutor,


but lately,


I haven't been pleased about you


overstepping your authority.


Overstepping my authority?


I…


vowed my allegiance to the former king


with blood on my lips.


How could you possibly say such a thing


when I put my life on the line
to help him take the throne?


I understand your fondness
for the Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>,


but His Majesty is also
someone you must serve.


If you offend him in any way,
you will answer to me.


Your Highness, then wouldn't it
only be fair that you lead by example?


What?


More and more key officials
are being appointed in your favor.


You should never forget


that it is I who have been
considerate of your desire


to give your family power.


You dare threaten me?


Of course not, Your Highness.


All I want


is for those after
His <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness' crown


to no longer be a threat.


That is all.


Therefore…


I suggest we refrain from
pointless squabbles, Your Highness.


A foot disorder?


-Has Father's foot disease returned?
-Yes.


His Majesty has been overwhelmed
with state affairs


and his prognosis isn't good.


Aside from Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim and Eunuch Hong,


he's the first to protect you
from close proximity.


Hasn't it been uncomfortable?


I should learn to get used to it.


I cannot forever be served
by only Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim and Eunuch Hong.


Right.


Your Majesty.


Leave the herbal tonic.


Father.


It is I.


I see. What brings you by?


I would like to make a request.


Please let me be
in charge of receiving the envoys.


Aren't you aware of
that being <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span> Jaeun's responsibility?


Actually, I was hoping


to greet them in your place
when they arrive at the palace.


I'm aware that the same request
came from the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> Dowager as well.


And who says that is what I want?


I will greet the envoys
according to custom.


You are dismissed.


Father,


do you still not have faith in me?


I am well aware that you were against
my installation as Crown <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Prince</span>.


Was it…


because of my maternal grandfather?


Or…


was it…


because of Gyeom?


What is your reason…


for bringing that up after all this time?


I understand that
you find my grandfather to be difficult.


But this is what I want for myself.


I ask you


to put your faith in me this time.


I…


won't let you down.


He sure is adorable.


There is something
quite adorable about him.


How are preparations coming along
at the guesthouses for the envoys?


Have you heard from the governor who went
to Uiju to accompany the envoys?


You should pace yourself and take it easy.


I am taking His Majesty's place.


There can be no room for error.


Let your mind rest for now.
We have to be at the market soon.


I will first retrieve
the report sent by the governor.


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


I hear lectures have been canceled
to focus on greeting the envoys.


Yes, I'm afraid I won't be able
to attend for the time being.


I see.


Since you're busy, I'll keep it short.


Not even the legendary physician Hua Tuo
has seen these pills


which were made
with a drop of dragon tears--


Do you have nothing to do?
Why don't I ask <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Scholar <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Yang</span> to--


Hardly. I actually have
urgent business to address.


Take some when you are having
a difficult time.


It will give you courage
and relieve you of anxiety.


Then…


Oh, right.


Was it <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> who just came by?


No one can match his anti-climactic ways.


They are all of good quality.


As if.


Let me take a look
since I know a thing or two.


I'll take this one.


Have them delivered to Samgaebang.


This one right here.


And this as well as this.


-You know what? Just send them all.
-Yes, my lady.


They are all to be sent to Samgaebang?


Like I said, I owe them that much.


What on earth?


You must be the type
to apologize with gifts rather than words.


Oh, well…


Wait, is that wrong?


I'm apologizing for my wrongdoing
by buying them what they need the most.


I only do so because I can afford it.


I'm just saying.


Anyway, why are you carrying around
that hand plow?


Oh, this? I'm looking
for some flowers to plant.


I can't afford to buy them
like someone I know,


so I must acquire them myself.


Wait.


Forgive me.


For putting you in a predicament, I mean.


I wanted to apologize in person,


but I couldn't muster up the courage.


Why are you laughing?


Well, because I was only joking.


Besides, you shouldn't apologize.


It's not like you told lies
just to get me into trouble.


Never did I think


you'd be a fun person to tease.


Let's see.


Why do you wish to plant flowers
within the palace grounds though?


Well, they're pretty. That's why.


We should hang up more square lanterns
to light up the streets more.


-<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> do, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.
-Good.


And the decorations?


They should also be prepared accordingly.


What's the matter?


Oh.


It's nothing.


Do you know them?


Yes, he is--


I mean, they are colleagues I work with.


I see. Do you work
at the royal institute then?


Well, I guess.


I see.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">May</span> I ask who we're speaking to?


Oh, forgive my belated introduction.


I am <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Shin</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>-eun.


There are no other empty seats,


-so go ahead--
-Actually, since we ran into each other,


why don't we sit down for a meal?


Four bowls of soup with rice, please.


Didn't you say you were busy?


Never did I imagine you having
an affectionate side, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>.


Affectionate?


How pretty.


The flowers, I mean.


Oh, these.


He spared me a few.


Anyway, how do you two know each other?


Well, that's…


It's a very long story.


Here's the food you ordered.


Goodness. We should eat first.


-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.


All right. Allow me to add a spoonful.


-Allow me.
-It's fine. I'll do it myself.


This is more of my specialty,
so let me do it.


I said it's fine!


Goodness. Are you all right?


I'll do it myself.


Lord <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>, your sleeves are also stained.


I'm… I'm fine, but…


GWANGHWAMUN


I guess it's been a while
since you set foot


in your homeland.


Homeland? What a joke.


NOKUNGAK


We did our best
to make your stay here with us


as comfortable as possible.


I do hope everything is up to par.


We appreciate all you have done for us.


You can speak more at ease now
for we have prepared much as well.


This ornamental knife
has accompanied us from <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ming</span>.


It's a lucky one, don't you think?


I'd rather rest, so please leave us.


I'm sure you're aware that a new emperor
ascended to the throne a year ago.


From what I hear,
those two played a major role.


This way, please.


They await you.


I'm glad you're here.


Why is Lord Sangheon meeting
with <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Tutor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> has
a history with the Vice Minister of Rites,


so he must be here to greet him.


Would you like to join them?


And say what at an uninvited event?


I'd only be interrupting them.


I heard I was urgently summoned.


Was it by you?


I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.


I'm the one who had you summoned.


Physician <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>!


It's been too long.


What brings you here?


I couldn't locate you in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ming</span>,
so I thought the Left State Councilor


was pulling my leg
when he said he'd let me meet you.


Who knew we'd meet again like this?


Left State Councilor, I'm truly grateful.


To find out that one of my people
saved your life


was a great shock on my part.


I guess this is what destiny looks like.


As if that even qualifies
as saving one's life.


That's a little dramatic.


I'm afraid I must apologize.


Duty calls at
the Office of the Inspector General.


Physician <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span>,
allow me to pour you a drink.


It truly has been too long.


I agree.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> the rumors about
the Left State Councilor


being the richest in Joseon were true.


Then tell me. What is it that he wants?


He was hoping to be given permission
to develop the land in Yeoyeon.


Yeoyeon?


Barbarians constantly invade that land.
Why would he want to develop…


I see.


He wishes to build an army under
the pretense of protecting the border.


How greedy of him.


Let him know
that he does not need to worry.


Thank you for the warm welcome.


However, if you had focused
more of your energy


on the roads leading to Joseon,


I wouldn't be so fatigued from the trip.


That means we'd be clearing a path
for the barbarians up north,


which is why we've been hesitant.


You still should have
cleared a road to <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ming</span> though.


Developing the land in Yeoyeon will make
trading with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ming</span> less demanding.


That place is
a strategic point for our defense.


Hasty decisions cannot be made.


That's why I'm offering my assistance.


I will mention the issues
regarding Yeoyeon to the Emperor,


so all I suggest is that
you send a quick response.


Goodness.


Isn't she beautiful?


Especially the one in the second row.


Is there a girl who has caught your eye?


Please do not hesitate to tell me.


It can be ten or a hundred.
I'll make sure you receive them tonight.


I hear that girls sent as offerings
are quite adored.


One of them was blessed
into becoming an imperial concubine.


The girl to serve you tonight


will also be a lucky one.


I see.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I can have my pick of girls?


Your request is my command.


From what I hear,
your wife's beauty is blinding.


Could I take her back with me?


Pardon?


Goodness. That was quite the jest.


A jest?


Then were you taunting me just now?


Being sent to <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ming</span> as an offering
is an honor


but not when it comes to your own family?


No, that is not what I meant.


What is the meaning of this?


There's nothing to be alarmed about.


It's just that this man
made promises to me that he can't keep.


I will punish him accordingly
once I gather all the facts,


so please let your anger subside.


Goodness. What is there
to investigate and find out?


If needed,


he can be executed on the spot.


Wait. But…


Please spare my life!


That is enough.


You are in the palace of Joseon.


His Majesty stated
that he'd get to the truth,


so let our system take over.


Leave and await your ruling.


Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness!


This isn't your place.


Allow me to greet you.


I am <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Jung</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-un,
a royal tutor at the royal institute.


You seem to be upset
at this festive banquet,


so I'd like to serve you a drink.


Would you accept it?


Please don't be like that
and accept this drink.


I'd consider it a great honor.


You speak out of place
knowing that you are favored


by the Vice Minister of Rites.


Get lost.


Because the drink was from you,


it was divine.


Is that so?


Then have some more.


That's about enough.


Do you not realize
that you're dishonoring the Emperor


by not showing courtesy?


Yes, that is enough.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> this is where you were,
Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Did you have to make me feel uneasy
by doing what I didn't order you to do?


It was an important banquet.


I was only worried
that things would escalate.


It is not your job to worry about me.


Pretend you didn't see anything


or hear anything from now on.


That is how you will be.


Wait. There's another child.
Go and get him.


-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.


Sit down.


I said sit down.


It is not your job to worry about me.


Is this what you serve as food?


Is there a problem?


That'd be my question to you.


What you served is nothing but waste.


What is one supposed to eat?


Forgive me.


I had the kitchen prepare what you enjoy,


but they must not suit your palate.


Prepare the food again.


-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.
-Yes, Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness.


Has a decision been made regarding
the man who taunted me last night?


His mouth should have been
ripped at the corners


to stop him from spewing nonsense.


The Office of the Inspector General
is reviewing the case.


He will be severely punished
once they come to a ruling,


so please let your anger subside.


How about you just
let me deal with him instead?


Executing the punishment myself
means less work for you.


Even a man guilty of treason
is punished by law and custom.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I suggest…


you drop this.


Acting tough, are we?


What…


did you just say?


What do you mean?


What was that?


You dare treat me with disdain?


How dare you communicate
in code in my presence!


That… That is not true, my lord.


Communicating in code?
That is hardly true.


I will have the food served again.


Follow me.


How dare you follow him out.


Damned wench, you just
don't know your place, do you?


Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim!


What are you doing?


As you can see,
I'm teaching her some manners.


Why? Does this require
proper procedure too?


Do you know what I despise the most?


Words or actions of disrespect
which you just showed.


Today, you will be taught some manners.


Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim!


Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim…


Oh, no.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


Court <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Kim…


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness…


Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness…


- Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness, you must not!
- Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness, you must not!


You must not do this.
Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness, no!


Oh, no. Your <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Royal</span> Highness…<br />

﻿[deep breathing]


[heartbeat quickening]


[panting]


[door opens]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charlotte</span>] Viscount Bridgerton.


We thought perhaps
you'd not be joining us.


[Anthony] Your Majesty.


Nothing could keep me
from my beautiful bride.


[sighs deeply]


Now,


tell me of your wedding plan.


There is no talk
of a special license, I would hope.


- [laughter]
- Of course not, Your Majesty.


I believe a modest family affair
would be most fitting.


Perhaps back in the country,
at Aubrey Hall.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charlotte</span>] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> the country?


[laughs]


No, that will not do.


You must have it here in town.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> fact, I shall host the nuptials myself.


- [Mary gasps] Oh.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> laughs happily]


- That is most generous, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ma</span>'am.
- Most generous.


- But not at all necessary.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Charlotte</span>] Nonsense.


She is my diamond, after all.


It is only right that I give you both
a wedding worthy of that title.


Besides, one could almost credit me myself


with bringing about
this most illustrious match.


I shall oversee every detail.


[quietly] Let that gossipmonger
try to get the better of me now.


Can you believe it, Didi?
It is like a fairytale come true.


[chuckles] You deserve nothing less, Bon.


Nothing less for a true love match.


[dishes clattering]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> apologies, Your Majesty.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Whistledown]
The frenzy of competition.


The thrilling delight
of hazarding your all.


I am referring not to the lure
of London's luxurious gaming halls


but to a gamble with far higher stakes.


Matrimony.


For once that particular wager is placed,


it cannot easily be undone.


A fact which, I am sure,


is met with both regret


and sheer relief.


...and I shall sing between each one.


For goodness' sake.


Anyone would think our siblings had beaten
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Napoleon</span> himself on the b*ttlefield


instead of finding someone with whom
to dutifully march down an aisle.


Indeed. With all the hubbub
about <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span>'s engagement,


my mama has rather forgotten I exist.


She is quite happy Cousin Jack
has ensured our family's future.


I must admit, so am I.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> laughs]


Mm. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t touch. You can look at it.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span> laughs]


And the baker is still awaiting payment.


As is, apparently, the coalman.


The new Lord Featherington was
supposed to restore our fortunes, and yet


here I am, unable to scratch together
sixpence yet again.


Our financial predicament is entirely
your doing, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Featherington.


If you hadn't forced me
into this ill-starred engagement,


we'd soon be living comfortably
on <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Cowper's ample dowry.


Oh, go on.
Blame me for taking you at your word


when you spoke
of your great fortune in rubies.


Had you thought to confide your plans,


then I would not be considering dismissing
the servants that I have just rehired.


All of that would be solved
if you would simply call off the wedding


and allow me to set my cap
at <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Cowper again.


And leave my poor <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> jilted?


When her reputation's already
been called into question?


No, it is far too late for that, my lord.


No, you must continue in this engagement.


I will think of something.


Well, you'd better think fast.


You must be one of our new fellows.


Is it really so evident?


Conserve that youthful vigor.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Soon</span> you shall be
just as jaded as the rest of us.


After all, one form is much like another,


do you not think?


[lilting classical music plays]


It is not yet right.
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span> how the cuffs are an inch too short?


Very well, sir.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span>] Hmm.


There is plenty of time
to adjust it to your liking.


The wedding is not for another month.


- There is still much to do.
- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> live with us?


Indeed. After the wedding,


she'll be the lady of the house
and responsible for you all.


Lord, help her.


Which reminds me, our carriages
must be polished to a shine,


and the horses' manes braided.
We should bring out the finest silver.


The queen may be hosting
everything at the palace,


but we must be ready to entertain here.


And what of us, Brother? Should we also
be polished and braided for the big day?


[Anthony] We'll all be on display.


Perhaps you might even
scrub your hands for the occasion?


I've been occupied at the academy.


- What about <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s sister?
- What about her?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> she come to live with us, too?


Oh, I do hope so. It'll be a boon to have
another intelligent woman in the house.


Another? Mm. You're overcounting.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span>, I shall need your help today.


There is the dinner
to plan with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury


to welcome the Sharmas into the family.
And then the engagement ball next week...


I am sorry, Mama, but, uh,


I am attending a lecture
this afternoon. Flower arranging.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> chuckles]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span>'s mama is forcing her to go,


and you've wanted me
to find more ladylike pursuits.


[chuckles]


For how long have you cared
about flower arranging?


I am an open-minded woman.
I can care about many things.


I do wonder about the trim.
Is it too much?


Nothing is too much
now that the queen is hosting.


Let me show you the French tulle.


[quietly] Oh yes.


[exhales deeply]


[breathes deeply]


Did I tell you we will be married
by the archbishop himself?


Several times.


[sighs] We must find you a dress too.


- I have plenty of dresses.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] This one must be special.


After all, this wedding
is as much your triumph as mine.


Whatever you said
to the viscount at Aubrey Hall, Didi,


it clearly swayed him to declare himself.


I... [chuckles]


- I cannot claim credit.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] I shall bestow it, all the same.


It will be so exciting living in London.


The viscount said
there might even be snow this winter.


- Won't that be exciting?
- You must enjoy it without me, Bon.


Recall I am to set sail
soon after you wed.


But you will return to visit, of course.


[chuckles] And when the viscount
and I are blessed with children,


you shall be
their favorite aunt. [chuckles]


Think of us all together as a family.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> exhales]


I do not know why
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s betrothal is so special.


She's quite overshadowed my happy news.


A fact we may well be glad of.
Put those silks down.


Cotton will do for your trousseau.


Has my maid yet delivered that dress
that needs altering, Madame Delacroix?


[speaking French]


[chuckles]


[in English] I received your latest.
It's been a busy week, has it not?


Indeed.


The ton are quite ravenous
for news of the upcoming nuptials.


Perhaps <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Whistledown will report


that I have been entrusted
with our diamond's wedding ensemble.


Tell me, are my musings
not offering you sufficient business?


Indeed.


But why should there be limits
to a woman's ambitions?


I would think you,
of all people, would understand.


There is always more to be achieved.


Thank you, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Clara</span>. That will be all.


Lord Bridgerton?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


Lord Bridgerton and his guest are waiting.


I see that. Thank you.


This is the jeweler.


We are here to have <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s
betrothal ring altered to fit.


[chuckles softly] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> apologies,


but my sister and my mother
have not yet returned home.


Of course.
Then we shall trouble you no further.


Is that cake?


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] It is indeed.


- Lemon?
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] Pardon?


I fancy a good lemon. [chuckles]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> sighs deeply]


Might I offer you some refreshment, Mr...


Brookes. Only if you insist.
I mean, it would be churlish to refuse.


Tea, three spoons of sugar, and perhaps
some sandwiches too, thank you.


[dish clattering]


[Anthony breathes deeply]


[exhales]


It is fine weather
we are having, is it not?


You wish to speak to me of the weather?


Is there another topic of conversation
that'd be more appropriate?


[exhales sharply]
There is nothing appropriate


about what you're doing
proceeding with this engagement.


On the contrary, I believe it is
the most proper outcome for all.


Oh. And what of everything
that passed between us at Aubrey Hall?


[Anthony sighs]


Nothing passed between us.


I am a gentleman.


Is that so?


Need I remind you, sir,
if anyone other than your sister


discovered us in the library that night,
then we, too, would be obliged to wed.


Nothing happened.


Would the two of us being obliged to marry
be the outcome you desire?


Of course not.


Then let us both be... glad
we have avoided such an unthinkable fate.


[Mr. Brookes] I say, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma,


do you and your sister
happen to share gloves?


I...


Yes, on occasion.


I knew it.


I can take the measure
of a hand at paces.


We may use your finger to size the ring.


- Oh, I beg your pardo...
- That shan't be necessary.


[chuckling] Nonsense!


Thank you. [chuckles]


[sighs]


[slow classical music plays]


It is a beautiful piece.


It is the ring my father gave
to my mother before they were wed.


[footsteps approaching]


- Lord Bridgerton?
- They came to, uh, alter the ring.


Uh, Mr. Brookes insisted.


[sighs sharply] Just a moment.


It appears to be stuck.


- Well, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is here now.
- Yes.


- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>, are you...
- Yes, almost.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> grunts]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> sighs]


[grunts] Just, uh...


Just another... [grunts]


[chuckles] There.


- All yours.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury] Ah.


Here you all are.


I have news.


Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield sent word


they are in London.


Our grandparents?


Indeed. It seems they read
the engagement announcement


and wish to make your acquaintance.


And, uh, that of
your future husband, of course.


- I should be delighted to meet them.
- They are already in town?


They arrived... last night.


- [Anthony] Is something wrong?
- Not at all.


I shall invite them
to the engagement dinner tomorrow.


I'm sure it will be a most joyous reunion


after all these years.


Yes, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Mary?


Indeed.


- Hmm. I shall look forward to it.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury] Ah.


- Are you ready to promenade?
- I am, my lord.


I suddenly feel a headache coming on.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury, would you be so kind
as to chaperone my daughter?


Of course.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma and I
would be glad of the fresh air.


Oh, I should really stay with Mama.


You will escort me.


[sighs]


[indistinct chatter]


[children laughing]


Whoa!


[dog panting]


I wish you every happiness.


How could you invite
the Sheffields to dinner


when you know full well


the pain my mother has suffered
after their rejection of her?


Indeed. Which is why I shall not
answer their impoliteness with my own.


And besides, is this not
the reconciliation you wished for?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> returned
to the bosom of the Sheffield family


to reclaim the fortune
you so desperately need?


Yes, but not until after the wedding.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is still in the dark
about the conditions of their favor.


And if the Bridgertons
were to learn of it, they might feel...


As if you contrived a match
for your own concealed ends


and might call off the wedding?


I have to wonder if you might not secretly


rejoice were the viscount
to break the engagement.


Why would you ever say such a thing?


They are betrothed.


The viscount made a charming proposal,


your sister gave her giddy acceptance,


and in the eyes of society,
and, might I add,


the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Queen</span> of England herself,
they are as good as wed.


Only a very great scandal


would prevent this marriage
from proceeding now.


The kind of scandal that would
send alarms through the entire ton


and be a stain from which
the penniless Sharma family


would never recover.


Only a fool
would jeopardize the marriage now.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I ask you,


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma,


are you that fool?


No.


I did not think so.


[Thomas] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.


Mr. Dorset.


- What a pleasure to see you here today.
- [chuckles]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma, perhaps you would be so kind


as to accompany me
on a turn around the lake?


I am rather tired.


She would be delighted.


You're still angry with me
over that business at the races.


I wish to apologize


and throw myself at your mercy.


Very well, my lord.
A turn would be most pleasant.


[chuckling and indistinct chatter]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] What a handsome couple they make.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span> chuckles]


Pardon me?


Mr. Dorset and my sister.


I noticed that he was quite smitten
with her the last time they met.


Perhaps he will convince her
to stay in England, after all.


She barely knows the gentleman.


Nor did I you, at first.


But love moves swiftly, does it not?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>,
you must tell me your favorite colors,


so I may plan to incorporate them


in the ornamentation
for your engagement ball.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>, fading] You are too kind,
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Bridgerton.


[slowed] I am certain
your taste is superb.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> laughing]


[laughter echoing]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span>] ...to honor both
Bridgerton and Sharma families,


now that we are to be joined.


[chuckles]


- [fading in] Is that not so, Anthony?
- [normal] Absolutely.


[chuckles]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> calling out]


Look at me!


Your sister seems... happy.


That is one way of putting it.


The new Lord Featherington
seems an interesting fellow.


A man of commerce, is he not?


Yes. He has ruby mines in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">America</span>.
They are flourishing, I hear.


Perhaps I should introduce myself.


After all, everyone else
is finding some purpose to their lives.


Anthony is to be married.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Benedict</span> has his artistic pursuits.


And, well,


here I am... feeding the ducks.


- [quacking]
- I am sure the ducks are most grateful.


You have a good deal of time and
plentiful opportunities to make your mark.


As <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> would no doubt remind me.


Where is your sister?
I have not seen her out today.


She mentioned something
about flower arranging


with you today, in fact.


Indeed. I am meeting her later.


- Mr. Bridgerton.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span>] Mm.


- [horse snorts]
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> grunts]


This is the place.


Doesn't look like
a place for shopping to me.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span>] I am collecting a unique gift


for my brother's wedding.


[woman] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span>? <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span>!


It is our right to be treated
not merely as chattels.


Surely talk of rights
must draw on Locke's Treatise.


You and your treatise!


If you've ever worked
an honest day's labor,


you know how little
such grand talk serves the working man.


Now, if I may be permitted to continue,


I should like to propose to this assembly


the radical idea
that it is not best for women to rely


for their education


on what falls to them by chance
from their husbands and brothers.


[crowd] Hear! Hear!


[crowd murmuring indistinctly]


Is it not thrilling?


You.


Me.


I told you, I don't know anything
about your Whistledown gossip.


It is not her I seek today,


but the exchange of ideas
with like-minded men and women


on subjects beyond
the trivial concerns of polite society.


Ideas that you yourself
invited me to consider.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, you're an admirer of my work?


I would not go so far.
It is serviceable, I suppose.


And yet you have come far.


You're a long way from Mayfair
for writings that are merely serviceable.


Luckily for me, there is
a thrilling invention called a carriage


that may convey a lady
from one place to another.


It is a marvel, to be sure.


What's your name?


[speaker continues indistinctly]


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> Bridgerton.
- Pleased to meet you, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span>.


I'm Theo Sharpe.


I know.


You know?


As I know, there are
several errors in your arguments


that I must bring to your attention.


Have you a pencil?
Never mind. You may borrow mine.


[speaker] ...to marry you, did she not?
Allow me to continue.


It is most refreshing on the water.


These days, it is hard to find
even a moment of peace.


One of the things
I enjoyed most when I visited <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Many</span> think it a bustling, noisy place,


but I found the country
most tranquil in nature.


There's a river just outside
the home where I grew up.


On hot days,
I would sneak away to soak my feet.


The turtles and I
became quite good friends.


Sounds idyllic.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] It is.


Which is why I'm counting the days
until I may return home.


I had assumed you would remain in England
now that your sister is to be viscountess.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> will remain here.
I shall journey back alone.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">An</span> adventure, indeed.


You have plans for your arrival?


I shall teach.
Become a governess, as you call it here.


It will be most fulfilling.


Enjoying an independent life,
running my own household.


And perhaps playing host to old friends?


I've long thought
to return to <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span> myself


since there is much to be learned
from their medical practice.


[chuckles softly]


If your travels do lead you there,


then I would be most happy
to show you the places I know.


I should be working at the club, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Alice</span>.


Not taking a stroll.


This is work.


We need more gentlemen members,
and here they are.


Mr. Mondrich.


Word of your prowess crossed the Atlantic.


You got the better of McKellan
in just two rounds, is that not so?


That was a long time ago.


I've been known to plant
a few facers in the ring myself.


Ah, but not up to your abilities,
I'm sure. [chuckles]


You must pay a visit
to <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>'s club and talk more.


You'll find it enlivening
and has a warm welcome for all.


That may be the most
tempting invitation I've had in some time.


Uh, Lord Featherington, a word?


[Jack] Excuse me.


Need I remind you that
the answer to our family's predicament


will not be found disporting yourself
in places of public resort?


Nor will it be solved by running up
yet more bills at the modiste.


I just saw the latest accounts.


You are supposed to
be finding a way out of this mess,


not drowning us even deeper in debt.


[quietly] Keep your voice down.


Are you trying to ruin us all?


Not when you are already
making such fine work of it yourself.


[laughter and chatter]


I see you are smiling, Didi.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span> the amusements London has to offer.


There's water, too, in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> sister spares no opportunity
to find reasons for me to stay.


I may well join her in her endeavors.


That knot will never hold.


It is perfectly adequate.


Then I must question
your nautical skills, Dorset.


Allow me.


- [sighs]
- [clattering]


[Anthony] Pardon me.


[dog barking]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


Lord Bridgerton.


- [dog barks, yelps]
- [both shouting]


[people gasping]


- [shouts]
- [laughing]


Oh my! Are you hurt?


[laughs] Not at all!


The water is a rather
welcoming refreshment,


is it not, Bridgerton?


Whoo! [laughs]


[sighs] Refreshing indeed.


Come now. It is not proper to stare.


[grunts softly]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Penelope</span>, what are you doing here?


I thought we were to walk,
as we usually do.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> apologies. I had quite forgotten.


Uh, well... you missed quite
the scene at the lake yesterday.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> brother's impromptu swim?
I heard about it.


[laughs] Where were you?


Alas, I was forced to occupy my day
with tedious wedding errands,


which Mama has listed me for yet again.


I'm sorry,
but I cannot stroll with you today.


- I shall see you tomorrow, then.
- Of course.


Pardon me. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span>?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> seems to have misplaced
her reticule when she was out yesterday.


I'll be happy to retrieve it.
Where exactly did she visit?


You'll not find it again, miss.


I warned her, the streets
of Bloomsbury aren't fit for a lady.


- What are you doing?
- Ah, Lord Featherington.


Mr. Brookes here is just
taking a look at some jewelry for me.


It is a fine piece, is it not?


Indeed.


Uh, this is not a good time.


- He should return at another date.
- Nonsense. He's here now.


And it is no trouble, is it?


No.


I was only planning
to have the jewels cleaned,


but tell me, what might
a necklace such as that fetch?


If it is of great value,
I shall have to take more care.


Well, I would require my proper tools
for a definitive valuation,


but I'd say you should
take very great care, indeed.


It is rare to see stones this fine.


Now, is that not something?


Thank you for your expert services,
Mr. Brookes.


I shall be in communication with you
should I require anything further.


No cake, then?


- Another time.
- Mm-hmm.


Need I remind you, those are
as counterfeit as a two-pound note.


Quality counterfeits.


If they're good enough to fool
that nibbling owl of a man,


then we may well make it
through the season yet.


I do hope you know
what you're playing at. [scoffs]


Well, there is no need to dismiss
any staff, after all, Mrs. Varley.


Mm. Let us pray he's got
a whole trunk of them, ma'am.


One bauble does not a fortune make.


I declare, that's rather good.


I am skilled at more
than simply standing naked,


Mister...


Bridgerton. I do not doubt it.


Then perhaps inform the academy.


Although two
of the founding members are women,


we are still not yet allowed
to enter the classroom.


At least, not while we are clothed.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you work as a model


as a way of learning from the lectures?


- Ingenious.
- Care to take a turn?


It is harder than it looks.


[<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Benedict</span> inhales] Mm.


[inhales sharply] Like so?


[chuckles]


[<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Benedict</span> sighs deeply]


How long must I stay like this?


That depends.


What I really need
is a study of the male form.


The naked form.


What say you?


[water babbling]


It is a lovely spot, is it not?


It reminds me of the courtyard


at the palace where we used to live.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> calming.


[exhales deeply]


- Calming, yes.
- [chuckles softly]


Nobody would blame you
if you were to take sick, Mama,


and send apologies
for missing the dinner tonight.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury has made it quite clear


that it is necessary
for all of us to attend.


When was the last time you saw them?


The night your dear father asked
for my hand in marriage, I believe.


Lord Sheffield made it clear,


in no uncertain terms,
that he did not support the match.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I had a choice to make


between my family


and my heart.


And did you ever regret that choice?


[exhales]


From the very first moment,


your father and I were drawn together.


It is a very powerful thing


to meet someone
and feel that you know them.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> a way unlike any other.


[chuckles softly]


Still a rather high price
to pay for love, I would think.


Do not fret.


Even my parents' presence cannot mar
the happiness that is the occasion.


I had always hoped that you and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>


would be spared the choice
between affluence and love,


and now you shall.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is to wed her heart's desire.


And you have always wanted
nothing more than your freedom.


[chuckles softly]


Of course, Mama.


We shall all be perfectly happy.


- [knocking]
- [door opens]


Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield's return
is certainly a surprise. [chuckles]


But it shall be pleasant to see
the family reconciled, will it not?


I will be finished in a moment, Mother.
We shall not be late.


It is not that.


[sighs] I have been watching you all week.


I... I told myself
I would support your choice,


but I must admit,
I am finding it quite difficult


to continue to stay silent.


You have been anything but silent.


This is your betrothal, Anthony.


Your marriage.


To the woman that shall replace me
as head of this household, might I add.


You question <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>'s
suitability for the role?


I question the example
you are setting your siblings,


marrying a woman for whom you clearly
hold no great tenderness or love.


Why will you not accept that
the love match between you and father


was the exception, not the rule?


Because I wish for you two to know
the joy of an exceptional marriage.


You should be excited to wed <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>,


but for all I have seen, you act as if
you are approaching the gallows instead.


If this is not what you want,


you must say something now,
Anthony, before...


What I want is beside the point.


I could never dishonor
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> by begging off now.


You are right.


A gentleman cannot take back his word.


But a woman may.


It happens all the time with young ladies,


swept up in the dizziness
of receiving a proposal


before the reality
of marriage becomes clear.


If <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> were
to call off the engagement,


no one would find fault with her.


And you would not be dishonoring her
in the slightest,


releasing her from the obligation
before any vows were exchanged.


She does not wish to end the engagement.


But does she know
your true feelings on the matter?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> feelings are of no concern.


What matters is my responsibility,
which has always been to wed.


[softly] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> darling...


If you have doubts,
do not simply set them aside.


This is the most important choice
you will ever make.


And it would break my heart


to see you spend
the rest of your life in regret.


I dare say it would break
your father's heart too.


You seem distracted, Didi.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> sighs] Oh.


It's, uh, just a headache.


From, uh...
From all the excitement these days.


Is that all that ails you? I have seen
how ill at ease you are with the viscount.


I was hoping we had put all that behind us
now that Anthony is to be my husband.


He's asked you
to call him by his given name?


No, not yet.


But it sounds fine, does it not?


[sighs] Do you think
the Sheffields will like this dress?


[giggles] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> stomach is in a knot,
I am so excited to meet them.


Before you do,


there is something I must tell you


about your grandparents,
and how they have, in fact,


influenced our trip...


Our guests have arrived.


[giggles nervously]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury chuckles]


You may spare me
the instruction, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.


I know I am to be on my best behavior.


You think me an unfeeling harridan,


but perhaps it would surprise you to learn


that I am hosting this dinner


for your sake.


Your sister's betrothal may be the end


of certain hopes
you harbored regarding the viscount,


but access to the Sheffield fortune


would certainly be
a fine reward, would it not?


A life of independence


is no mere consolation.


Indeed, many would think it
the better prize.


After passion cools and fate intervenes,


who else is a woman left with


but herself?


Hmm.


Come along.


Our guests are waiting.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>] Hmm.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury] Hmm.


Ah, Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield,
it has been too long.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">May</span> I present <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma
and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> Sharma.


Oh, my dear, look at you.


Isn't she quite
as lovely as the report said?


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>] You are too kind.


I'm most happy to make your acquaintance.


We have been waiting
so many years to meet you.


I wish to know everything about you.


Do you enjoy dancing? Music?


You must accompany us to the opera.


We have a fine box
which has been gathering dust.


Indeed, it has been too long
since we've seen you both in town,


Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield.


- Yes.
- [<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield] Yes, indeed, it has.


Mother.


- Father.
- Mm.


I do enjoy the opera.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> sister <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> is the one
who introduced me to it.


Ah. Shall we go through to dinner?


Oh, yes. Come with me, child.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> giggles]


- [laughter]
- [silverware clinking]


And, of course, you must be
our guests at the Sheffield manor.


It is nothing compared
to the estates at Aubrey Hall,


to be sure, but I think it
a most pretty part of Hertfordshire.


Do you sh**t? We have a fine stock
of birds, and you are always welcome.


[Anthony] Thank you for the invitation.
I do enjoy sh**ting.


[Lord Sheffield] Well...


As does <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>.


The two of them almost bagged a stag
on our trip to the country.


[chuckling] How... unusual.


Do they teach
young ladies to sh**t in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>?


Only the fortunate ones.


[exhales]


Uh, Lord and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield,


how long do you plan to remain in town?


Oh, we shall stay for the wedding.


Imagine. The queen herself


overseeing my granddaughter's nuptials.


Her Majesty is kind to be so forgiving
after everything that has happened.


[Lord Sheffield] Now, now.
We are all family here.


Oh, yes, of course we are.


Even after our daughter
so callously rejected


the match we had found for her.


- [Lord Sheffield] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> dear, we agreed...
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">An</span> earl, no less, with , acres.


Any other young lady


would've fallen to her knees in gratitude
that her parents were showing such care.


This sauce is delicious, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.
Have your cook give mine the recipe.


It is the gooseberry, I believe.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield, you've got
quite the sweet tooth, I do recall?


And all for what? A mere clerk, was he?


And with a child
from a previous marriage to God-knows-who.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother has a name.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield, I must ask...


We could not show
our faces in society for years.


Not that she should care.


She simply sailed away
from all of us with that man,


robbing us of our grandchild.


Grandchildren.


I have two daughters


with whom you have had
every opportunity to form a connection.


But the choice to shun us was yours alone.


I beg your pardon...


And do not think I took it lightly,


being cast out
by the only family I had ever known.


I was heartbroken, indeed.
But in time, I came to see


that, in your cruelty,
you did us all a great service.


I hardly think this
a proper dinner conversation.


I quite agree. Please, collect...


When you cast me out,
what you did was set me free.


Free to raise my daughters
far from your constant judgment


and craven demands
that they should chase wealth


and titles above all else!


[scoffs] You are a fine one to talk.


You speak of scorning riches,
and yet you have come crawling back


to snatch at our fortune.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury is right...
- Believe me, I want nothing from you.


Oh, you may not,
but your daughter certainly does.


Mama?


The trust fund we have set up for her.
The condition of which clearly states


that she must marry a man
of good English breeding to inherit.


You did not think we would allow
another generation to pollute


the Sheffield name, did you?


Didi, what are they talking about?


- What have you done?
- Anthony, did you know about this?


I shall explain everything.


I see this one has inherited
your penchant for avoiding the truth.


Or that's something
she inherited from her father.


[Anthony] That is enough.


I can only think
you've been exiled from good society


because of your deficient manners
rather than any other sin.


Since the moment you arrived,
you have failed to show the proper respect


for the Sharma family,
and I will not stand for it.


- I declare...
- I will not... stand for it.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Mary has done admirably
in raising her daughters.


They are intelligent, kind, loyal women.


And a credit to both their parents.


And since you clearly do not wish
to jeopardize your social standing


by associating with such company,
I suggest you do not.


You may leave at once!


You cannot be serious!


Please send for Lord
and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Sheffield's carriage.


They can wait outside.


And do not trouble yourselves
for an invitation for the wedding,


for you shall not receive one.


This is beyond the pale.


And if you think
you shall inherit a single sovereign now,


you are sorely mistaken.


Lord Bridgerton, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Bridgerton.


- I must apologize...
- We should take our leave.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Violet</span>] Yes.


Thank you for the evening, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury.


It was quite enlightening.


[grunts] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> lord...


Good evening.


- You lied to me.
- Please, Bon.


Lord Bridgerton!


Lord Bridgerton, I beg a word!


- We must be going.
- Please.


[breathing heavily]


Mother, I shall meet you at the house.


You must know. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> is innocent
in all of this. She had no idea.


Coming to England, finding her a match.
I only wished the best for her.


- You cannot be angry at her.
- I am not.


It is clear she was as much in the dark
as I was about your schemes.


- They were not schemes.
- I take it there'll be no dowry.


Now that the Sheffields
have withdrawn their support.


You care about a dowry?


It is because of what you just did
that the Sheffields withdrew it.


It is regrettable, to be sure.


But clearly, both <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>
and I have been misled,


and it is best to call off
this doomed engagement


before it is the cause of any more strife.


Of course, I'd never
besmirch her reputation.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> mother and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Danbury
will make a plan...


There shall be no plan.
I do not understand.


Why are you suggesting this?


All along, you have been set
on marrying my sister,


despite my every objection, might I add,


and now you intend to cast her aside.


Why?


And do not talk to me of dowries, sir,


for we both know you have no need of it.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, tell me, what has she done?


She has done nothing. It is you.
You have made this match impossible.


- But I am leaving for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">India</span>.
- And it is not far enough!


Do you think that there is
a corner of this Earth


that you could travel to far away enough


to free me from this torment?


I am a gentleman.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> father raised me to act with honor,
but that honor is hanging by a thread


that grows more precarious
with every moment


I spend in your presence.


You are the bane of my existence.


And the object of all my desires.


[quietly] Night and day, I dream of you.


And what I... [exhales]


Do you even know all the ways
a lady can be seduced?


The things I could teach you.


[both breathing heavily]


[quietly] I did not ask for this.


[sighs] To be plagued by these feelings.


Hiding from my sister.


Being driven to distraction
every time you enter the room.


Then you agree.


It is insupportable.


Impossible.


[heartbeats thumping]


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span> exhales]


If I wed your sister, it will bind me
and you together for eternity,


and I will spend every day of my marriage


wanting you,


dreaming of you,


dreading the day when my last thread
of honor finally snaps.


Is that the future that you want for us?


For your sister?


[exhales]


[distant chatter]


I must go.


[exhales sharply]


[sighs] Must we sit around like statues?


I wish to be at a ball,
showing off my new fiancé.


Varley?


Are you certain we've not received


any invitations you may have
overlooked for the evening?


No, ma'am. There's been nothing.


Perhaps the circumstances of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span>'s
engagement has us on the outs yet again.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> this is my fault?


I did not say that.


It's not as if you arranged to meet
Cousin Jack in that orangery, did you?


We should merely be happy we still have
a cook and a lady's maid each, yes, Mama?


Not a single invitation
since arriving back from the country.


I shall alert the postal clerk.


This is no joke.


We are meant to be a distinguished family.


But for years, I have suffered
the indignities of the ton's disdain,


for one reason or another.


They liked us well enough
when they thought you a plum catch,


but now that you are spoken for,
ah, we are outcasts again.


All the more reason to end
this sham of an engagement.


It is not an option.


Lord Cowper.


What business did he have with you?


He wishes to invest in the mines.
Several of them do.


Bored gentlemen with too much time
and money on their hands.


- Take it.
- The mines are worthless.


There are no rubies to be found.


How are they to know the difference?
Board a ship to the Americas?


[chuckles, inhales]


You are serious.


The future of this family
hangs in the balance, my lord.


I've never been more serious in my life.


Get them to invest.
Take every pound that they offer.


Our fortunes will be restored.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Prudence</span> shall have a fine wedding,


and I shall never have to suffer
the disdain of the ton again.


- [knocking]
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>?


Ever since the viscount
has been courting me,


I have sensed
you were not being entirely truthful.


And now I know I was right.


This business with the Sheffields
and their fortune,


you did not trust me enough
to tell me what was really going on.


I am truly sorry, Bon, for keeping
both you and Mama in the dark.


After Appa d*ed,


I took it upon myself
to manage our affairs.


I wrote to the Sheffields,
and after learning of their stipulations,


I saw an answer to all our troubles.


I thought I was doing the right thing


by keeping you free from this burden.


But you must know,


it has weighed on me every day.


I am not a little girl anymore, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Kate</span>.


I am a grown woman now,
ready to be a wife.


Yes.


Yes, I know.


[sighs softly]


If Lord Bridgerton does not wish
to end our engagement...


then the Sheffield fortune
would not matter, would it?


Once I am married to the viscount,


there will be ample funds
to provide for all of us.


He is as generous as he is wealthy.


I am sure the viscount
will provide for you and Mama too.


He...


He might.


But... But, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span>,
this should not be your burden.


What burden would it be
to marry the person I love?


You love him?


Watching how nobly he defended us
at dinner tonight, how could I not?


I want nothing more than to be his wife.


His viscountess.


But he will have to forgive us.


Do you think he will?


That I do not know.


I shall not be long.


Do not tell me
you've traveled at this ungodly hour


to offer more corrections of my writing?


It was the only time
I could leave without being seen.


And, on the contrary,


I've come to ask for your discernment.


Is that so?


Do not look so pleased.


It is a rare occurrence
that I doubt shall be repeated.


[sighs] I have questions
about the writings in this pamphlet.


Well, the ideas can tax a fragile mind.


Or perhaps your means of communicating
them leaves much to be desired.


Or perhaps you have not seen enough
of the world to make sense of them yet.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eloise</span> chuckling] Ah.


[<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lady</span> Whistledown] Duty.


More than laws or faith,
I have often thought it the bond


that holds our fragile society together.


Duty to rank and title.


Fidelity to one's family name.


It demands both utter obedience


and total sacrifice.


But what happens


when such duty


is in conflict
with the heart's true desire?


Why, then, there is the potential


for a considerable scandal, indeed.


The only question is,


will the parties in question
heed my warning?


Or is it already too late


to turn back to duty


and away from desire?


[classical rendition of
"You Oughta Know" plays]


[breathing deeply]


[horse snorts]


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma.


I see you continue here
with your morning rides.


As do you, it seems.


I couldn't sleep.


[quietly] Nor could I.


Have you decided what you will do?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Long</span> have I wrestled with it,
but I see no other option.


I will talk with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> today...


and see my way to ending things.


It is the only way to ensure


that the two of us can be rid
of this impossible situation.


Once the engagement is over,
our paths need never cross again.


It will be as if we had never met.


You cannot. You cannot do that.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Sharma...
- You cannot break my sister's heart.


She is all things good and true.
A kinder soul you will never find.


She has loved me
as well as any sister could,


and I could not live with myself


if I robbed her of her happiness
and the future she deserves.


I... I do not understand.


You have been
against this union from the start.


I was wrong! I will not be
the cause of you losing your honor


any more than I can stand
to see <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Edwina</span> in pain.


You once saw her as your perfect match.


You will find your way
to believing it again.


Please.


Please, Lord Bridgerton.


Anthony.


You must keep your word.
You must marry my sister.


You must marry her as soon as you can,


because this feeling
that plagues us so, it will pass.


It will become tenable,
it will become bearable,


and soon enough,
it will be as if we never felt it at all.


Mere passion. It must because it has to.


[classical rendition of
"You Oughta Know" continues]


[sighs]


Very well.


I shall see that the wedding
shall take place as soon as possible.


[sighs deeply]


[sniffles]


[exhales sharply]

<@#<b>(USA) You Season 2 Episode 7.txt</b>#@><br />
﻿It's weird,


the things you do
when you're broken up with.


I considered stepping
in front of a car the other day


just so you'd look at me.


I know, I should run.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Candace</span> could storm in
with a SWAT team at any moment,


and, honestly, it would be a convenience.


Everything hurts,
and nothing is okay without you, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


You... don't make it easy to check in.


I'm shut out, and you want me to know it.


I just want to know you're okay, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.
And, maybe, to know you're hurting too.


Goddamn curtains.


I...


What the...?


Who the fuck is that?


There are a lot of seedy characters
in this town, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


It's a good thing you moved
your spare key to... to the bird house!


Shit. Shit.


If I go over there,
you'll know I was watching.


If I don't... Oh, damn it.


I get it now.


The curtains aren't to shut me out.


They're a kindness
because you've already moved on.


Okay.


Not so long ago,


that was me,
with your fingers in my mouth.


Me, eating your delicious cooking.


Me, tasting the food in your mouth


when you couldn't wait
till after you'd swallowed to kiss me.


Didn't think you were one for pretty boys.


Could you really be
into all those muscles?


Who is this monster?


That...


is <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>.


It's not really my business.


- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span> what?
- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span> fucking Warrington.


You know,
he used to be James's best friend.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>'s late husband James?


Exactly.


He just spent two years traversing <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Asia</span>


so he could sprinkle James's ashes
all over the Himalayas.


And now he's back,


traversing <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>'s vagina. Again.


'Cause he does that periodically.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> he's a...
- Scumbag.


I would Poltergeist the shit out of him
if I was James.


I need answers, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


Well, maybe it's a comfort thing.


I mean, they've both been
through something terrible.


Yeah.


Maybe for her, it is.


But he's been sweet on her since college.


He could not stand it
when she chose James.


And then guess who was Mr. Attentive
at the funeral?


Yeah. He stayed for weeks after.


Cooked, cleaned, bathed her,


went down on her every night.


Nobody does that shit out
of the kindness of their own heart, Joe.


He was preying on her


when she was vulnerable.


And now he's doing it again.


Picking up the pieces
when your body's barely cold.


He's a predator,
and you're falling for it, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t worry, sport,
she's not falling for it.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> will give herself permission to do
what she needs to do to heal,


but she is still very broken up over you.


She does not look very broken up.


Challenge accepted.


Watch this.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span> Warrington,


Australian Zen Buddhist travel blogger


with a penchant for holding baby animals
with his shirt off.


Sponsored by Patagonia,


which is easier
when your dad owns Patagonia.


He free-climbs, plays guitar,
trains horses,


volunteers in third-world countries?


No, he's too perfect. No guy like this
actually exists outside a romance novel.


I smell a fraud.


And you look too enchanted, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


What's up?


Really? Bringing Mr. Didgeridon't
around just for Joe to see?


It's all a little <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Dottie</span> of you.


You cannot possibly be into him.


Okay, first of all, never compare me
to Mom again.


And secondly, I'm actually into him.


No, this is good for me.


And I don't need you coming in
on behalf of <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>,


or... Joe,
or whatever the fuck his name is,


trying to make me feel
some type of way about it, okay?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span> is good. At least he's honest.


Is he, though?


Do me a favor.
Focus on your own shit, okay?


Move to the light, as <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Dottie</span> would say.


- Hey, Forty.
- Hi, Salami Nips.


As I suspected, she is not over you.


- Did she say that?
- She did not need to.


This is what <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> does when she's hurting.


She, like, gets a little basic


and pretends to like things
that she definitely does not like


in order to seem normal.


And also, it's the only time
that she'll snap at me. It's a tell.


Makes sense.


When I was getting over Beck,
I glommed onto <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Karen</span> Minty.


Good, but wrong for me.


Is that who <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span> is? Is he your <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Karen</span>?


Okay, so you know
what you have to do now, right?


Get back on the horse,
start dating around,


show <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> how free
and happy you're living.


She will hate that.


I'm not the vindictive type.


And she's not really the jealous type.


Oh! I'm sorry,
did the two of you share a womb?


Yeah, trust me, okay? She gets jealous.


Now let's set you up.


Forty.


Why are you helping me?
I lied to your sister.


I lied to you.


I tangled you up in this...
this <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Amy</span>-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Candace</span> mess.


Hey. As Shakespeare once said,


"Bitcheth was crazy."


You lied out of necessity. Okay?


That guy is a pie-hunting snake


in Tarzan's body,
and I do not trust him.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gut says you're good,


he's bad, case dismissed.


I'm starting to see what you see
in Forty. He is smart.


And he loves you hard. I get that.


All right. I need something good
for your Flingr profile.


Spit me some literature, please.


Flingr?


You are not putting this poor,
innocent man on there.


I suggest <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Magnolia</span>.


It's mostly queer,


but straight girls troll
for gays to beard,


- and they are aggressive as fuck.
- Oh.


I know it's a deeper conversation,
but I'm just saying,


- I could have all the pussy I could...
- Eat.


Eat... or whatever.
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, by all means, you take it.


Goldleaf is another good one.


It's only for celebrities,
so we would need to get you verified,


but, uh, it's safer for people like us.


You up on the lingo?


"PnP," whatnot?


"Party and play," a.k.a. drugs and sex?


Oh! If someone hits you
with a "What's up," capital T,


that means "<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Tina</span>," which means meth.


- Why is <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Tina</span> meth?
- Oh, and you definitely need to watch


for kitten-fishing thirst traps.


- What?
- Pictures.


Like, if it's a close-up head shot,
she's fat.


If it's a group shot, she's, like,
really insecure,


but, like, wants to seem fun.
And if she has a pixie cut...


- Oh, and...
- Okay.


Thank you both. Wow.
That's a lot to think about.


And I will.


Thoughts?


Chum in the water.


You know, I gotta hand it to this
guy, he takes a gorgeous picture.


Not that it's difficult


when the subject is you.


Uh, what was that?
No. Did I just like his photo of you?


- Son of a...
- Hey, creep.


- Hey.
- Do me a favor.


Instead of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>,
fuck anything else. Cool?


How... Why do you know about that?


Just be a normal person


and rebound on Flingr
instead of your literal neighbor.


- Can you do that?
- Elle?


Can you scrounge up some more quarters?
We need three more.


Fine.


But if I come back
and witness anything nasty,


I'm running away forever.


- Hi.
- Apartment three.


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>, I'm sorry, I...
- Stop, it's no big deal. Okay?


You can stop avoiding me


and pay your fucking rent
because it's late.


- That's right. I'm sorry.
- And stop apologizing.


Okay.


But, hey, Flingr is a great idea


because you clearly need some training
on how to be a single human man in LA.


Noted.


What's that,
four people now suggesting Flingr?


Do I smell desperate?


Maybe I do.


Bye, creep.


Here are your quarters.


Why do you hate <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>?


I mean, he's grumpy, and I give him shit
'cause I kinda hate him,


- but, I don't...
- I don't hate him.


Ever think maybe it's because I like him,
I don't want things to blow up?


Which you know will happen.


Then he'll have to move,
or we'll have to move, and it just...


Can't things just be simple for once?


Fair enough.


"Ten Dating Apps
for Those Who Hate Dating Apps."


And the profiles of several
rather promiscuous-looking ladies.


Out of pure, morbid curiosity.


I know these apps are helpful


and there are success stories,


but how lazy and anti-feminist is this?


Swipe yes or no based off of a glance


at a retouched selfie? It's barbaric.


Bring me the days
when a man would ride horseback


for hours just to sit beside a woman


for tea, without the promise
of a graze of a single finger.


Some of the pictures
don't even have faces in it.


And what the hell is "cuffing season"?


"Sonnet2Me."


"Hmm." The App for Readers.


Less photo-based, more conversational.


"For those interested in getting to know
someone who actually reads."


Mmm, okay. I'll bite.


What's in a name, indeed.


Oh, the saga
of <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> Bettelheim must continue.


Joe and his heart are reserved
for one person.


Are you really the jealous type, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>?


I guess we'll see.


What are your favorite books?


Total honesty, I'm not the biggest reader.


I just really want to date a guy who is.


4-Hour Workweek changed my life.
You should read it.


Anything Tolstoy.


And Bukowski.


Bit of a romantic.


What's your story?


- I moved here a few months ago.
- For the industry?


Me too!


From where? What are your goals?


Any fetishes I should know about?


"But you can't get away from yourself,


moving from one place to another."


That's... The <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sun</span> Also Rises.

It's very sexy.


I couldn't agree more.


Uh, cheers.


Higher.


It's in portrait mode, right?


I'll get the room. You walk in two steps,


get on your knees, we fuck,
you leave, no talking.

Thanks to Forty's constant reposts


to his Stories, I can see you've been
looking at my profile, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>,


but choosing not to engage.


Now that's a sign, right? You're jealous.


Oh, my God.


- You went all the way to <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Glendora</span>?
- Yeah, of course.


Meanwhile, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>'s account
is getting more and more intimate.


And now you're eating sex crime donuts
with him and not me.


- Hey, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>.
- Hey.


- What are you doing?
- I'm... I'm just reorganizing. Per Forty.


Is that the garbage?


- Yeah.
- Oh. I got it.


- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm already back here.


Okay, thanks.


What did you want to talk to me about?


Well, as you know, I go to Bali next week,


and I should be there
for about ten months.


Mm-hmm?


Yeah, you said you were really excited.


This is the moment he asks
you to come.


He's trying to Peach you,


- and I have the pleasure of hearing it.
- Well,


not anymore.


I'm tired of traveling.
And this,


you and me,
has been really good, hasn't it?


- Oh, no.
- Yeah, it's great.


Right. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, I'm thinking,


what if I stick around a while?


What if you and me give this a real shot?


I want you to be my girlfriend, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


I'm sorry...


Just a little dry.


Wow.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>, that's, um...


I don't want you to make that decision
because of me.


But if staying in LA feels right, then...


you should.


Okay.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, the big guy is sticking around
like a stupid fucking boomerang.


Do you want to be his girlfriend, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>?


Enjoy. I hear the beaches
in Manila are beautiful.


Hey.


Hey.


I heard you're... online dating.


Forty told me twice


- or, like, 100 times.
- Yeah.


- He's very supportive, I guess.
- It's going well?


You are curious.


It is, actually. Yeah, I mean, it's all...


That's really great.


I'm glad
you're putting yourself out there.


I was just also curious.
What name are you using? <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> or Joe?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>.


Interesting.


Forty was wrong.


You aren't jealous. You are disgusted.


And I don't blame you.


While I've been on a fool's errand
of pointless dates,


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span> has leveled up,
and you are falling for it.


I think I've been putting my attention
in the wrong place.


Is it the Avengers bod?


Or the "born into old money
but went the New-Age route" thing?


Oh, is it the sex?


Damn. This is really uphill.


Is it his lung capacity, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>?


- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>?
- Shit.


Of course, your best friend, now.


Gabe! Man, what...


That's crazy. I just saw, um, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>.
He, you know, he's...


It's a coincidence. I guess he's hiking.
Everybody's hiking today.


- You hike often?
- Uh...


I'm getting into it, yeah.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>, I have
an especially potent bullshit detector.


You mind if we just sidestep
these forced niceties?


Stop the little white lies.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> values radical,
it-hurts-even-to-say-it honesty


above anything else.


And she caught you in a fucking whopper.


I know.


- I know...
- That being said,


in almost ten years of our friendship,


I don't think she has ever talked
about someone


the way that she has talked about you.


Not even James.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I think there's still hope.


But this whole Flingr-whore,
jealous stalker thing,


it is not a good look.


You wanna know
why <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> is so attracted to <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>?


- Yes.
- He worked on himself.


Damage attracts damage.
Healthy people like healthy people.


- What if I'm damaged?
- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Honey</span>...


everybody came here because they are.


The point is what you do with it.


Maybe it's time you faced this
like a true Angeleno, hmm?


Terrified to know what this means.


Come along.


How are you feeling?


Crazy.


Nervous.


What are you afraid of?


That one of these will graze a
nerve, and I'll become Sloth from Goonies.


Um...


I don't know.


Ow.


What are you afraid of?


I don't know, I'm afraid this won't work.


That is what you thought I wanted to hear.


What are you afraid of?


Okay. Breathe.


Think. Answer honestly
because your psycho friend Gabe


is a human lie detector.


I'm afraid...


this will work.


And?


I'll say something... true.


Something bad.


You'll tell <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


And I'll lose her forever.


What is in these needles?


The truth does not scare <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


This would.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>, your friend is a sorcerer.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, you believe your truth...


makes you unworthy of love?


I need to stop talking now.


Yes.


And, therefore, unworthy of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


Yes.


- Mommy?
- Joe.


Baby.


- Get in here.
- I was afraid you left.


I'm so sorry.


What's happening?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> home is you.


Who would you be
if you didn't have anyone to love?


Joey, you're such a good boy.


What did you lose...


that makes you chase love so much?


Today's the day.


We're getting out of here.


Where are we going?


I don't know yet.


But we're never gonna see him again. Okay?


I'm sorry I did this to you.


I thought he'd be better this time,


but he was worse.


We're done.


We're out.


- What are we?
- Out.


That's right. Pack your stuff.


Take only the important things,
none of those books.


You hear me?


Okay, you can take one.


I'm gonna go to the bank,
and I'll be back at four to get you.


And it'll be just the two of us.


As long as we're together,


we'll always be home.


You have been in the pursuit of someone
to love and care for for all of your life.


What if...


you were that person?


What if you're all that you need?


Say it with me, "I..."


- I...
- "...am all I need."


...am all I need.


Again.


I am all I need.


How are you feeling?


Free.


Full.


It's the power of self-love.


As Mama Ru says,


"If you cannot love yourself,


how in the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?"


Hm.


Okay, easy.


Easy now. You're gonna feel
a little out-of-body for a while.


All right?


You're a wizard.


Thank you.


But this is not a cure-all.


It's a practice.


You're still gonna experience
dark thoughts and emotions.


What is important
is that you follow it up with,


"And I'm okay with that."


"I'm okay with that."


Good. Good, good.


It's also important
you keep that temple clean, okay?


I'm gonna suggest
a quick seven-day cleanse.


Eew!


Dude, I love green juice,
but celery is basically Satan's butt plug.


It's not that bad.


Oh, I can't look at you
while you drink that.


But we do need to chat, re: D-FOL.


We gotta find a big name to play Beck.
Or maybe...


we take the auditions on the road.
Like, look for our <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Scarlett</span> O'Hara.


Do you have any thoughts?


It's kind of nice how Forty
sabotages his own process so much.


It takes it out of my hands entirely.


Shouldn't we write a script first?


What you writing?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellie</span>, what are you doing here?


Checking in to see
how the dating world's treating you.


Being neighborly.


I don't buy it.


Celery juice?


Ugh, what is wrong with you?


This kid knows what's up.


He's on a juice cleanse,
trying to fix himself, win back my sister.


Flingr was a bust, huh?


The kid is <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellie</span> Alves, by the way.


Read in the trades you acquired
a pretty big piece of IP, Forty Quinn.


Trades?


Yeah,
I had my agent put out a press release.


Shit. Fuck. Damn it, Forty.


If you need any help with development,
I'm really good with coverage and notes.


And there's the real reason
she's here. Little opportunist.


- What are you, 12?
- I'm almost 16,


and I can guarantee you
I know more about film


than any idiot assistant
to come out of WME.


- Oh, here we go.
- All right, Hermione,


who was originally supposed to play
the Terminator?


OJ Simpson, but James Cameron thought
he looked too nice to play a killer.


What's the longest narrative film shoot
in history?


- Boyhood, 12 years.
- Not even close.


The Thief and the Cobbler, 29 years.


- Doesn't count. It's not live-action.
- Not what I asked.


Okay.


Okay.


What say you, sport?
Should we hire ourselves an intern?


Well, Forty's no Henderson.


And Little <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> Ballsy
is bound to find opportunity elsewhere.


Probably with less honorable people.


The devil you know, right?


Fine.


After homework,


limited hours,
only with <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>'s written permission.


Okay, Dad.


Beautiful and artful,
though a bit of a violation.


Because I know
you would've never consented to this.


Uh, not my business.


If you want to be with someone
who posts intimate pictures


without your knowledge for millions
to enjoy, it's your choice, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


And I'm okay with that.


- Hey.
- Hey.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>, remember how you mansplained to me
that I should write my Henderson story?


Vividly.


Am I sweating? Why am I sweating?


Well, I'm not saying I did it,


but if I had written it and submitted it,


I might have gotten confirmation
that it's gonna be published


in Variety fucking magazine.


Holy shit, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>! That's so great.


Let's be clear, though,
this is not a thank-you.


I will never thank you. Clear?


- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>...
- What is happening here?


Yeah. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> clear.


What is happening here? Are you...


Oh, my God.


Oh, my God. That is so good.


Mmm.


It's Meyer lemon and plum curd
and Italian buttercream.


Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> favorite so far.


You've said that
about all of them.


And I meant it every time.


Sunrise and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Lucy</span> will be stoked
with any of these, babe.


You're...


incredible.


Thanks.


But if you call me "babe" again,
I'm gonna stick you in the oven.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>...


I found a place.


Little bungalow in Atwater.


Close enough I can jog to you,
but not so close it's clingy.


- What about...
- I canceled Bali.


You said if it felt right for me to stay,
then I should.


And... this feels right.


I want to see where this goes.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>, I care about you a lot.


And this has been great.


I just...


I like the way things are.


I'm not sure
I'm ready to change the dynamic.


The dynamic where you call me
when you need to get over another guy?


Yes. But it's not just that.


You, more than anyone,
know that I am a package deal.


Forty...


he needs me.


He's working on this film, which,
quite frankly, is bound to fail


because they all do.


And when he does, he'll implode.


I can feel it.


It's just like the earthquake.
We all know the big one is coming.


- He's a grown man, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.
- But he's not, really.


One thing I love is your honesty.


Maybe it's time to get honest
with how codependent you are with him.


Hey, look.


I'm... falling in love with you.


And it's okay if you're not there yet.


I can wait.


Just... let me.


Please.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>? <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>, wake up.


Oh!


What happened?


You Exorcist-vomited
all over my favorite top


and then passed out.


Oh.


Same thing happened to me
a couple years ago


when I read that celery
was negative calories.


I ate nothing else for three days


and then projectile barfed
all over my own birthday cake.


- Oh.
- Enough of this juice shit.


I'm ordering burgers and shakes.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>?


Ugh.


It's hard to read.


But I still couldn't put it down.


It's incredible.


Well, don't sound so surprised.


It's weird
how powerful vulnerability can feel.


I don't think I would've had the guts
if you hadn't angered me into it.


Still not a thank-you.


You know you can always count on me
to say the wrong thing.


If I told you I was proud,
would you want to hurt me?


- Probably.
- Okay.


- Yeah.
- Well.


I'm definitely not proud of you.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>... did you really think you
were gonna juice your way


back into <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span> Quinn's heart?


Wasn't about her.


Not really.


What? You trying to reach
your goal weight?


Just want to clear the noise.


Did it work?


I don't know.


Maybe I'm cynical, but I...


really don't think any of that stuff works
for anyone who's truly broken.


Serves us better
to just keep barreling forward


and hope the demons can't keep up.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>...


might as well be who you are.


This is not outrunning demons.


This is slaying them.


- No thanks to you.
- Zero thanks to me.


Nice to meet the real you, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>.


You're really quite beautiful.


Oh, no.


This is good.


Everything's better with a little whiskey.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> fact,


this night could do
with a little bit more.


You up for a walk?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> first impression of you was...


weirdo.


Oh, come on, you can't be surprised.


- You had no social media.
- Oh!


You show up with a backpack, all New York.


Most people show up
like overeager labradoodles.


I couldn't pull shit out of you.


Almost like you were purposely trying
to have no personality whatsoever.


Ow!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> vino veritas.


Hey, you asked for it.


Okay, my turn.


What was your first impression of me?


Be honest.


- Definitely do not be honest.
- I thought you seemed nice.


Okay, you're such a liar.


Why don't you wash your mouth out,
try again. Veritas.


Oh, well, here goes.


I thought you seemed sad.


I could see how much you had
on your shoulders.


It's a lot.


Also, I have this bad habit
of trying to fix people.


Thus, the unfriendly New Yorker.
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I'm sorry about that.


Hey...


Stop apologizing.


You still think I'm a weirdo?


I mean, I always trust first impressions.


Thing is,


I like weirdos.


Damaged finds damaged.


Every time.


Fuck me.


David Fincher.


Come on. He's a personal friend.


Can we just get him in here,


so we don't have to do
the whole phone call thing?


No? Okay.


What if they take fingerprints?
What if they take DNA?


Not like there's a crusty jar of piss
in Peach Salinger's house or anything.


Guard's playing deaf and dumb.
It was worth a try, though.


What a night, huh?


How long do you think they'll keep us
in here?


I don't know.
I think it's like a six-hour hold.


And then they take our fingerprints
and shit.


Shit, shit, shit.


Are you okay?


- I just...
- Benji, Peach, Beck, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Jasper</span>, Hendy.


...don't like confined spaces.


Okay. Well, don't worry.


I got this.


Is this really your first time
being arrested?


Is it not yours?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>.


Fincher, thank God!


Really?


Can you get us out of here?
It was just a big misunderstanding.


We were barely tipsy.
We weren't even driving...


I heard why they brought you in.


That doesn't sound


- like a misunderstanding to me.
- Finch.


You need a lawyer.


I'm sorry, but, uh...


I can't help you.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>, you know anybody with pull
who isn't a jealous fuck?


It's no problem, sport.
I have a guy for these things.


Just sit tight. Oh, and, hey...


I'm so proud of you.


Oh, my God. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> an alley.


Bettelheim. Alves.
You're next for processing.


Fab.


Mexico's only a few hours away.


I could start there.
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> did say I'd like it. Then go south.


Keep going.


There you go.


All right, let's go, D.


You and your friend are free to go.


Apparently,
you have some pretty powerful friends,


William Bettelheim.


Thank you, Officer.


Wait, I know you.


Yeah, he's my neighbor.


You've probably seen him
around the building.


Thanks for your help.


Is that it?


If not, I know where to find you.


Well, the sun's already up.


It's beautiful.


I actually have to get to work,


but thank you


for a night I will not soon forget.


Yeah, that was fun.


Should probs stick to friendship
from now on, though.


For <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellie</span>.


Friends?


You're such an idiot.


Are you guys fucking kidding me?


Elle, I...


You left me alone all night
so you could get laid?


Why do you have to be such a slut?


Friends.


Indecent exposure.


It's a really good title for something.
It kind of rolls off the tongue.


Indecent exposure.


I'm not telling you anything.


How lewd... conduct.


Hey, gents.


Salami.


You don't like surprises.
And you hate roses.


She hates roses.


It's like he's not even trying,


and yet, somehow he still tries too hard.


- Later, fellas.
- Bye, Vagemite.


Oh, hey,


really looking forward
to your next failed attempt


to lock down my sister.


I'm loving the enthusiasm.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t do it.


Forty...


I know it's not easy for you
when <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>'s attention's on someone else.


But I'm gonna be around,
so it'd be nice if we could be cordial


like adults.


Your sister and I are happy.


And it'd nice if you could be happy
for her, too. Huh, champ?


Shit.


Interesting. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>, the way that I see it,


you're not gonna be around long, at all.


'Cause you're a Neanderthal.


Wow, when are you gonna grow up?


When are you gonna realize that
natural deodorant is not working for you?


Guys, let's take it down.


What's going on?


You're the reason why <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>
can't do anything good with her life.


You're a fucking albatross
around her neck.


- <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>...
- I wonder what James,


your best friend, is thinking,
sitting up in heaven,


watching you fingerbang his wife
'cause you can't keep your dick hard.


Hey!


Oh, my God. Forty.


That's enough.


Get the fuck out, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Milo</span>!


He started it!


- Oh, grow up!
- Me?


I've been biting my tongue
for a long time.


But maybe if you paid less attention
to your idiot brother,


and more attention to what's actually
in front of you,


you might've noticed sooner
that James was sick.


She said get out.


Yeah? What are you gonna do?


Be a big man?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hope</span> she takes you back?


What?


I remembered
where I knew your friend from.


Great. Bye.


Stopped him for jaywalking,
right outside your place.


Pulled some limited-edition headphones
off him.


Really? You were that cop?


He was throwing them away, D.


William Bettelheim
drives a beater Honda Civic


and makes $12 an hour working
at a grocery store.


Those headphones alone cost
more than he makes in a week.


You ran a background check, Finch?
What the hell is wrong with you?


Listen, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>, that was the same night
that Henderson was murdered.


What's a guy with no real money,
no assets doing,


getting rid of $600 headphones


at 4:00 a.m.
the same night a celebrity was killed?


The same celebrity


who is the spokesperson
for those fucking headphones?


Okay, just stop, Alex Jones.


Look, I know you didn't like seeing me
with another dude,


but this look is not cute.


If you wanna be exclusive,


you can ask me out on a real date,
and then we'll talk.


But I'm not entertaining your ego anymore.
Goodbye.


No, D.


Doesn't mean anything.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> skirt was pulled up.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you're saying Henderson...


- Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.
- How much did you pay <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span> to follow me?


Just wanted to make sure you got
that envelope on your doorstep.


- How did you know about that?
- This is quite a who's who.


- Oh, look, I made the cut.
- Apparently,


you have some pretty powerful friends,


William Bettelheim.


There's no way.


You see? Nothing.


All right.


Hey.


That was the most disgusting display
of toxic masculinity.


Okay, I don't need you, or you,
or anybody to defend me,


or my honor, or whatever you think
makes you entitled


- to do what you just did.
- Okay.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Miss</span> "Sic the PI on my Girlfriend
for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> Protection,"


retract the claws,
lest you scratch yourself with hypocrisy.


Yeah. We're all a bunch of assholes.


Yeah, you're right. It wasn't our place.


I'm sorry.


I'm sorry too.


We just...
We love you too much. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t we, sport?


Always.


I should get going. I have dinner plans.


Another date?


It's just dinner with a friend.


Hey.


You're a good friend...


Joe.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> name.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> real name in your mouth is like poetry.


No matter what happens,


no matter how much self-work I do,


a part of me will always miss the home
that is you.


And I'm okay with that, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Love</span>.


What in the actual... fuck?


Holy shit, perv!


Ew.


Oh.


Hey, Finch, it's me. Uh...


Just call me back.


I got a nanny cam


in my apartment
when my crazy ex... broke in.


I was gonna ask
if you wanted to have dinner tonight.


Until I saw you'd already been by.


And found some keys.


Give me the phone.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t make me take it.


What are you gonna do?


I will scream.


It's soundproof.


Just think about <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellie</span>.


She will be alone.


Hey, booger.


This is Dale.


Say hi.


Come on. Get in the car.


Your dad will be home any minute.


You said it would just be us.


How exactly did you think
that was gonna happen?


Come on. I don't have time for this.
Get in, Joey.


Get in the car.


No.


Oh, no, no, no.


No, no, no!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t panic.


I'm not gonna hurt you.


I would never do anything
to hurt you or <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellie</span>.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Will</span>, please, do not leave me in here!


I just need to make some arrangements,
and you will never see me again.


I promise you and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ellie</span> will be fine.


Together.


I just need you to trust me.


Can you trust me, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Delilah</span>?<br />
<br />

﻿<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.


Yes?


When I go back down to Gongjin,
can you meet up with me?


Meet up?


Of course, I can.


I really hope you can.


I have something to tell you.


What?


They fixed the streetlamp.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, are you there?


Yes, I am.






Let me know when you're back.


I'll treat you to a meal.


Okay. I'll see you soon.


Okay. Drive safely.


-I will.
-Bye.


Who are you?


Who said you could enter my home?


We have a home security system.
The police will be here in no time.


I know there's no security system here.


I had it installed yesterday.


-What are you doing with your phone?
-What?


Are you calling the police?


There's no one to help you now.


What the hell?






<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t make a sound.


It's a great night
to catch a sick pervert.


Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?


-Did he hurt you?
-No.


-Are you really okay?
-I'm so terrified.


Yes, this is 14 Abnaru-gil, Gongjin-dong.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin!


Chief Hong!


Chief Hong!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


-What on earth happened?
-It was the damn pervert.


He deserves to rot in prison.


That was a close one.


-He should rot in jail.
-Watch your head.


-Can you believe it?
-What the hell?


EPISODE 10


There wasn't any nerve damage,
so stitches will be enough.


I'll get back to you soon.


Thank you, doctor.


What a relief.


Doesn't it hurt?


Of course it does.
Even paper cuts hurt like hell,


but the knife was this big.
At least 30cm, right?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t exaggerate.


It was a paring knife
with a blade length of around 15cm.


I thought you'd still be in shock,


but the doctor in you
calmed you down already.


That bruise. Did he hurt you?


Oh, it's nothing.


What are you talking about?
You're hurt. Let me see.


How bad is it? Does it hurt?


Why didn't you tell the doctor
when he was here?


Your injury is much worse.


Ms. Dentist.


Why are you crying?


Gosh, I was so scared.


Who jumps at a guy


with a knife in his hand?


I was just…


I was afraid he might hurt you.


Seriously.


Seong-hyeon?


Director <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, are you all right?


How did you know I was here?


Oh, well…


I came back to pick something up


then saw police cars
and your neighbors near your place.


I rushed over here
as soon as I heard about you two.


-I see.
-Right.


Chief Hong, is the injury serious?


No, it's only a graze.


You seem more shocked than we are though.
Are you okay?


Me? No, I'm okay.


I was really worried.


I'm so relieved that you two are okay.


Well, I…


I came back…


because I forgot my tablet.


I need to head back up with my hard drive.


Now that I know you're okay,
I'll get going.


At this hour?


Yes. You must be really shocked,
so take good care of yourself.


Chief Hong, thank you
for saving <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin. I mean it.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t mention it.


I'll get going then.


Right. Seong-hyeon--


We're ready for you. I'm afraid
only one guardian's allowed to stay.


Go receive your treatment.


Sure.


You jumped in front of a knife,
but you're afraid of needles?


Anyone who has been burned by hot soup
flinches at the sight of it.


Thank you.


That was out of the blue.


I don't think


I thanked you officially yet.


You did unofficially though.


Look at me.
The way you've been looking at me.


It's been shooting out words of gratitude.


That's ridiculous.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what now?


What do you mean?


About tonight.
Your place is now a crime scene.


Oh, right.


Welcome, it's your…
No, it's not your first time.


It's my third.


As you know, three is a lucky number.


Like samseon jjajangmyeon


and best-of-three set matches.


And they say the third daughter is
always the prettiest.


That's so silly.


Anyway, it's better
than staying home alone tonight.


Ms. Pyo went to Seoul, right?


Yes.


Make yourself at home
and let me know if you need anything.


I need clothes to change into.


Right.


Should I go fetch some from your place?


Or would you like to wear
something of mine?


Would they fit?


-Would they be too small?
-Probably too big.


I see you're done.


The clothes are too big for me.


They are not. They fit you like a glove.


You know, you have such broad shoulders.


What do you mean?
It's clearly too big on me.


It's just that you have narrow shoulders.
They fit just right.


You just have to have the last word.


Anyway, drink this.


What is it?


Chamomile tea. Nothing's better
for relaxation and good sleep.


Drink while it's hot.


It'd better be good.


-What is this?
-Keep it on you.


It's easy to get aches
on a night like this.


Your muscles must be in shock.


Why do I need a blanket
on such a hot summer night?


I'm good.


You've got cramp.
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span>? This is what I was talking about?


Let me see. Does it hurt a lot?


What are you doing?


Didn't you wash your feet?


Of course I did.


Then stay still.


The spasm will get worse
if you don't treat it right away.


Meow if you don't have
anything better to do.


Meow…


Lick your nose too.


Forget it. You can stop now.
I think I'm good.


Really? Are you sure?


Yes.


All right.


What's with the special plates?
Is it someone's memorial service?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> grandfather.


When is it?


Tomorrow. Hold on.


It's past midnight, so today.


Do you remember a lot about him?


No, I don't.


I want to remember everything about him,


but it keeps fading away.


His voice, his gaze, and his hands…


He had rough palms, you see.


He was a sailor who then ran an oil shop


after my parents passed away,
so it's what you'd expect.


But his hands were so big
and exceptionally warm.


He raised me with them.


I bet you were a troublemaker
when you were little.


The boy in the photo
has "mischief" written on his face.


I was absolutely
all over the neighborhood.


I stole the squid
the old ladies had hung out to dry


and played soccer all day
until my neck was badly burned.


-Soccer?
-Yes, I loved the sport.


Just like you,
I had a pair of shoes I loved so much.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> blue soccer cleats.


I see.


Do you still enjoy soccer?


No, I don't anymore.
I don't even watch it.


Why not?


Because of soccer…


No, because of me,


my grandfather passed away.


He had a heart attack.


But he wasn't found in time.


If only I hadn't gone out…


to watch the World Cup matches.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t tell me you believe
that he wouldn't have passed away


had you been at home.


Those what-ifs are pointless.


There are too many variables in this world


and they're beyond our control.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> it's not your fault.


You've been thinking that way
all this time?


Your grandpa must've been fuming
in his grave.


Would he be that angry?


Of course.


Isn't this


the first time you talked about yourself?


You're right.


You're the second person


that I've told my personal stories.


Second?


How dense of me.


Tea won't cut it, right?


Are you done?


Second?


-Thank you.
-Enjoy.


Seong-hyeon, I enjoyed your show today.


Me too. You have a great voice.


Thank you so much.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.
-Gosh, he's handsome.


He actually talked to us!


Babe, you look stunning today.


You should've dressed like this sooner.


Hold on. Did you perhaps
dress up like this since it's my birthday?


-Of course not.
-What?


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t be mistaken.


It was for me, not you.


-What?
-You heard me.


You can wear
all the expensive clothes in the world


but you look like the cheapest person,


and I deserve better.


Cheap?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you must've overheard me.


Let me explain.
Let's talk somewhere private.


No. I don't have any more time
to spare you in my life.


The three months I wasted
is more than enough.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin!


Seong-hyeon.


Just a second.


Thanks, Seong-hyeon.


Those heels are pretty.


You know,


I spent two months' salary on these.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> hands shook at first,
but I just went for it.


Come to think of it,


I had never bought anything for myself.


You did good. You need to give
yourself a gift now and then.


But I guess all pretty things have thorns.


I didn't expect to see blood
on my first day wearing them.


-Just a second.
-What?


-These…
-But--


It'll be better
if you soften the back of them.


Nothing's easy at first you know.


Whether it's wearing shoes
or being in a relationship.


Here.


Much better now.


-Why don't we go eat something?
-Sounds good.


-Come on.
-Sure.


That was good.


I could tell.


I was only being polite
since you cooked it for me.


Why did you insist on cooking
with a bad arm though?


Well, I'm never going to let you
do anything in my kitchen again.


Why not?


Someone's calling you.


MI-SEON


Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Mi</span>-seon. Did you get there safely?


-Yes.
-And your mom's surgery?


She was just taken to the operation room.


The doctor told me not to worry
since the procedure


isn't all that invasive.


I'm sure it'll go well, so don't worry.


What about you? Is everything all right?


Here? Of course, everything's good.


I'm fine.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t hurry back,
and be with your mom as long as you want.


You're on indefinite leave.


We'll see.


I've got to go.


Good night.


Sure.


Here, drink this.


-Thank you.
-Sure.


You should head back.
You have work in the morning, right?


It's my day off tomorrow. What about you?


Well, after my mom's surgery is over,


I'll stay until she wakes up


and leave early in the morning
when my sister comes.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin told me to stay here,


but I should still go to work.


We can go together then.


Gosh, no.


Pulling an all-nighter
will only exhaust you.


Besides, I feel bad
you had to run into my father.


It's all right.
I'm more worried about you than myself.


You must be exhausted,
so get some shuteye.


I'll wake you up
as soon as your mother comes out.


But you must be more tired than I am.


I'm used to working the late shift.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I'm not tired at all.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t just stand there. Come lie down.


I feel bad about chasing an injured man
out of his own bed.


Think of it
being reserved for the spooked.


All right, then.


You don't think
someone might break in again, do you?


With me here?


I meant, into my place.


If you want, I'll install
a front gate tomorrow.


What if someone climbs over it?


Then I'll put up a wire fence. No, wait.


Let's plant mines instead.


I'm just saying you can be at ease.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh!
-What the hell?


What was that?


It was only the wind.


-Wind?
-Darn it, it's unusually strong tonight.


-The wind?
-Yes.


It came out of nowhere.


-What now?
-Hey, Bugyeong!


-Bugyeong, you…
-Who's Bugyeong?


Gosh, that startled me.


It's the fishing village chief's dog.


-I see.
-He must've eaten something funny.


He's been howling like a wolf for days.


I see. Well, sweet dreams, Bugyeong.


-Good night.
-Bugyeong--


Go to sleep now.


-Sure.
-I'll be outside.


Okay.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you'd rather stay up all night here?


What else can I do when I can't sleep?


You can go to bed.


I'll put you to sleep in five seconds.


-How?
-Just lie down. You'll find out.


All right.


Wait. Is that poetry?


Yes. To those who don't read
a lot of books like you,


this works like a charm.


I read a lot of books, you know.


Name one that inspired you
in five seconds.


-Five, four--
-Get reading.


Here I go then.


Well…


You can keep listening


or go to sleep.


"Doorkeeper.


'You can't be here.'


Saying that is my job.


It is my job to deny your purpose.


It is also my job
to deny you the next day again.


And waiting for you the next day
in order to deny you


is also my job.


It is my job to fall in love with you


while waiting for you


the next day.


Thus, denying my love…"


Chief Hong.


Who is


the first person you told


about your grandfather?


There was this person.


Someone very warm-hearted.


Damn it.


What? The pervert
that broke into Dr. Yoon's place


is the one who tried to abduct Ms. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Yu</span>?


-Exactly.
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


I just got back
from testifying at the police station.


-No way.
-Lieutenant Kim said


he has 11 priors.


-What?
-Eleven priors?


They found a truckload of
women's clothes that he'd stolen.


Remember that red bra of mine I mentioned?


He's the one who took it.


It was among the items he stole.


That son of a bitch.


-He must've stolen my dress then!
-Right.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh. When did that foul man
come to live here in Gongjin?


About two months ago,


after wandering around
after getting out of prison.


But he couldn't shake the habit.


That damn pervert!


He deserves to have
his limbs ripped piece by piece.


That son of a bitch deserves hell.


-That pervert--
-Can I see him if I go to the station?


You foolish…


By the way, is it <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Sunday</span>?
Why are you here?


You should be in school!


-Yes, you should be in school.
-Stop nagging me!


-Go on.
-You'll be late again.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin!
-You--


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


I'll text you later,
so tell me all the details. Bye!


-Dr. Yoon!
-Dr. Yoon, are you all right?


Hello, all.


I was so shocked to hear what happened.


I heard he cut your arm with a knife.


It must hurt. Oh, dear.


Goodness. Dr. Yoon,


you look haggard now.


-Are you all right?
-Once again, rumors travel fast.


I'll tell you.
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.


And as you can see,
Ms. Dentist seems fine too.


Who are you to speak for me?


She's right. Be quiet.


Anyway, I'm fine.


I'm sorry for concerning you.


Please don't say that.
As your landlady, I'm completely ashamed.


I'll get you a security system right away.


-Yes, you should.
-Thank you.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> the meantime, have this calming pill.


Taking this when you've been startled


will calm your heart right back down.
Have it now.


There. Go ahead.


-Thank you.
-Sure thing.


There you go.


Chew and swallow even though it's bitter.


Ms. Gam-ri, what about me? Where's mine?


Well, I only had one at home.


I'll get you one later on.


Dr. Yoon, I brought this from my store.


Have some honey water.


What? Again, where's mine?


-Seriously?
-Because I only had one.


Are you actually on your way to work?


Shouldn't you be taking the day off?


I can't let the clinic close for the day.


Then stay right here.
I'll get you a cup of coffee.


-Your favorite, iced Americano.
-No, it's fine.


I just want to get you some, so wait here.


What about me?


-Where's mine?
-Stop it.


By the way,


how did Chief Hong
come to your aid last night?


I'm glad he did,


but were you two there together
that late at night?


This I should hear.


Right? You guys
showed up here together as well.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


I have to say,
the curiosity is killing me.


Why on earth are you all giggling?


Because we're curious.


Gosh.


Is it just me, or is everyone
more worried about you than me?


Why do you keep following me?


You'll end up at the clinic at this rate.


That's where I'm headed.


Why?


To get a free cup of coffee.


Today, I'm craving instant coffee.


We do serve a great instant coffee.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin!
-Du-sik!


Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eun</span>-cheol.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Mi</span>-seon.


How come you're here together?


We heard about what happened last night.


Are you all right?


Why didn't you say anything
when I called last night?


I didn't want you to worry.


I'm fine, so don't worry.


How's your mom?


Yes, her surgery went well.


It's all thanks to you.


That's a relief.


I told you to stay by her side.


Why did you hurry back here?


Well, I'm glad I did.


Look what happened overnight!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


I won't leave you ever again.


I'll be right next to you
as if we were joined at the hip.


Talk about déjà vu.


Tell me about it.


Are you all right though?
I heard you hurt your arm.


Where does it hurt?


-Which--
-Let go.


-Were you terrified?
-Yes.


-Are you crying?
-It was scary.


-Of course.
-But…


What's the deal with Officer Choi?


Oh, that?


Well, he drove me
to the hospital in Seoul.


He even stayed with me
until my mom was out of surgery,


and drove me back here.


What?


That's what I call
being taken out of the friend zone.


While he sat with me outside the OR,


I was reminded of old memories.


When my dad was hospitalized,


Pil-seung never came to visit him
at the hospital.


He was afraid
my parents might bring up marriage


if he met them.


I knew we should've killed
that rat bastard.


At first, it was <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Eun</span>-cheol's looks
that I was drawn to.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> heart beats faster for those
who look like Hong Kong movie stars.


-Right.
-But now I'm in trouble.


I think I'm in love with him.


Wait. Isn't that a good thing though?


Yeong-guk,
I've never had any romantic feelings


for you.


I hope we can continue being good friends.


You'll never know why I wanted a divorce.


Fine. Let's keep it that way forever.


Just live your life.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> goodness. You startled me.


Why are you acting like you saw a ghost?


Damn it.
The stress could actually kill me.


Always the scaredy-cat.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what brings you by?


I'm here on official business, sir.


Is that so? Then have a seat, ma'am.


I'm sure you're aware of the unfortunate
incident that took place last night.


Yes. I mean, yes, ma'am.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> the zone chiefs
and area chiefs discussed


and decided to form
a civilian patrol unit.


And that's final.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you discuss it with City Hall


to get us extra security measures


such as security cameras and alarm bells.


-Answer me.
-Sure.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t just say yes, and do it.


I'll be counting the days starting today.


Hold on a second.


Are you leaving already?


I said my piece, so why should I stay?


Well, I'm not done yet.


We need to talk about a private matter.


-What you said yesterday--
-I have nothing more to say.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hwa</span>-jeong, please. I--
-Hello?


Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Yun</span>-gyeong.


Yes, sure thing.


I should be there today.


Yes, of course. Got it.


What is it?


What the hell is it?


Tell me what it is. It's driving me nuts!


Just tell me already!


Fix it for me!


Dad, please!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Bo</span>-ra, come on.


How can you act this way


when your parents work
their fingers to the bone


to provide for you?


I-jun, I'm fine.


I'm a merciful saint.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> game console!


What's with this quiet yet familiar scene?


-Hey.
-Hi, Uncle Hong.


Hey, I-jun.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Bo</span>-ra, who on earth upset you?


Uncle Du-sik,
Dad won't fix my game console.


Is that so? Is that what upset you?


Oh, my. Look at these big drops of tears.


But you should know
it's not that he won't fix it.


He just can't.


He's a fool, you see.


No matter what happens,


-I will not lose my cool.
-I'll fix it for you.


I'm a genius.


Where is it? I-jun, can you get it for me?


Thanks.


Let me see. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> this is it.


Screwdriver.


You seem fine for someone
who got nicked by a knife.


-Are you disappointed?
-No.


I'm relieved, that's all.


I guess I was worried.


-I have an order to place.
-<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t.


-It's--
-Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Yun</span>-gyeong.


I called to say that I'm closing up
my hardware store for good.


-It's--
-You're busy, so I should shut up?


-It's--
-I love you too.


-It's--
-<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t say it.


-Hey--
-Quiet.


-I'm merciful.
-Your dad is what?


-A fool. And I'm what?
-I'm a saint.


PLACEMENT OF ORDER
WINDOW LOCK


Wait.


Isn't that Director <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>'s car?


WRITER WANG


Hello?


Are you insane?


How can the main director
not show up for editing?


You're right to call me insane.


What is it? Where are you right now?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> Gongjin.


What? Why are you still there?


No way.


Does this concern your good luck charm?


Dr. Yoon?


I've known you for seven years,


but I've never seen you this way.


Seong-hyeon.


A ship can't be navigated properly
without its captain.


Sorry.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Ji</span>-won, can you cut me some slack
just for one day?


Just today.


Starting tomorrow,
I'll pull myself together again.


It's just for today then.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t let your personal life
affect work again.


Until when will you see me
only as a co-worker?


CHIEF HONG


But he doesn't have any relatives.


Is he hosting the memorial service
all by himself?


Aren't you getting off?


I have a few things to sort out.
You should head home first.


Should I wait?


No, don't.
You must be tired from the long night,


so go home and rest.


Then come home before it gets too dark


and call me if anything happens.


Got it. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See</span> you later.


Sure.


Ms. Pyo.


If you're free,


can we have some coffee?


Didn't you say coffee?


Well, that's just something
people commonly say.


I prefer beverages
that taste like herbal tonics.


Anyway, I asked you to have coffee with me


to say something.


I have something to say too.


Sorry? Then you should go first.


Okay.


Well…


I wanted to thank you once again
for what you did yesterday.


There's no need.
I just did what I needed to do.


Right. Your occupation
requires you to serve the people,


and you offered me your services
for two days.


Right?


Sorry?


I've dated my fair share of guys.


I was offended when you talked
about how easily I start dating,


but you were right.


And that time,
my feelings for you weren't serious.


However,


those feelings ended up
growing into something more.


I'm scared that they might grow


as big and tall as Jack's beanstalk.


But that's not me, you see.


-Ms. Pyo--
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I…


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I…


have decided to put a lid on my feelings.


Sorry?


I'll put some distance between us
so that you won't feel uncomfortable.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you can keep being comfortable with me


and only consider me
as one of the citizens.


ASSORTED JEON FOR SALE


Is he inside?


-No, I'm out here.
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh!


You startled me.
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t sneak up on people like that.


Is spying and being shameless
your specialty?


You're in my yard.


What brings you by?


You said it's your grandfather's
memorial service today.


You can't cook since you hurt your arm,
so I picked up some jeon--


Chief Hong!


-Hey, Dr. Yoon.
-Hello, Ms. Yeo.


What brings you by?


I cooked these as a snack
but made too much.


Serve them for today's service.


A snack? This is too much.


It's really nothing.


Starting from the bottom,
there's beef jeon,


-croaker jeon,
-Croaker.


pollack jeon, tofu jeok,
and flat meatballs.


Nothing, did you say?
It doesn't get more luxurious than this.


This is the least I could do.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> family got out of the hole


after we took over
his oil shop 20 years ago.


We'll return the favor for generations.


Is I-jun on board with that?


I-jun's motto is to carry
one's gratitude beyond the grave.


-I'll get going then.
-Thanks, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hwa</span>-jeong.


-Have a good day.
-Thanks!


-Bye.
-Bye.


Thanks!


What were you saying again?


Well, I bought some jeon--


-Goodness.
-Hello, ladies.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh. Ms. Gam-ri, what is all this?


-Give it here.
-Chief Hong.


It's red snow crab.


-Gosh.
-Let me take that.


You're supposed to serve octopus,
but it's currently a closed season.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> I steamed some crabs instead.


-Gosh--
-I seasoned some vegetables for you.


-Ms. Mat-i.
-Chief Hong,


I made beef radish soup. It's still hot.


Ms. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Suk</span>-ja, this must've been heavy.


-I got you some pollack and halibut.
-I see.


-Thanks, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Nam</span>-suk.
-Sure.


I brought some jujube and chestnuts.


Geum-cheol peeled the latter for you.


You brought this over
when you're close to popping?


-Du-sik.
-Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Chun</span>-jae.


These are apples and pears.


-Gosh.
-I just found them on the street.


-Watch it.
-Goodness.


Since I can't cook,


I bought some hangwa and yakgwa.


-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes, hello.


Everyone knows everything
in this neighborhood.


As if it's anything new.


Shouldn't you get on it?


Yes, I should.


Do you need any help?


No, I can handle it on my own.


Thank you, everyone.


It's nothing new.


We just have a lot of free time.


I can't believe what I'm seeing.


Are you really the dentist I know?


Did someone assume your identity?


That sure is a lame joke.


Stop that and just take this.


Just a second.


-What are you doing?
-Didn't you buy this for my grandpa?


I did, but--


You got it from the market, right?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> grandpa especially loved
their perilla leaf jeon.


You sure have an eye for good food.


MAY YOU REST IN PEACE


I should get going.


Enjoy your time with your grandfather.


You can stay if you want.


What?


If you want.


Grandpa.


It sure is a feast today, isn't it?


Everyone in the neighborhood pitched in.


Please enjoy whatever you want.


There's a lot that you like.


Would you like to say hello?


Hello.


I'm Yoon <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.


A 34-year-old dentist.


I hope we get along.


What's with the introduction?


You told me to say hello.


We'll eat in ten minutes.


He was always a fast eater, you see.


Chief Hong, you spoke in a dialect.


This is my hometown after all.
I spoke in one when I was a boy.


Right, of course.


Snow crab at a memorial service
is a rare sight for me.


It's my first time serving it.
He used to love it though.


I see. You and him must have
liked different taste in food.


You don't like snow crab.


Me? Not at all.


What? But that's what you said.


What should we have? Snow crab?


No. Something else.


That's because
I couldn't be bothered at the time.


I enjoy crabs,
but peeling them is a hassle.


Besides, there are so many other dishes.


I see.


What are you doing?


Did you just…


peel it for me?


Well, it must be even more bothersome


with that injured arm.


Thanks.


Sure thing.


Gosh.


This was your plan all along.


Of course not.
It landed near your right dimple though.


-Where? Here?
-Here. Eat it.


There you go.


Unbelievable.


You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?


-Of course not. It really was a mistake.
-Aren't you?


It won't happen again, so enjoy.


Really?


Shrimps and crabs are
too bothersome to eat.


Compared to the effort you put in,


the outcome is too small.


It's still delicious though.


I know. Come to think of it,
my grandpa is the only one


who's ever peeled them for me.


Right. Peeling these are a true hassle.


It takes a lot of love
to do this for someone else.


Well…


However, right now,


this is a special occasion.


It's my fault you got injured.


You're right.
This will take four weeks to recover.


It hurts.


-Just eat.
-Okay.


It's good.


It's really good.


Wait. Let me walk you home.


You don't have to.
You have a lot to tidy up.


Forget about that. It's dark outside.
Think about what happened last night.


I live right around the corner


and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Mi</span>-seon's home today.


-I can call her on my way home.
-But still--


No, don't walk me out.


Bye. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t walk me out.


But…


Did I really say "love"?


What the hell was I babbling on about?


I should sew my lips together for good.


Hey, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.


Seong-hyeon?


Were you waiting for me?


Yes.


You should've called.


How was your trip to Seoul?


What? Oh, it was good.


I asked you to spare me some time
once I got back from Seoul.


Can you spare me some now?
Or is this a bad time?


-Right now?
-Yes.


We should eat. I'm hungry.


Sure thing.


I'm sorry about this.
I already had dinner.


Are you okay eating alone?


Yes, of course.


Go ahead before the ice melts.


Okay.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.
-Yes?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.


Yes?


I…


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.


Yes, that's me.


Right.


Jeez.


I'm sorry to ask,
but could you say "Action" for me?


"Action"?


Yes, I practiced a whole speech for today,


but I'm finding it
hard to actually say it.


Can you do it for me?


I don't know what this is about,


but here goes. "Action."


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, there's one thing
I regret in life, and that's…


And that's…


What is it?


Well, it's…


You see…


Seong-hyeon, could it be…


Yes?


Are you in financial trouble?


What? No, that's not it.


If that's the case,


I could lend you some
although it wouldn't be much.


Not telling you how I felt.


I've been regretting
not telling you how I felt 14 years ago.


Then I ran into you again in Gongjin,


and I thought long and hard about it.


I didn't know if the butterflies
in my stomach were due to my past feelings


or if they're the feelings
I have for you currently.


The conclusion I came to is this.


I like you.


Just like I did all those years ago.


No, even more than that.


I like you a lot.


Gosh, please don't.


I don't want to burden you.


And I'm not asking
for an immediate answer.


I just wanted to tell you
before it was too late.


I didn't want to regret it again.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> gosh.


I think I can finally eat.


I'll really have this all myself.


Sure. Go ahead.


This looks delicious.


It's so good.


Grandpa.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> friend was a bit loud, wasn't she?


That's just how she is.


She talks and giggles a lot.


You easily get distracted in her presence.


Still…


it feels empty now that she's not around.


What took you so long?


Oh, I met up with Seong-hyeon.


He was waiting for me outside.


For what reason at this hour?


What? Did he confess
his feelings for you or something?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Mi</span>-seon.


Get ready for a career change.


You're firing me over a joke?


No, I'm saying you should
set up shop as a fortune teller.


Really?


Right? What did I tell you?


I told you
Seong-hyeon had feelings for you.


Wait. Why don't you seem happy?


It's just complicated, that's all.


What could possibly be complicated?


He's from a nice family and has
a good job and a great personality.


He's the man of your dreams.


Besides, you used to have a crush on him.


Fate brought you together again,


and he finally confessed his feelings,


so what's holding you back?


It's just that…


Because of Chief Hong?


Are you serious?


No, it's not.
Anyway, that's enough about me.


What about you?


How are things between
you and Officer Choi?


I told him I'd back off.


-What?
-He's right, you know.


I don't take relationships seriously
and I'm scared of commitment.


But you finally met
someone you truly like.


And I think
there's a chance for something real,


but you're backing down?


What's with us both?


No wonder we're friends.


How about we go to Seoul this weekend?


Seoul?


I mean, we'll never be able
to take our mind off these things here.


And I could really use some diversion.


We could go shopping
and eat something delicious.


Yes, and have fun at a hotel!


-Yes!
-Yes!


Let's do this
We're off to Seoul


Off we go.


I'm stoked right now.
What should we do first?


Isn't it obvious?
First, we visit your mom.


No need for that. She already
got better and is now at my aunt's.


Besides, she grew sick of me
after seeing me for two days in a row.


Really?


Then what should we do? Any ideas?


Shopping? No, wait.


How about a hotel pool?


No, let's get a massage at the spa.


Why choose when we can do them all?


Seriously. Could you be any smarter?


-Hey.
-Yes?


I see you did your hair
for our trip to Seoul.


Those are some sweet curls you put in.


I know. The curling iron
worked well today…


What is it?


-Oh, no.
-What is it?


Damn it. I think I left it plugged in.


What?


What do I do? Should we head back?


Unbelievable.


What are you doing? Who are you calling?


-What?
-The emergency service?


No, Chief Hong.


Right, there's always Chief Hong.


No. No way!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t call Chief Hong. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hang</span> up!


-No, don't!
-Chief Hong?


No! I'm serious. You can't!


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t!


Is that Ms. Dentist?
Please tell her to be quiet.


Chief Hong, could I offer you an easy job?


What is it?


Could you go to my place right now,


enter <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin's room,
locate the dressing table,


and unplug the curling iron on it?


What? You've got to be kidding me.
You can do that yourself.


We're currently far away from the house.


-Where?
-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> Seoul.


You went to Seoul? When will you be back?


Tomorrow.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> please help us out this once.


You can't let us burn down
Ms. Yeo's house.


Right, I'll get it done.
That's all you need, right?


-Yes! He'll do it.
-No, wait.


Chief Hong, all you need to do
is enter the house,


take a left, and unplug the curling iron.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t look at--


He hung up.


Damn it.


Whatever.


Yes, whatever.


Let's just go.


Who knew I'd be doing a job like this?


Stay calm. You expected this.


You didn't expect her
to keep the house pristine.


That's right.


Damn it.


What the hell?


Are you kidding me?


I can't believe
they made me waste my time.


Damn it.


All right.


Here too.


Good.


And now…


All done.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, look. Do you think it'll suit me?


Yes, it's adorable
and will look good on you.


Right? I guess I have my figure to thank.


I should still try it on though.


Sure. There's a fitting room over there.


Really? Just a second. This is adorable.


It'll look good on him.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin!
-Yes?


No way! Twirl for me.


Wait. Like this?


It's pretty. It's perfect for you.


No, this isn't the one.
Let's go over there instead.


-Sure.
-I bet they have prettier ones.


Hey. What do you think of this?


It's a nice shade of purple.
You should check it out.


How is it? Is it good?


It's so good


that I wouldn't notice
even if the others stopped breathing.


Must you always be that annoying?


Is seeing me die something you want?


I only meant it in a figurative sense.


Ms. Gam-ri.


How is it?


Why do people even
have something like this?


It's sickly sweet
and too cold for my teeth.


But you enjoyed it the most.


That's only because it's so hot.


By the way, where's the restroom?


It's right over there.


Mat-i, I'm coming with you.


Why on earth would you
follow me to the restroom?


Because I want to go too.


I should get them new dishes.


-That hurts.
-Of course it does.


Weren't you aware of that
when you took the knife for her?


The situation called for the action.


Du-sik, you have feelings
for the dentist, don't you?


Not this again.


We're just friends.


I turned 80 this year.


All my life, I've been diving under water
fishing out abalones and sea urchins.


I can now see through people
like I see through water.


She has taken up
all the space in your heart,


so why on earth are you fighting it?


Du-sik, life may seem long,


but it really isn't.


Throw away unnecessary thoughts


and be honest with yourself.


Okay?


HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT


Cho-hui!


It's a little early for dinner,


but it's better than having it late.


I was hungry anyway. Thank you.


I hope it's not too salty.


It's perfect.


I heard from the police
that you gave them a statement.


Thank you.


I'm so relieved he was caught.


It could've been terrible
for you and Dr. Yoon.


Right.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> how have you been?


How's your mother?
Didn't she suddenly collapse back then?


She passed away last year.


She needed help after collapsing,


so I took care of her.


Your mother must've tried very hard
to stay by her daughter's side longer.


It must've been hard on you too.


What about your brother?
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t you have one?


He emigrated to the US
about ten years ago.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> it's just you.


Loneliness must've drawn you back here.


You used to love seokbakji.


I still remember you devouring it
when you first rented our room.


You remember that?


It must be because
I value eating the most.


I tend to remember
things related food well.


Meanwhile, Yeong-guk
gets the blues every season,


so no wonder he and I don't get along.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hwa</span>-jeong,


Yeong-guk and I--


I heard.


But what happened isn't your fault.


Mom!


Why keep the floor this slippery?


Ms. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Yu</span>!


Hi, I-jun.


Hello.


I-jun, did you have fun today?


-Hey.
-Hey.


Would you like some dinner too?


No, I have urgent business
and should get going.


Have fun.


Gosh.


It's fine.


He won't die, so eat up.


It sure is nice to be here.


Now I know why everyone
wants an apartment by <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Han</span> River.


Is that so?


What's with that dry response?


Maybe I've been away for too long,


but <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Han</span> River is narrower than I remember.


What?


I mean, compared to the sea
I always look at in Gongjin.


I see.


We haven't had a course meal in ages.


Gosh, this smell of butter.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, we're having lobster.


I love my life. I really do.


Why are you giggling?


Oh, it's just that the lobster
reminded me of something.


Recently, I had red snow crabs
with Chief Hong


and the crab meat got on his face
as I snapped the shell open.


That was so funny.


You haven't tried them, have you?


They're much better
than imported lobsters.


Maybe it's because
it was directly from Gongjin Harbor,


but the crab meat was so sweet and soft.


There wasn't any sauce,
but it was still delicious.


-<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin.
-Yes?


You've been weird today.


How so?


You're not yourself.


At the department store,


though you acted like
you'd max out your credit card,


you didn't buy any shoes or clothes.


All you did was look at men's clothes.


When did I ever--


And even now,


you keep talking about Gongjin


as if all roads lead to it.


Right.


Why am I being a party pooper?


You know what?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">In</span> order to get
the Gongjin vibe out of me,


we should go to a spa after this.


Sure. Sounds good.


It's so good. I absolutely love it.


It's raining.


The forecast never mentioned one.


Maybe it's a shower.


But we need to head to the parking lot.


You have an umbrella, right?


It's not far away, so let's run.


What?


Why do you keep acting weird?


What do you mean?


You hate getting wet in the rain.


Feeling uncomfortable and damp
is your worst nightmare.


Are you nuts? I'm all drenched!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span>? <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t you feel refreshed?


No, I don't.
It feels uncomfortable and damp.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> what?
Let your hair down and just feel it.


You're bound to meet
unexpected situations in life.


Even if you use an umbrella,
you'll end up getting drenched.


Just put your hands up
and welcome the rain.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, what's with you?


Where'd you get this?


On the street.


-Are you okay?
-Chief Hong?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">So</span> you're okay.


It's so hot.


I guess someone got the romance going.


It's unnecessarily pretty.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t go.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t…


leave me behind.


Ms. Dentist?


Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?


Are you really okay? Did he hurt you?


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin!


What's the matter with you?


You just ran out like some crazy woman,
and it's scaring me.


And you happen to be in a floral dress.
It makes you look crazier!


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Mi</span>-seon.


I think I should go.


Go where?


To Gongjin.


What?


I'll call you later, okay?


Yoon <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin, that crazy wench!


She finally came to a realization.


Congratulations on the level-up.


Way to go, my friend!


What am I supposed to do now?


Chief Hong.


Chief Hong, are you home?


MS. DENTIST


Chief Hong!


Chief Hong.


Ms. Dentist?


I thought you wouldn't be back
until tomorrow.


I couldn't wait until tomorrow
to say this.


I like you.


I have feelings for you.


I'm one of those people
who plan every second of their lives


according to a lifespan of 99 years.


I don't like people crossing the line
or crossing it myself.


And I'm fond of expensive shoes.


I guess I'm your complete opposite.


It's the same with
our blood types and personalities.


I bet we're not compatible in any aspect.


We're probably as different as
penguins that eat krill


and polar bears that feed on sea lions.


But to hell with all of that…


because I like you.


Ms. Dentist, I--


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Don</span>'t say anything.


I'm not asking anything from you.


I…


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">My</span> feelings for you
keep inflating my heart,


and it could burst at any second.


I can't help it anymore.


I…


I can't…


deny it anymore either.


Do you like them?


I love them! I'm going to
play soccer in these every day.


Stop gawking at the shoes


and blow out the candles on your cake.


No, I have to make a wish first.


Please let me and Grandpa
live a long and happy life together.


Blow them out already
before the cake gets covered in wax.


I won't ask for much,


so please grant this old man's wish.


When Du-sik ends up all alone,


please send him someone


so that he won't be lonely.


Please send him someone
who will be good for him.


All right. One,


two…


three!


That little girl…


was Ms. Dentist?


Can we hold off being a couple
for a few days?


Are you having second thoughts
now that you have to dump him?


I want time to sort out
the past I've had with Seong-hyeon


and the time I'll be spending with you.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hye</span>-jin dumped me.
She says that she already likes someone.


Today's our first day as a couple, right?


Were you always this physically oriented?


Why don't you lock
the front door from now on?


Chief Hong!


I've lived for 34 years without you,


but each day seems
to last forever since I've met you.<br />
