        <p className="font-mono text-sm">In a world where cultural imperialism once reigned supreme in the media industry, Netflix has emerged as a disruptive force, dominating the global streaming landscape. Amanda D Lotz&apos;s 2022 journal, &quot;Netflix, library analysis, and globalization: rethinking mass media flows&quot;, sheds light on Netflix&apos;s unique approach to content sourcing and circulation, highlighting its data-centric strategy that optimizes foreign show and movie recommendations. By analyzing the popularity and genres of romance TV shows across the world, I aim to uncover the intricate dynamics of transnational media flows in the streaming era.</p>

        <p className="font-mono text-sm">The study will delve into the top 3 shows in the genre of romance from Netflix data published between June 28, 2021 and June 20, 2023, evaluating their global popularity and duration in the Netflix Top 10 list. Additionally, this study seeks to differentiate cultural actions &amp; contexts surrounding romance by analyzing a corpus of comments and opinion post on social media platforms by viewers. By comparing these findings, I seek to discern patterns of audience preferences and cultural resonance, providing valuable insights into the evolving landscape of global entertainment consumption.
